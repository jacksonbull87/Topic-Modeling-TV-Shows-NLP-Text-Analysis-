97,Here’s what NBC’s Peacock streaming service will look like when it launches this July ,2020-01-16,Julia Alexander,"Much like competitors , and , Comcast’s streaming service, Peacock, is going to be entirely reliant on hubs. ,Comcast and NBCUniversal gave an in-depth look at Peacock, which ,, during a special investors event this afternoon at 30 Rock in New York City. There are more than 600 engineers working on the platform, according to Matt Strauss, head of Peacock. The streaming platform is based on the infrastructure that Sky in the UK has used for its own streaming options. ,During the presentation, Strauss walked investors and viewers through the Peacock interface. There are three different areas that subscribers can use when they open the app: channels, trending, and browse. While people are thinking of which option they want to click on, a video will play automatically. It may be the news, or part of a game, or a show, but the idea is that “when you launch it immediately starts playing video, just like TV,” Strauss said. The first image in the gallery below shows an example from a story about , from NBC News Now. ,Once people open up browse, they’ll be able to cycle through the ,. These are broken down into a series of rows similar to Netflix and Disney+. The first two rows are based on shows that people are already watching (“Continue Watching”) and new additions to the Peacock app. ,As viewing habit data is collected, machine learning algorithms will help to make titles that appear on the homepage more personalized. This is how Netflix operates and how the upcoming HBO Max app will operate as well. Emphasis will then be placed on Peacock Originals in subsequent rows, followed with recommendations for existing titles that might be of interest. Peacock will also come with a kids section, like every other streaming app, that is entering the streaming space this year. ,Then there’s the trending section. Peacock will also offer short-form content on a daily basis, including sports highlights, pop culture updates, and shorter news segments. Late-night clips, for example, ,. This includes ,clips that people may have missed — Strauss referred to it as the ability to get rid of the “FOMO” (fear of missing out) you might experience by missing a late-night episode right when it airs. This can help NBCUniversal pull subscribers away from YouTube, where many of these highlights already live after the live airing, and over to Peacock — if everything goes according to plan. ,The third section is channels. NBC is a linear network that wants to remind people how important television is, so Peacock is designed to try to replicate the look of traditional television, Strauss says. Subscribers can pull up a channel guide to scroll through, much like we already do with cable packages now, and see what’s on. They can select from TV shows, news, sports, and movies, as well as look into specific types of content hubs. A ,hub, for example, will also get a “channel” look for people to browse through if they like. ,These are Peacock’s three sections, but there are more product features like curation around specific shows. For instance, fans of NBC’s ,will be able to , and then select from a character like Michael or Jim and watch episodes that are centric to those characters, or are seen as some of the best. There are “beginner” options that give new viewers a chance to figure out the best episodes to watch, too. This is a type of human curation WarnerMedia is using to try to market its upcoming competitor HBO Max. ,More of the Peacock interface, including a look at some of the profile avatar options that will be available, can be seen in the gallery above.

98,Netflix will nearly double the number of French language originals,2020-01-17,Nick Statt,"Netflix today signaled a significant new investment in France with the , and a content roadmap that will see the streaming service nearly double the number of French language originals it has produced so far. Since 2014, Netflix has produced 24 productions in French, including six films and nine television series. But the new plan is to add 20 new productions, and to grow its new corporate presence in Paris consisting of 40 employees to one nearly three times the size. ,Netflix is doing similar expansions across the globe, including elsewhere in Europe and in South America. The company has plans to ,, and last year it ,. It also has offices in England, the Netherlands, and Spain. ,The goal is to diversify its lineup of shows and movies to attract more international customers, especially as growth in its US subscriber base has hit its upper limit and competition from domestic giants like Disney and HBO heats up. Last July, the number of Netflix customers in the US ,. That’s made Netflix’s focus on international expansion more crucial than ever before. ,Netflix has had successful run with foreign language shows, including Spanish language crime thriller hits like ,and , and German language sci-fi show ,. It’s also struck gold with some of its foreign language films, including Oscar nominated ,from Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón. And Netflix is investing heavily in Japanese language content, including securing the ,, as another segment of the streaming wars now includes an , both new and old. ,Yet while expanding its presence in a country like France is arguably good for business, there’s also a legal reason at play. The European Parliament , new regulation regarding Netflix and other streaming services’ presence in the EU that mandates that at least 30 percent of all content carried on the platform be originally produced in the region. Amazon, Netflix, and other companies have until September 2020 to hit that quota. So it’s likely Netflix’s new investments in Germany, Italy, and France will help it do so. ,There’s also Netflix’s somewhat contentious relationship with the French cinema community, after the company’s high-profile showdown with the Cannes Film Festival over contest eligibility requirements. Netflix was , due to its limited theatrical runs, which ran afoul of France’s new rules around local releases and, more broadly, the country’s cultural commitment to cinema as an institution. ,Netflix then pulled out of the festival officially, and it ,.

99,Netflix reveals that 76 million people watched at least two minutes of The Witcher,2020-01-21,Chaim Gartenberg,", and so are the first official numbers for Netflix’s latest streaming hit ,. The company says the series was watched by 76 million households, making it the most-watched first season of television ever for Netflix. That’s according to Netflix’s newly unveiled definition of “watched,” which it changed from “watched 70 percent of a single episode of a series” to anyone who “chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes.” ,In explaining the new metric, Netflix notes that the two-minute time period is meant to be “long enough to indicate the choice was intentional,” and it says that it follows similar metrics used by BBC’s iPlayer, YouTube, and ,’ measurements of page views. But the reasoning behind the change is obvious: to juice viewer numbers, with Netflix acknowledging that the new two-minute metric is “about 35% higher on average than the prior metric.” ,To put that number in perspective, two minutes of , is less time than it takes to reach the opening credits of the first episode; the action-packed cold opening is coincidentally two minutes and 16 seconds long. By Netflix’s new metric, anyone who watched just the opening scene of the episode (or 3.2 percent of the total runtime of the episode, which is itself one of eight episodes) is now counted as a view for the entire season. That is also shorter than the amount of time it would take to listen to the hit song “,,” which is also featured in the series.,Still, no matter how you slice it, 76 million households in the first four weeks is a lot of eyes on ,, which Netflix says is “tracking to be our biggest season one TV series ever.” And apparently that’s enough for Netflix to invest in the show for the long haul, as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said , is a “massive new franchise that we’ll develop season after season” in a ,. It was , before season one aired, but Hastings’ comments seem to indicate that it will be a multi-season show.,The company also announced that , from director Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds was viewed by 83 million households in its first four weeks (using the company’s new metric). By comparison, ,, although that doesn’t factor in the 35 percent boost ,’s numbers get from the new two-minute metric.", and so are the first official numbers for netflix s latest streaming hit the company says the series was watched by million households making it the most watched first season of television ever for netflix that s according to netflix s newly unveiled definition of watched which it changed from watched percent of a single episode of a series to anyone who chose to watch and did watch for at least minutes in explaining the new metric netflix notes that the two minute time period is meant to be long enough to indicate the choice was intentional and it says that it follows similar metrics used by bbc s iplayer youtube and measurements of page views but the reasoning behind the change is obvious to juice viewer numbers with netflix acknowledging that the new two minute metric is about higher on average than the prior metric to put that number in perspective two minutes of is less time than it takes to reach the opening credits of the first episode the action packed cold opening is coincidentally two minutes and seconds long by netflix s new metric anyone who watched just the opening scene of the episode or percent of the total runtime of the episode which is itself one of eight episodes is now counted as a view for the entire season that is also shorter than the amount of time it would take to listen to the hit song which is also featured in the series still no matter how you slice it million households in the first four weeks is a lot of eyes on which netflix says is tracking to be our biggest season one tv series ever and apparently that s enough for netflix to invest in the show for the long haul as netflix ceo reed hastings said is a massive new franchise that we ll develop season after season in a it was before season one aired but hastings comments seem to indicate that it will be a multi season show the company also announced that from director michael bay and starring ryan reynolds was viewed by million households in its first four weeks using the company s new metric by comparison although that doesn t factor in the percent boost s numbers get from the new two minute metric ,first official number netflix latest streaming hit company say series watched million household making watched first season television ever netflix according netflix newly unveiled definition watched changed watched percent single episode series anyone chose watch watch least minute explaining new metric netflix note two minute time period meant long enough indicate choice intentional say follows similar metric used bbc iplayer youtube measurement page view reasoning behind change obvious juice viewer number netflix acknowledging new two minute metric higher average prior metric put number perspective two minute le time take reach opening credit first episode action packed cold opening coincidentally two minute second long netflix new metric anyone watched opening scene episode percent total runtime episode one eight episode counted view entire season also shorter amount time would take listen hit song also featured series still matter slice million household first four week lot eye netflix say tracking biggest season one series ever apparently enough netflix invest show long haul netflix ceo reed hastings said massive new franchise develop season season season one aired hastings comment seem indicate multi season show company also announced director michael bay starring ryan reynolds viewed million household first four week using company new metric comparison although factor percent boost number get new two minute metric,2020-01-01,210,official watched household watched newly unveiled definition watched changed watched single anyone chose explaining metric period meant indicate choice intentional metric bbc iplayer measurement page view reasoning obvious juice acknowledging metric higher average prior metric perspective reach opening credit packed cold opening coincidentally metric anyone watched opening total runtime counted view shorter amount listen song featured slice household four eye tracking apparently invest haul reed hastings massive develop aired hastings comment indicate multi bay starring ryan reynolds viewed household four metric comparison factor boost metric

The Hooded Justice episode, in particular, was worth watching the entire season for. That hour is perhaps a better encapsulation of the show than the entirety of the show, and it feels so true to the book that it hardly seems like it wasn’t in there in the first place.,I did find the series’ structure a little frustrating, though. Very little actually happens during the timeline of the show — there’s a murder, some flashbacks, and then the ending arrives. Nearly everything important occurred before the show started, and we just have to wait for characters to reveal to us what they’ve already done.

108,"New trailers: Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Netflix’s Taylor Swift documentary, and more",2020-01-25,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I feel like war movies all too often take the form of action films focused on big, broad, and misguided emotions like glory. So it was a wonderful surprise watching ,, one of the first World War II movies I’ve seen in some time that actually has something meaningful to say.,The film does a brilliant job of satirizing the harmful ways people are divided by language and fear. It focuses on a young boy in 1940s Germany who subscribes to Nazi ideology to fit in. It mostly leads to sadness and embarrassment as he begins to realize that everything he’s been told is wrong.,Some of the most revealing moments are big and obvious, like another child being surprised to see that everything he’d learned about Jews was a lie. But the best moments are the quiet ones, when the adults nod along, knowing the lies retold by children are outlandish, but declining to say so. Now as much as ever, it feels like an important issue to explore.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Disney+’s next big , release is a new season of ,, a much-loved animated series that hasn’t had new episodes since 2014. Disney is billing this as the show’s final season, so this isn’t exactly a way to keep Disney+ filled with new , content. But the rest of the show is available to stream, too, which should mean there’s plenty for people who haven’t seen the series yet. The new season debuts February 21st.,It doesn’t really matter whether , is a very good documentary or not — it has intimate access to Taylor Swift, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of her latest album, and promises to explore much of the drama that surrounds her: people are going to watch it one way or another. Netflix picked up the film before it could hit Sundance, and it’ll head to the streaming service January 31st.,Jon Stewart is back with his second film since leaving ,. , looks like a fictionalized spin on the exact type of political nonsense he used to skewer: Democrats desperate to connect, Republicans constantly lying, and pundits going overboard on all of it. The film stars Steve Carell, so it should be fun to see what the two of them make together. It comes out May 29th.,Let’s just start by acknowledging that , is a good title, and that having Alison Brie star is a good decision. From there, I have no idea, and I’ll just say this truly feels like a Netflix movie — not exactly a must see, but very much an O,. It has Brie starring as a lonely woman who seemingly starts to lose it, or be abducted, or probably turn into a horse or something. The film comes out February 7th.,From the name of this movie and still on this trailer, you could easily assume that this is a rom-com about some dapper musician in London. It’s actually a revenge thriller that has Blake Lively stepping into a Bond-like role after being swept up into some conspiracy. It comes out January 31st.,After the international success of ,, one of director Jia Zhangke’s earlier films is getting a US release.

It comes out February 14th., director Dee Rees returns with a film about a journalist who somehow gets tied up in an illegal arms trading scheme. The movie stars Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck and looks like it twists into a socio-political thriller. It comes out February 21st.,Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots star in this strange sci-fi movie about a couple who become trapped in a neighborhood of identical homes and are forced to raise some kind of freaky clone baby. It seems fun, and I’m assuming there’ll be some cutting criticism of suburbia in here. There doesn’t appear to be a release date just yet. (As a side note: At one point, this trailer flashes a huge Rotten Tomatoes logo advertising an 89 percent rating, and while that’s a great score, I still find loudly advertising a B+ to be kind of hilarious. The rating is now at 87 percent.)",i feel like war movies all too often take the form of action films focused on big broad and misguided emotions like glory so it was a wonderful surprise watching one of the first world war ii movies i ve seen in some time that actually has something meaningful to say the film does a brilliant job of satirizing the harmful ways people are divided by language and fear it focuses on a young boy in s germany who subscribes to nazi ideology to fit in it mostly leads to sadness and embarrassment as he begins to realize that everything he s been told is wrong some of the most revealing moments are big and obvious like another child being surprised to see that everything he d learned about jews was a lie but the best moments are the quiet ones when the adults nod along knowing the lies retold by children are outlandish but declining to say so now as much as ever it feels like an important issue to explore check out nine trailers from this week below disney s next big release is a new season of a much loved animated series that hasn t had new episodes since disney is billing this as the show s final season so this isn t exactly a way to keep disney

110,The best anime of 2019,2020-01-31,D. M. Moore,"Hundreds of new anime series come out every year, so it can be difficult to pick out which ones are actually worth watching. With each new anime season, , tries to point fans to interesting new shows via , ,. But it can be hard to judge a series by its cover — or at least by the first few episodes. Some of the best shows each year don’t always make it into those previews. To highlight all of the shows that stood out after a complete watch, we’ve assembled this list of the best new anime of 2019. While it won’t be entirely comprehensive — it only includes series we’ve watched and finished — everything on the list is something we can unequivocally recommend.,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind,A few years back, I wrote a list of recent shows that would be , to anime. The recommendations in it were divided by genre to point people toward avenues they already liked. , has become the show I flatly recommend when asked for suggestions — a series so good it would get the same attention prestige dramas do, if only it were live-action. ,For the animation studio behind the series, WIT, it feels like their capstone work for the decade. It demonstrates everything they learned from making action shows like , and ,, to character dramas such as , and ,. , captures all of that experience and focuses it into a story full of memorable characters, amazingly animated action scenes, and great character drama in the midst of much bigger historical moments. If I had to pick a single best show of the decade, let alone the year, it would be hard not to choose ,.,In , science is a superpower, but it is never used as magic to handwave away something complicated. Instead it relishes in the details, and in the trial-and-error and hypothesizing. At its core, the show is actually about being a scientist: the importance of knowledge, of being inquisitive about the world, and of being ethical in what you use technology to do. It makes science fun by demonstrating how magical it can be, and then shows you how anybody can become a wizard.,is a charming show that forgoes the idea of wish fulfillment. Most shows that feature characters reincarnated in fantasy worlds give them amazing, unique powers. ,instead focuses on an adult librarian taking over the body of Myne, the sickly five-year-old daughter of a poor city guard. It becomes more about the everyday struggles of Myne and her family as she uses her knowledge from our world to try and make books, but also improve the lives of her family and friends without arousing suspicion that she isn’t the real Myne. It’s a show that is ideal for the whole family, or as a way to relax. Even in its most stressful moments, , just feels nice to watch.,It isn’t rare for the anime version of a manga to elevate the source material, as adaptations often rewrite characters or moments of the story with better foresight about later developments. And the addition of sound and animation can expand on and enhance moments in ways just not possible in the comic form. What’s rare about ,’s adaptation is the consistency with which the animation and voice acting enhances the work, not just for specific important scenes, but every episode.,The spectacular action scenes are most noticeable — they’re stylish and easy to follow, even when seemingly impossible things are occurring. In smaller, subtler moments, the animation and voice acting breathe life into the characters and make them more endearing. The best example of this is the way protagonist and titular demon slayer Tanjiro looks genuinely sad when killing a demon. He has genuine pity for them, even though they’re terrible, irredeemable monsters. He has to continue to humanize them, so he can justify continuing to travel with his now-demon sister, looking to cure her. Small characterizations like this speak volumes by making the spectacular climactic moments more emotionally meaningful.,The concept of , a girl starts living with two cousins who both turn into different animals from the Chinese zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex — makes it sound like a comedy romance series in the vein of ,. But , isn’t so lighthearted. It’s more of an emotional gut-punch, episode after episode, as it reveals the terrible things that have happened to each of the characters. They’re never quite what you expect them to be.,But the show isn’t all sadness. It’s an amazingly hopeful story about finding acceptance, finding a family, and working through issues — not with quick solutions, but through sustained care. It finds a great balance between drama, romance, and comedy, which makes those devastating moments land particularly hard., is stressful, hilarious, awkward, heartwarming, melodramatic, cringeworthy, and absolutely brilliant. The show follows the five girls of a high school literature club as they collectively start thinking about sex and adult relationships for the first time. They’re all individually attempting to figure out their feelings and sexuality, and their stories interconnect as they collectively support (and sometimes impede) each other., in some ways is similar to a show like ,, except without the focus on nostalgia and cringe humor. Instead, the show goes for drama with dashes of comedy. It ranges from more lighthearted, cute romantic fare to frank discussions and storylines about queer romance, teen pregnancy, and possibly inappropriate (and sometimes , inappropriate) relationships with adults. It’s a testament to the writing that it manages to deftly navigate tricky subject matter without being problematic or preachy., is a show about Karou, a young single office worker, and the strange lazy bear Rilakkuma who comes to live in her apartment. While Rilakkuma is something of a freeloader, he effectively earns his place in the apartment by teaching Kaoru how to relax from the stresses of her work and relative lack of social life, by finding enjoyment in everyday things. That makes it an incredibly relaxing show. And the amazing stop-motion animation work adds a charming tactility. ,, which makes it marvelously smooth and lively.,The second season of , feels as though there wasn’t a three-year break after the first season. The show continues to be an amazing animation showcase, and watching it often feels like the animators at Bones, the studio that animated both seasons, are showing off and having ,. But what makes both seasons great is the sense of humor and heart on display.,This new season goes to some darker places than the first season. It’s less focused on testing the incredible psychic powers of middle-schooler Mob and more focused on testing his empathy and maturity as he grows up and becomes a person rather than an ultra-powerful psychic force of nature. Even with the darker tone and themes, a wonderful sense of absurdity and humor still grounds the whole series and keeps it from losing its relatability.,Some anime series start off with such strange conceits that they either completely put the audience off or become utterly captivating to understand. , is that sort of show. It follows three middle school boys who get turned into mythical creatures called kappas. They’ll only become human again if they steal a fictional desire-organ from inside the butt of a spirit monster that’s magically stealing items from the city to serve an evil empire of otters.,The real crux of the show, which is hidden beneath all the strange kappa and otter mythological imagery, is personal and human. It’s about exploring the ways we connect with those around us and what those connections mean. It’s a great follow-up for fans who watched , when it hit Netflix and are ,. But despite how weird it can get with all the kappa butt stuff, anyone could enjoy this show. It’ll likely be talked about for years to come, not just for the writing, but for the animation as well.,Early on, , feels like it’s writing a check it has no chance of being able to cash. It seems unlikely we’ll get any significant character development for the 10 different main characters, and their transition from not even amateur runners to one of the top college-marathon teams in Japan seems like it would be fantastical at worst and dubious at best.,Yet, over the course of its 23 episodes, the series presents a convincing story by being less about the sport than about these college students figuring out their lives in the present and future. The running acts as a constant that forces them all to interact, confronting issues in their lives while coming together as a group. This all climaxes in the show’s final episodes: as they run their section of a competitive two-day relay, they reflect on everything that’s happened. The ending only works because of how much the audience knows and cares about the characters, having seen so much of what they’ve gone through.,’s anime adaption is incredibly faithful, but it’s also a fascinating interpretation of the source material about the oldest kids at a secluded orphanage learning that they are actually being raised as food for demons. The manga is fundamentally more of a thriller, while the anime takes on a more horror-like quality. It’s not because they changed anything in the text of the work; it’s because of the way , Mamoru Kanbe visually approached it. Conversations as the kids secretly plan or try to work out what new information they have, are shot in an almost voyeuristic fashion, like the camera is spying on them from around a dark corner. The style adds to the creeping dread of these scenes in a way that isn’t found in the manga.,Even with all that, Emma, who is effectively the lead protagonist, is a breath of fresh air. She exudes a caring and optimism that serve as the driving force for keeping the characters moving forward, while affecting the way they think about approaching problems. She’s never presented as too naïve or not smart enough to understand her dire situation, though, which keeps the show from getting too dark or despairing to enjoy.,initially looks like it’s going to be a wish-fulfillment power fantasy. It’s about a middle-aged Tokyo man who dies while protecting his co-worker from being stabbed. But before completely dying, he awakens in a fantasy world as a low-level slime monster in a cave. Thanks to some strange abilities given to him as part of his transference to this fantasy world, he’s able to absorb items and creatures, allowing him to use and combine their abilities. After befriending a powerful dragon and receiving its blessing, he sets out to learn more about the new world he’s a part of.,The subsequent story could just be about him using his cool new powers in a fantasy world to get everything he ever wanted. Instead, the show is full of empathy. Rimuru is incredibly overpowered, but they understand that while they are possibly indestructible, others aren’t. So they end up using that power like a well-meaning middle manager, knowing how to delegate, and when and how to correctly protect and support others. This all adds a charm to the show, as the drama and story becomes less about Rimuru and more about those around them., has the intensity and mind games of ,, except it’s a bizarre rom-com about two people who like each other and are trying to get the other one to admit it first. Kaguya is vice president of the student council at a prestigious private school and heiress of a rich and powerful family. Student council president Miyuki is from a less auspicious family but is one of the most popular students at school. ,The concept is an interesting twist on a high school rom-com, but that alone isn’t enough to put it on this list. The show’s animation adds so much to the tension and emotional stakes of each scene, with incredibly stylized shots and exceptionally well-animated moments. These shots often elevate the absurdity of the dramatic confrontations, which are comedically great when you remember how trivially stupid the stakes are here, with both characters scheming to get the other person to ask them out. This isn’t a will they / won’t they show. It seems obvious that they’ll eventually come together. It’s just about watching the bizarre antics as these two would-be lovers stumble over their pride.,From the previews, , gives every indication that it’s going to be a cute show about a guy who adopts a cat. Instead, it’s a humorous, heartfelt show about social anxiety, trauma, and depression. It doesn’t just explore this through the secluded author Subaru, who’s dealing with the sudden death of his parents; it explores the same things with Haru the cat, who has her own issues from trying to take care of her siblings when they were abandoned.,The series shows almost everything from both Subaru and Haru’s perspectives, which helps contextualize Haru’s reactions to what Sabaru sees her do. Mainly, it shows how the growing connection between the two helps them find a better balance in their lives where their issues aren’t a constant impediment. It’s not a flashy show with amazing animation, but it tells a poignant story about mental health with the right amount of humor.,Where to start in talking about , It’s such an odd combination of action, body horror, fashion, and meta-referential musician references. For fans who’ve watched the series since part 1, it might all seem pretty normal now. But coming into this latest series fresh could be jarring. Still, this season, the fifth part of the series, works as a standalone piece since it’s narratively separate from the previous chapters. , turns the show into a story about internal strife in an Italian mafia full of people with ridiculous psychic abilities.,The series is ostensibly built on putting its characters in incredibly melodramatic and increasingly ridiculous situations. For instance, the main crew gets stuck on a train with someone who is trying to kill them with his ability to make people age quickly in enclosed spaces. So they hide in a living room created by a psychic turtle inside its shell. , makes the characters so appealing that wondering how they’ll get out of these situations matters more than the completely incomprehensible nature of their problems., manages to really distill this aspect of the series by offering up a small crew of people the viewers really want to root for. They’re gangsters, but their camaraderie and backstories, which reveal how they came to be so close, make them engaging. So does the constant danger they experience, especially since they usually don’t make it out unscathed. The audience’s constant concern for their safety feels justified. It isn’t just manipulative melodrama without consequences.",hundreds of new anime series come out every year so it can be difficult to pick out which ones are actually worth watching with each new

high school rom com but that alone isn t enough to put it on this list the show s animation adds so much to the tension and emotional stakes of each scene with incredibly stylized shots and exceptionally well animated moments these shots often elevate the absurdity of the dramatic confrontations which are comedically great when you remember how trivially stupid the stakes are here with both characters scheming to get the other person to ask them out this isn t a will they won t they show it seems obvious that they ll eventually come together it s just about watching the bizarre antics as these two would be lovers stumble over their pride from the previews gives every indication that it s going to be a cute show about a guy who adopts a cat instead it s a humorous heartfelt show about social anxiety trauma and depression it doesn t just explore this through the secluded author subaru who s dealing with the sudden death of his parents it explores the same things with haru the cat who has her own issues from trying to take care of her siblings when they were abandoned the series shows almost everything from both subaru and haru s perspectives which helps contextualize haru s reactions to what sabaru sees her do mainly it shows how the growing connection between the two helps them find a better balance in their lives where their issues aren t a constant impediment it s not a flashy show with amazing animation but it tells a poignant story about mental health with the right amount of humor where to start in talking about it s such an odd combination of action body horror fashion and meta referential musician references for fans who ve watched the series since part it might all seem pretty normal now but coming into this latest series fresh could be jarring still this season the fifth part of the series works as a standalone piece since it s narratively separate from the previous chapters turns the show into a story about internal strife in an italian mafia full of people with ridiculous psychic abilities the series is ostensibly built on putting its characters in incredibly melodramatic and increasingly ridiculous situations for instance the main crew gets stuck on a train with someone who is trying to kill them with his ability to make people age quickly in enclosed spaces so they hide in a living room created by a psychic turtle inside its shell makes the characters so appealing that wondering how they ll get out of these situations matters more than the completely incomprehensible nature of their problems manages to really distill this aspect of the series by offering up a small crew of people the viewers really want to root for they re gangsters but their camaraderie and backstories which reveal how they came to be so close make them engaging so does the constant danger they experience especially since they usually don t make it out unscathed the audience s constant concern for their safety feels justified it isn t just

111,Little America has small ideas about the immigrant experience,2020-01-28,Joshua Rivera,"According to its ,, , is “an anthology of funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring, and surprising stories about the lives of immigrants in the United States.” Its first season, released this month on the streaming service, is a collection of eight half-hour stories about immigrants who are trying to make it in the US. It’s the best show Apple has produced so far, but it’s also the most misguided. ,It almost hurts, considering the talent behind ,. Created by Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Lee Eisenberg, just about every episode is an excellent half-hour of television. Each actor on-screen is wonderful to watch, warm and likable at all times. The array of brown faces in front of and behind the camera is dazzling: Uchenna “Conphidance” Echeazu, Eshan Inamdar, Kemiyondo Coutinho, and Tze Chun are actors and filmmakers from a wide variety of backgrounds. The stories they tell (all based on real life) stop just shy of being saccharine.,The trouble is the framing. Like many immigrant stories, they are about overcoming or confronting nigh-insurmountable hardships. In “The Manager,” protagonist Kabir is 12 years old when his parents are deported, and he must take over the family motel, raising himself and running a business while writing obsessively to the government about his parents being readmitted into the country. He will not see them in person again until he is an adult.  In “The Son,” a gay Syrian man flees his family who reacted violently to discovering his orientation, crossing the border into Jordan in the hopes that he can one day claim asylum in the United States. “The Rock” is about an Iranian father who wants to purchase a home in the US but cannot afford it. Instead, he buys a plot of land with a massive, unremovable rock on it and commits to removing it, one chunk at a time. The house is never built.,Because , positions these stories as “inspiring,” it’s worth thinking about why. ,The idea is that we do not see these people represented very often — people who, in the real world, suffer all manner of prejudice and setbacks because they have dared to live a life in a country that is not made for them, even as it postures as the land of opportunity. ,, and works like it, exist as an act of empathy: look at these people. They just want the same simple things you do. A home, a business, a job, love. There are so many shades to the same story. ,But the exceptional nature of ,’s subjects plays into the idea that immigrants must earn our empathy, earn the right to be in the US, earn the mere chance to find happiness. In the US, stories like these are treated like a guidebook for citizenship if you’re a person of color and “inspiring” fodder for white people who want to believe themselves tolerant.,In another, more equitable pop culture landscape, maybe ,would land better. There is room for stories like these, and it bears repeating: it’s pretty good television! What hurts the series most is its frequent refusal to acknowledge that there are , its characters struggle with such hardship. In ,, coming to the United States to make a life is just ,, and the reasons are irrelevant — when, in fact, they are vital. ,The episodes that rise above this are the ones that show , each character faces the plight they do. “The Son” makes it immediately clear why a gay man must flee his Syrian family. In “The Grand Prize Expo Winners,” a Chinese woman wins a cruise for herself and her children. During their time at sea, her dreams of the American life she has obtained and the dreams her children have after being raised in the US come into quiet conflict. The bittersweet nature of the immigrant experience is made tangible for half an hour. ,These episodes are the exceptions. A good second season of , (which is already on the way) would follow their lead. A better one would ditch our cultural fixation on immigrant struggle porn entirely. ,There is dignity in being unremarkable. A noble life can be lived by those who are not paragons, by people getting by on wages too small in homes that do not fit their families in less-than-desirable neighborhoods. , wants its audience to regard immigrants as fully realized people.

113,"Roku is losing Fox apps just in time for you to miss the Super Bowl, maybe",2020-01-30,Sean Hollister,"If you were hoping to watch the Super Bowl on your Roku TV or set-top box, I hope you weren’t counting on streaming it through Fox’s apps — Roku is pulling all its Fox apps off of the platform, effective Friday, two days before the Big Game.,That might strike you as sudden, considering , that Fox Sports was working hard to bring a 4K HDR stream of the Super Bowl to Roku’s streaming sticks, pucks, and TVs. But minutes ago, Fox Sports removed references to Roku from multiple spots on its Super Bowl website, and we’ve now confirmed with Roku that seven channels in total are leaving... unless Fox and Roku strike a deal.,You see, this isn’t an arbitrary move, or even a technical issue — it’s a carriage dispute between the two companies, Roku tells ,Roku and Fox have a distribution agreement set to expire tomorrow. “We offered Fox an extension... if an agreement is not reached, we’ll be forced to remove the channels,” a company representative says. ,Here’s Fox’s statement, which clearly shows how heated this situation is:,Roku told us that it would be “forced to remove the channels” if an agreement is not reached, but Fox says that’s false; it’s entirely Roku’s decision. Roku declined to answer whether there’s actual contractual language that forces them to remove the channels.,Either way, these are the seven Fox channels that are disappearing, according to Roku:,Note that even if you still have these Fox apps on your Roku, the company says they won’t work anymore starting Friday. ,But there are other ways to stream. “The game will stream free on the NFL app on Roku unless Fox blocks your ability to stream it,” reads ,. And if you’ve got Comcast Xfinity or Spectrum, those Roku apps should also offer a Fox stream. Alternatively, you can sign up for FuboTV, YouTube TV, Sling TV, or Hulu with Live TV, a number of which have free trials if you haven’t previously been a subscriber. A rep says FuboTV may even offer a 4K stream.,But there’s a very good chance you can’t count on Fox’s own Roku apps to bring you the Super Bowl on Sunday, since Fox and Roku are playing hardball.,That may be a surprise to some Roku owners, since this is all that Roku is currently telling them via email — no mention of the game:,We’ll have to wait and see.

116,"New trailers: Fast & Furious 9, Swallow, and more",2020-02-01,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I finally got to see , the other week since I am, temporarily at least, a Hulu subscriber again, and that’s where it’s currently streaming. It’s a great movie with a tough political viewpoint that feels all its own, at least among (arguably) mainstream films. It’s all the more impressive considering that it’s the debut feature from Boots Riley.,One thing I particularly appreciated was, after the fact, getting to read some of Riley’s writing offering insight into how he saw his characters and why his movie was crafted the way it was.
