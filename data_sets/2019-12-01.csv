129,Runaways finally figures out the show it wants to be — right before it ends ,2019-12-13,Joshua Rivera," could’ve been great. The show’s basic premise, about a group of teens who discover that their parents are all supervillains and run away to fight them, is beautifully on the nose. Teenagers rebelling against parents who are actually evil! Also, there are superpowers and a pet dinosaur? If no one else tries it, ,will. ,Unfortunately, ,, Hulu’s TV series based on the Marvel comic created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, stumbled with the execution almost immediately. Its first two seasons were oddly paced and imbalanced, sapping all momentum from the show by decisions that didn’t end up working out so well — first in choosing to slow down the story so that the eponymous Runaways don’t actually, well, run away until the first season finale, and then in choosing to focus on their parents just as much. (Parents are boring, everyone knows that.),In its third and final 10-episode season, out today, ,goes for broke and resets everything — but slowly. The first half of the season is dedicated to tying up the majority of plot threads introduced over the last two years. The second half barrels headfirst into something new: the show it always should have been. ,It’s a lot like watching the show clean up its own act before it goes off to a bright future in college, one episode at a time. The last season left the cast — teen polymath Alex Wilder, power-goth Nico Minoru, reformed jock Chase Stein, dinosaur owner / intersectional feminist Gertrude Yorkes, super-strong kid sister Molly Hayes, and secret alien Karolina Dean — split up and pretty much beat. Their parents, formerly members of an evil cult of alien worshippers, now possessed by the even-more-evil aliens they worshipped, have captured half the team and imprisoned them in a low-budget version of the Matrix. It’s all part of a scheme to open up a portal to another world and, well, you know what? The show doesn’t really care. ,I can’t stress enough how strange and funny it is to watch ,completely change its mind about its direction mid-season, as its cast gets whisked away to another dimension in order to give the show a hard reset. In a way, it’s remarkable. It’s incredibly rare to see a show address and internalize a critical dressing-down and make a hard pivot for the better, but that’s what ,does. ,The parents and their cult-related schemes are almost entirely dispensed with, only brought back when it makes sense. With their reduced presence, the teens actually get to indulge in some teen drama and weird comic-book-y shenanigans involving alternate dimensions, teen covens, and double-crossing. One of the most frustrating character changes, rewriting Nico Minoru’s character from the teen witch of the comics to someone who just owns an alien staff, is completely retconned. She’s a witch now. Magic is now a confirmed thing on the show. ,It’s so much of a thing, in fact, that the final villain of the season is Morgan le Fay, the sorceress of Arthurian legend (and also a Marvel comics character). Also making appearances are Ty Johnson and Tandy Bowen, the light- and darkness-powered heroes of Marvel’s other doomed-too-soon teen show on Freeform, ,. , final season is a bittersweet watch. For years, the comic it was based on was one of the best points of entry for comic books, more interested in believable characters and fun pacing than any of the normal trappings of superheroics. Its TV adaptation could have been just as refreshing, but too often, it looked like a pale, confused imitation. ,At the very least, it gets to go out with a bang.", could ve been great the show s

131,The Lost finale was the decade’s most underrated ending,2019-12-17,Jay Peters," series finale, “The End,” is my favorite finale of any TV show — but not because it solved all of the show’s many mysteries. It didn’t., was ABC’s smash hit about the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 and the island where they crashed. The show was great at character-driven stories and showing how the island (generally) turned them all into better people, but it did so in an exciting way by making those stories play out among the many mysteries, questions, and curiosities of the island.,Throughout six seasons of these dangling questions, I — like many other fans — was ready for answers. But by the time of the finale, it was becoming clear that we weren’t going to get the mind-melting revelations we were hoping for. , represented, among other things, candidates to replace an immortal being that ruled the island? Hmm. The smoke monster was made when that being threw his brother into a magical cave of light? Uh, okay.,And in the finale, we finally learned that the island kept its mystical energy because... a plug in a pool kept the island’s magical water from draining away. Following season after season of increasingly clever answers to increasingly clever mysteries, seeing the banal reality of a giant drain stopper was something of a letdown.,But I loved the finale anyway. Instead of checking off every box, executive producers Carlton Cuse (who has since created , and Amazon’s , series) and Damon Lindelof (, and HBO’s ,) instead packed the finale with as many unforgettable character-driven moments as they could. And that, in retrospect, is what the show was , the best at the whole time, anyway. Who can forget iconic moments like “,,” the reveal of the show’s ,, and ,?,Ironically enough, the finale made its character moments really shine by paying off , mystery in a huge way. Season 6 played with , trope of flashbacks or flash-forwards by instead presenting flash-,a weird alternate reality where Oceanic Flight 815 didn’t crash. In the flash-sideways, the characters apparently have no knowledge of their connections on the island. The audience doesn’t know what the point of the flash-sideways was — until they reach the series finale. By that time, the audience knows that the show’s characters can “wake up” from the flash-sideways and suddenly recollect their lives on the island.,These sepia-toned recollections are powerful flashes of each character’s most memorable plots throughout the entire show, usually with their one true love, and each is backed by the very best of Michael Giacchino’s amazing soundtrack. The finale gives us ,: , how they rekindled their relationship and eventually died together. , how they fell in love. , their amazing, wonderful, best-ever relationship. ,These moments of recollection in the finale were beautiful when I first watched the final episode live in May 2010. But when I recently rewatched the episode, sitting next to the person I would marry six days later, these scenes , me. I cried at every single one.,I’ve come to realize that the point of the finale, and perhaps all of ,, wasn’t to get answers to the plot questions that got many of us to care about the show in the first place. (That is something I also think is true about most of the recent enduring prestige TV dramas, including ,, ,, and, yes, even ,.) The point was to deliberately show that the real journey, and I mean this with no irony, was the friends the characters made along the way — and maybe that’s what the journeys of our real lives are,

132,"No matter how Watchmen ends, it’s already done more than enough",2019-12-14,Joshua Rivera,"It was the Rorschach mask in the glove box that sold me. ,, HBO’s sequel / reinvention of the comic of the same name by Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore, came out the gate swinging with a prologue set during the 1921 Tulsa race riot. But it was the next scene that got me fully on board, one that showed that Rorschach, the original comic’s most popular character, was a hero to white supremacists. It felt transgressive but also right — and then I flipped back to the comic and you know what? It ,right. The TV , sold me on its relevance by resurfacing something incredibly obvious about its source material that years of fan culture had scrubbed away, mostly because the character looked cool. ,There’s an understandable urge to laud popular culture that ,, to credit shows or movies that address injustices or give a platform to the marginalized.

So it’s important to note that, while , is definitely one of this year’s best shows for the provocative way it centers race in a way that both mainstream entertainment and pundits often do not, it’s also incredible for being fun as hell. There’s time travel, killer action, a deep conspiracy, and a great love story. There’s a lot there — maybe too much to end well. And you know what? If it doesn’t, that’s fine.,In 2019, , (the comic) was arguably more trouble than it’s worth. As a work of comics, it’s as good as everyone says, a rich reading experience that’s held up for decades. As a cultural touchstone, however, it’s been a disaster, inspiring a whole generation of creators and fans who were more fascinated in its “realistic” take on superheroes than its pervasive ideas about a world marching toward its own annihilation, and the cultural attitudes that brought it to the brink of doomsday. ,One way to measure the success of HBO’s , has been how satisfying it is to watch the show completely rewrite its source material, trading its anxieties for current ones, taking its criticisms of superhero fiction and extending it further to make it a criticism of power and the whiteness of that power. In this new ,, superheroes aren’t just the purview of thrill-seekers and proto-fascists. They’re how white supremacy digs its roots deeper into the culture: not just by seizing power, but also by seizing our fantasies.

It corrected its fictional history the way we have begun to correct our real one, re-centering the main thrust of its stories on the people of color previously ignored. Hooded Justice, the first superhero, is not the white man historians assumed he was, but a black hero born from the trauma of the Tulsa race riot and refused justice at every turn by the racist country he tried to serve, first in war, and then with a badge. Doctor Manhattan, the godlike superhuman, is reinvented under the guise of Cal Abar, a black man living in Oklahoma. The villain of the show is a folksy white senator, friendly and seemingly well-intentioned, secretly leading a cabal of racists who want to help him steal the powers of a god, simply because he feels entitled to take them. ,The ,comics are celebrated because they challenged popular notions about superheroes and comics, changing our perceptions of what they could be.

133,"New trailers: Wonder Woman 1984, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, In the Heights, and more",2019-12-14,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I recently saw ,, Edward Norton’s adaptation of the two-decade-old Jonathan Lethem novel about a private investigator with Tourette syndrome. I’ve never read the book, but from what I gather, the movie is an almost complete departure from the text outside of its core conceit.,Departing from the book isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Norton’s instinct to play up the noir elements makes for a fun, slapstick twist on the genre at points, and 1950s New York is a lot of fun to explore.,But the movie also feels a little hollowed out. Norton basically jams a tour through , (the famously thorough 1975 biography of Robert Moses, which has nothing to do with ,) into the core of his adaptation, without much to say about it. It’s great historical drama, but it’s mostly used here to give the characters something cool to see and do. That story deserves a whole lot more attention than what it’s given.,Check out eight trailers from this week below.,The first trailer for , came out this week, and it’s really all about highlighting how stylized and 1980s this thing is going to be. Seriously, I have almost no idea of what’s happening in the movie after watching this — this trailer is all about the vibe, and it looks like a lot of fun. The film comes out June 5th.,So listen, this looks like a perfectly nice movie. But I’m completely puzzled why this is what we’re getting after all the ridiculous hubbub over the last ,.

It feels like the , of ,, ushering a new generation into a huge dramatic story. Except , is not a huge dramatic story, it’s a silly comedy! What is happening here?

It comes out June 26th.,Emerald Fennell, who took over as ,’s head writer in season 2, is coming out with her debut feature film next year. , taps into some of those same tones for a scary drama about revenge, which has Carey Mulligan playing a woman who, in seemingly a variety of twisted ways, takes down would-be rapists. It comes out April 17th.,Netflix’s adaptation of , arrives at the end of the month, when we’ll find out just how much of an epic, ,-eseque event the streaming service can turn it into. At the very least, the show looks like it’s bound to be visually impressive with the budget to do things on an appropriately huge scale. It comes out December 20th.,There are two types of , seasons: ones where Larry obnoxiously breaks social norms and we watch the fallout, and ones where Larry bumps up against norms in unexpected ways, highlighting just how weird they can be. I really think only one of these, the latter, makes for good seasons of the show — and there have been some excellent seasons. But I thought season 9 went too far in the “obnoxious Larry” direction, and it seems like season 10 is headed that way, too. I hope not, because , can be such a fun show to watch when it’s at its best. The new season starts January 19th.,I didn’t include an earlier trailer for , because the movie seems to be hitting a lot of very familiar horror beats. But you know, it seems to be doing a good job of it, too. The movie looks quiet and creepy, and who doesn’t love seeing a pained Jesse Plemons say something that he obviously knows more about than he’s letting on. The movie comes out April 17th.,I didn’t think this was a real movie when I first started seeing trailers floating around for it, because it just seems so much like a weird little joke Ryan Reynolds would make. But no... this is a movie. A real, complete movie about, basically, an NPC in a video game who becomes a real player, or something like that. The premise is strange and a little nonsensical. The entire thing is weird, really. I’m mostly sharing this out of morbid fascination. It’s coming to theaters? I don’t believe it.

and it looks like a lot of fun the film comes out june th so listen this looks like a perfectly nice movie but i m completely puzzled why this is what we re getting after all the ridiculous hubbub over the last the last movie from what i could tell felt much like the original four people in new york in a ludicrous comedy this new movie is weirdly serious it feels like the of ushering a new generation into a huge dramatic story except is not a huge dramatic story it s a silly comedy what is happening here it comes out july th i m not a huge fan of musicals but even i have to admit this looks like a lot of fun is an adaptation of lin manuel miranda s first broadway play and it s directed by jon m chu who was recently behind a small romcom you may have heard of it comes out june th emerald fennell who took over as s head writer in season is coming out with her debut feature film next year taps into some of those same tones for a scary drama about revenge which has carey mulligan playing a woman who in seemingly a variety of twisted ways takes down would be rapists it comes out april th netflix s adaptation of arrives at the end of the month when we ll find out just how much of an epic eseque event the streaming service can turn it into at the very least the show looks like it s bound to be visually impressive with the budget to do things on an appropriately huge scale it comes out december th there are two types of seasons ones where larry obnoxiously breaks social norms and we watch the fallout and ones where larry bumps up against norms in unexpected ways highlighting just how weird they can be i really think only one of these the latter makes for good seasons of the show and there have been some excellent seasons but i thought season went too far in the obnoxious larry direction and it seems like season is headed that way too i hope not because can be such a fun show to watch when it s at its best the new season starts january th i didn t include an earlier trailer for because the movie seems to be hitting a lot of very familiar horror beats but you know it seems to be doing a good job of it too the movie looks quiet and creepy and who doesn t love seeing a pained jesse plemons say something that he obviously knows more about than he s letting on the movie comes out april th i didn t think this was a real movie when i first started seeing trailers floating around for it because it just seems so much like a weird little joke ryan reynolds would make but no this is a movie a real complete movie about basically an npc in a video game who becomes a real player or something like that the premise is strange and a little nonsensical the entire thing is weird really i m mostly sharing this out of morbid fascination it s coming to theaters

135,"Netflix’s stalker thriller You returns for a second season, and it kills",2019-12-23,Joshua Rivera,"Perhaps the most deliciously satisfying thing about ,is that it began as a Lifetime show. It seemed to fit right in, too — based on the novel of the same name by Caroline Kepnes, the show followed bookseller Joe Goldberg as he began to stalk a woman named Beck, gradually inserting himself more and more into her life as he attempted to woo her and isolate her from all her friends. You know. Lifetime stuff. ,After a killer-but-little-watched first season, the show migrated to Netflix, where it will maybe find the audience it deserves — and yes, it does deserve it. Because ,masquerades as trashy thriller in order to get you to underestimate it — dismiss it, even — while it goes to work subverting every assumption you had about it. It’s a trick that doesn’t seem repeatable, but in ,’s second season, out December 26th, the show somehow pulls it off.,The second season of , is a bit of a reset. ,’s first season was fairly conclusive (I’ll be vague to preserve the fun for those who haven’t seen it), so in its second season, Joe — trying to start over after the first season’s events in New York — moves to LA, a place he hates, but also a place no one knows him. ,After briefly entertaining the notion of being a changed man who has left his stalking ways behind, Joe quickly falls into his old patterns. This time, his obsession is a woman named Love, his coworker at the hybrid wellness store / bookshop Anavrin. (Spell it backward and groan with me.),At first, it seems like , is simply repeating itself, playing the same beats with a different woman in Joe’s sights. To a certain extent, that’s true — there’s even a running subplot about a troubled woman who lives next door with a plucky kid Joe becomes protective of, a mirror image of season 1 — but as the twists pile up, the reflection comes across as intentional and effective. And it’s not like there aren’t new things happening here. Love’s codependent relationship with her brother takes , into some unexpected places, and the show’s new setting gives it new arenas for exploring toxic masculinity. There’s also some leftover threads from last season that turn the pressure up. And finally, harkening back to a similar moment in season 1, when the show finally breaks free of Joe’s perspective to let the audience in on Love’s side of the story, things , take a turn. ,What makes , subversive, brilliant television is delightfully simple: Joe is an idiot. Sure, he reads a lot of books and, as an observer of people, is pretty deft at manipulating the fundamental selfishness of others. But as a criminal? He’s hilariously incompetent. This is where , twists the knife you never knew it slipped in, because the point of the show is that he doesn’t , to be good at any of this. , makes it easy to condemn Joe because we are privy to his private moments and thoughts, the ways he justifies every overreach and horrible action. But to everyone else? He’s just a man, standing in front of a girl, patiently waiting for her to love him. He benefits from decades of cultural attitudes that have worn away at the agency of women, of romance tropes that valorize the persistence of men in pursuit of a woman, and the gendered head games that give men the upper hand in most every interaction they have. ,It does all this while also being extremely fun pulp nonsense, which somehow makes it feel ,dangerous. Throughout it all, Joe Goldberg is… funny? Sharp? And, thanks to Penn Badgley, perhaps the best voiceover narrator you’ve ever heard? You , Joe, and, because of a combination of Badgley’s performance and the incredible savvy of every member of the crew that points a camera or light at him, you frequently suffer whiplash for liking him, as he goes from charming book nerd to sardonic lead to super creep in the same shot. ,What we call prestige television is often a function of marketing. Prestige shows — the kind of stuff you see on HBO and sweeping the Emmys — involves a lot of putting on airs, signaling an intent to be literary or ambitious. , does no such thing. It is every inch the Lifetime show it began as, and just as wickedly sharp or thoughtful as another show with loftier goals. This makes , feel dangerous. Like it shouldn’t work so well.

136,"Netflix’s The Witcher is a dark, funny, and faithful adaptation of the fantasy series",2019-12-20,Andrew Webster,"You learn nearly everything you need to know about , hero Geralt (Henry Cavill) a few minutes into the first episode. The titular witcher — a work-for-hire monster hunter with some helpful superpowers — is first seen in a swamp, nearly killed by a giant spider monster, beaten and almost drowned. In the next scene, Geralt heads to a local pub for information on his next quest, only to be subjected to ridicule and scorn from villagers who are scared of his supernatural nature. Ultimately, he’s saved from a barroom brawl thanks to a helpful young woman, who very quickly becomes a romantic partner.,The Netflix adaptation captures the enigmatic hero perfectly. He’s struggling to survive in a world that hates him, stubbornly sticking to a moral code that forces him into dangerous  situations. He’s gruff and sarcastic, always down for a fight, impossibly charming, and frequently irresistible. It’s a premise that worked well in book and video game form — and now it’s one of the best series on Netflix., is based on a series of fantasy novels from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which reached a new level of global popularity thanks to a series of video games. ,, in particular, propelled the franchise to blockbuster status. Every iteration follows Geralt, part of an ancient and dwindling line of monster hunters known as witchers. They’re mutated from a young age to be stronger and faster, and the process also gives them limited magical abilities and prolonged life spans. Geralt is a gunslinger type, moseying into a town in trouble, slaying the inevitable magical beast, collecting his pay, and moving on.,In this way, , is different than most fantasy stories, including obvious contemporaries like ,. It does have the elements of a vast epic tale — including plenty of political machinations and lots of warring kingdoms — but at its best, , is like a fantastical detective series, with Geralt investigating dangerous magical creatures and inevitably being pulled into much bigger conspiracies.,What makes the new show work so well is the way it seamlessly blends together these two types of storytelling. There , an interesting overarching story. In addition to Geralt, the show also follows Ciri, a young princess with mysterious powers who is on the run from a rival kingdom, and Yennefer, a fiercely independent sorceress with grand ambitions. Viewers follow along as their three paths inevitably intertwine. But instead of the serialized approach favored by prestige television, for much of its runtime , has more of a “creature of the week” structure. (This changes in the final two episodes as the season rushes towards a conclusion that very clearly sets up the second season.),Each episode — many of which are based explicitly on short stories from the books — tasks Geralt with solving a different monster-related problem, whether that’s a princess turned into a beast, or a vengeful djinn who has cursed his best friend, the bard Dandelion (who primarily goes by Jaskier in the show). The structure feels true to the spirit of the series, while also making it work well for television.,It also means that the show demands a bit more from viewers. Events in , don’t always unfold in chronological order, and there’s no explicit indication of whether you’re watching a scene in the past or present. Instead, you have to sort out the timing based on contextual clues: a line about an event you’ve already seen, or how close two characters have become. (Figuring out the timing isn’t helped by the fact that witchers and sorcerers barely age.) It took me a few episodes to get a solid sense of things. This also means , benefits from repeat viewings, where you can pick up on small details you may have missed the first time.,The most important part of ,, though, is Geralt himself. I’ll admit: I was nervous after seeing the initial photos of Henry Cavill in a Party City-esque white wig, but he absolutely nails the role. His Geralt is the exact right blend of scary, sexy, and sarcastic. Even his gravelly voice is perfect. The wig may look strange at times, but ultimately it doesn’t distract from what makes Geralt interesting. You even get to see him in multiple ,.,As a TV show, , is particularly refreshing in an era full of nihilistic fantasy stories inspired by ,. Yes, the show gets brutal at times. The wonderfully choreographed fight scenes are extremely violent, as is one very particular and hard-to-watch magical transformation. It’s a show where — shock! — the bad guys are usually humans, not monsters. What makes , feel different, though, is in the details. These stories aren’t full of people being awful for the sake of it; they’re making choices based on love or survival, and then things go wrong. What makes , so compelling is how it delves into these gray areas, exploring why people do what they do. By the end, you’ll have some measure of sympathy for almost everyone, no matter how irredeemable they might seem at first.,Crucially, , has a sense of humor. It’s not all dark and dire. Jaskier (Joey Batey) frequently plays the comedy relief, following Geralt around despite not being welcome, in order to turn Geralt’s exploits into song, sometimes breaking the fourth wall in the process. “There I go again,” he says at one point, “just delivering exposition.” When he meets the witcher for the first time, the bard tells him “I love the way you just sit in a corner and brood.” Meanwhile, Geralt’s quietly sarcastic nature is on full display. He can cut through any situation, no matter how awkward or horrible, with a frustrated “fuck.” And one of the show’s most dramatic sex scenes is accompanied by a playful jig and gawking onlookers making jokes.,could’ve very easily turned out wrong. It’s not hard to misinterpret what it is that actually makes the series interesting, but the TV adaptation gets it. ,is funny, intense, and uncomfortable, and it balances out those disparate emotions almost perfectly. Yes, it stars Henry Cavill in a bad white wig, but you’ll forget about all of that as soon as he starts talking.",you learn nearly everything you need to know about hero geralt henry cavill a few

138,"New trailers: Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, Top Gun: Maverick, and more",2019-12-21,Jacob Kastrenakes,"Alright everyone, it’s time for ,. I’m writing this before I’ve seen the new movie, so instead I’m going to write about ,, which I think did some very smart things to set up this film, even if it may have also made life a little trickier for J.J. in other ways, too.,The smartest thing , did for the trilogy was kill off Snoke — an empty plot device — and set up Kylo Ren as the ultimate villain. The absolutely palpable tension between Rey and Kylo (and more broadly, their shared battle between light and dark) gives the story a core worth caring about. The trilogy is all about these two people, even if, you know, the entire galaxy is at stake too. (Trailers suggest , brings in a new ultimate villain, and I question whether that’s the right decision.),What I think makes things trickier is how , ends. It’s fully open for Abrams to take where he’d like. That may be quite freeing, but it also means that — despite being eight films into a nine film saga — there’s no obvious next step, let alone an end point beyond the good guys winning this round. Abrams keeps talking about tying up eight films’ worth of plot, but the problem is, that’s not really true. It’s mostly just been film after film, without a clear trajectory. I think that’s part of the fun of these movies, but it also makes for difficult endings when so much of the framework has to be established within the final movie.,Check out 11 trailers from this week below.,(P.S. I’m off for the holidays next week, but I’ll see you all again in 2020!),Here’s the latest from Christopher Nolan. ,, which he wrote and directed, appears to be  a time-bending action thriller that has its heroes trying to stop a bad guy or something (IDK they mention World War III and nukes) while other characters are going backward in time in front of them. The visual effect is very trippy and a little weird to watch, but I imagine it’ll make for a cool premise. The film comes out July 17th. (I must note, I’m not sure I’ve seen a trailer before that ends with the message: “SEE THE TRAILER IN THEATERS FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT.” What effect? What? Vision? It’s just bigger!),I didn’t realize this when the first trailer for , came out: the entire film is presented as if it were a single unbroken shot. Long takes are an effect that can easily be misused, but I get the impression that it makes a lot of sense here — the film is about two soldiers racing across France to deliver an urgent message about an impending ambush, and the unbroken shot should play up the impact of that ticking clock. It comes out January 10th.,I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a trailer quite like this. The new trailer for , is basically just a triumphant dose of nostalgia — two minutes of ,Top Gun,? — without actually getting into the substance of the movie at all. But I guess substance doesn’t matter here. It’s Tom Cruise. It’s ,. We know what we’re gonna get. It comes out June 26th.,The latest from my boy Joe Wright (director of the 2005 ,) is a ,-style thriller that has a woman confined to her home trying to unravel a murder she believes she’s witnessed. Except, unlike ,, , seems to get increasingly strange as things go on, with the mystery folding back on her. It comes out May 15th.,Here’s the latest trailer for ,, Pixar’s fantasy twist on a road movie. Despite the cute mashup, the premise and world somehow still feel familiar, and it’s kind of tempering my interest. The movie looks like an entirely pleasant and fun trip, but I’m just not sure it’ll be any more than that. The film comes out March 6th. ,Written and directed by Eliza Hittman, , is about a teenage girl who travels from rural Pennsylvania to New York City to get an abortion, where consent of a parent isn’t required. The movie looks absolutely devastating, filmed like a quiet, awkward, uncomfortable indie, but with a powerful coming of age story underneath. It comes out March 13th.,Apple’s next TV show is an anthology series with Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon serving as executive producers. Each episode features a story about a person or family trying to move to or otherwise make it in America. That seems like a somewhat tricky thing to build an audience around given the constantly rotating cast, but it’s also the kind of heartwarming content Apple seems determined to build its brand on. The stories are based on pieces in , — which, full disclosure, shares the same parent company as ,. The show comes out January 17th., has Zoey Deutch playing an absurdly high-energy hustler who seems to have no ethics and will stop at nothing to make money and get out of her home town. Early festival reviews have been good so far, and the movie looks enjoyable raucous from this trailer. It comes out on Valentine’s Day.,John Mulaney made this wonderfully offbeat looking comedy special that is ostensibly a children’s show but in reality seems to be a wacky variety special filled with songs and visuals and guest stars, including David Byrne, Jake Gyllenhaal, and quite a few more. It comes out December 24th on Netflix.,Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus star in this remake of ,, a 2014 Swedish comedy that earned rave reviews when it came out. I never saw the original, so I’m not sure how well they’ve been able to translate the humor (the original film’s director is on board as an executive producer).

139,Galavant was the decade’s most underrated show that no one watched,2019-12-18,Chaim Gartenberg,"“,” ,So begins the tale of ,, , that ran in 2015 and (somehow) returned for an even longer second season the following year.,On the surface, it’s a generic send-off of the fantasy genre that plays like a watered down version of , (with a little less heart and a little more snark). But , has a trick up its sleeve — it’s also a musical, a song-and-dance affair like a live-action Disney movie of old. , like a Disney movie, in fact, given that the songs were all written by the legendary Alan Menken (,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,) and co-collaborator Glenn Slater. ,The show starts by setting up a classic fairy-tale story in its , — Galavant is a gallant knight, riding to save his beloved Madalena from the clutches wicked King Richard — and then promptly blows the entire premise to bits. ,What follows are a few hours of fantasy-fueled musical comedy. There are jousts. There are sword fights. There are a variety of guest cameos. And of course, there are lot of enjoyable tunes, which range from clever to impossible to get out of your head. ,The cast is great, too: Joshua Sasse plays the titular hero, given equal opportunities to flex his golden pipes and biceps; Karen David is the iron-willed Princess Isabella, and Mallory Jansen is Galavant’s trope-dodging lost love Madalena. But the standout is Timothy Omundson’s King Richard, the initial antagonist who steals the show as a blustering, bumbling dictator with a heart of gold (and a truly magnificent beard). It helps that nearly all of the main cast can actually sing well, which means that there’s less of the awkwardness and auto-tuning typical of a Very Special Musical Episode from most shows. ,It’s not deep, but it’s deeply fun, especially if you (like me) particularly enjoy Disney renaissance movies and stage musicals. Thanks to its very unpopular nature, , is also extremely short, the kind of thing you can easily binge on a weekend when it’s too cold to go outside. To say that almost no one watched the first season of the show is an understatement — it was one of ABC’s worst shows that year — and despite a cliffhanger ending, it seemed like , was doomed to be nothing more than an easily missed blip on ABC’s schedule. ,Except, for some reason, it wasn’t. ABC gave the show a “miracle” renewal for a second season, and , delivered one of the most satisfying sequels of the decade. Season 2 takes everything further: more songs, more episodes, more off-kilter fairy-tale wackiness. The first episode, titled “A New Season ... aka Suck It Cancellation Bear” (a reference to ,) starts with a song that sees the , and features a shameless appeal to viewers to watch , instead of football, the Golden Globes, or , ,. The second season also adds more fantasy elements and specific parodies of stage musicals (including , and ,), as icing on the cake. ,ABC also took a page out the book of the far more popular ,, releasing songs individually on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube in the hopes that social media buzz might help lead to more success for the series. It also means that all the music is available to listen to, which you will mostly likely want to do after watching ,.  ,That the show even got renewed at all is a wild story. , was announced as part of ABC’s lineup in 2014, before being consigned to the mid-season break as filler for , Sunday night slot. (ABC had so little faith in the series that the eight-episode season was actually condensed into four weeks, with two episodes airing each Sunday). As expected, ratings were dismal, with the adorable musical comedy series being utterly crushed by ABC’s generally poor viewership, playoff football games, and award shows like the Golden Globes. A cancellation was all but guaranteed — except that ,was a favorite of then-ABC president Paul Lee, who ordered a second season against all odds (and against all common sense, if we’re being totally honest).,’s renewal — along with another season for the also poorly performing Marvel spinoff , — was part of Lee’s strategy to create “sticky” content that bet more on building brands with long-term cultural staying power over immediate rating success.

140,What to read and play after watching The Witcher on Netflix,2019-12-20,Andrew Webster,"So you’ve just finished watching Geralt grimace his way through eight episodes of ,. There’s a good chance you want more. Maybe it was the deep world-building that enticed you or all of the monster-hunting. Maybe it was Henry Cavill’s piercing yellow eyes. Either way, you’re in luck: you don’t have to wait for the second season to get more of Geralt. ,is based on a series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which also spawned a series of video games from CD Projekt Red so there is already a lot of , in the world to dive into. If you’re brand-new to the series, here are the best places to start.,The obvious place to start would be the very first , novel, ,, which,kicks off a lengthy storyline that spans six books. But if you’re coming to the books from the TV show, I’d recommend first delving into the short story collections, which predate the novels. There are two of them — , and ,— and both feature tales that form the basis for many of the show’s best episodes. The episode “Rare Species,” for instance, is based on the story “The Bounds of Reason” from ,, while the disturbing story “The Witcher” in , is the core of the episode “The Betrayer Moon.”,There are differences between the books and the show, of course. The Netflix series also weaves in an overarching story about warring kingdoms and the importance of destiny, which is largely absent from the short stories. But the two complement each other well, and they follow a similar structure, jumping back and forth in time with reckless abandon. In my opinion at least, , is at its best in this more standalone format, with Geralt investigating a new monster-related tragedy in each story. These two books will give you plenty of that.,You might be tempted to start from the beginning when it comes to the games. But I’d recommend sticking with the most recent entry in the series. Unlike books, games tend to age poorly, and this is particularly true for RPGs where quality-of-life updates can make older titles a chore to play through. But 2015’s , still feels fantastic today, and it’s the best — and most ambitious — entry in the series. It shifts things toward an open-world structure, and it’s filled with the same morally complex storytelling that makes the TV show so compelling. The two don’t cross over much, though; Netflix’s , is explicitly based on the books. And despite the three in the title, you don’t need to play the previous games to understand what’s going on.,Now is also the best time to play ,. For one thing, the game received two massive expansions, so if you’re just starting, you have , of video game in front of you. (The main story lasts dozens of hours on its own.) But it’s also very accessible. It’s available on a huge range of platforms, and it’s frequently on sale. Just yesterday, ,launched on Xbox Game Pass, making it free for subscribers to play. It’s even on the Nintendo Switch.

141,"From Fleabag to Killing Eve, Phoebe Waller-Bridge dominated TV in 2019",2019-12-27,Aliya Chaudhry,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge is having a great year. Fresh off the second season of her acclaimed show ,, the writer / actor / producer inked a blockbuster , in September. She’s emerged at the end of 2019 as one of the biggest names in TV, having worked on the script for the upcoming James Bond film, started on a brand-new HBO show, hosted Saturday Night Live, and won big at the Emmys for ,, in which Waller-Bridge plays the title character, is based on a play she wrote and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2013. Season 1 premiered in 2016, but the show practically went viral when the second season came out this summer. It was praised from start to finish for its brilliance and charm. The confessional, fourth-wall-breaking comedic drama centers on a woman navigating her life through personal relationships, crises, and tragedy, sandwiched between truly genius twists along the way. , isn’t just good writing and storytelling — it’s a show that resonates and connects with its audience. It can be painfully embarrassing at times, yet still irresistible to watch. And even at its most hyperbolic and cringeworthy moments, it still manages to feel real. It’s unflinching and fearless in its honesty and willingness to show Fleabag’s vulnerability. It’s funny, it’s heartbreaking, it’s layered, it’s raw, it’s genuine. ,One of Waller-Bridge’s big moments came during , where ,won for Outstanding Comedy Series, and Waller-Bridge won for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

144,The Mandalorian shows why Star Wars should be smaller ,2019-12-28,Joshua Rivera,"Two months ago, just before , was about to premiere on Disney+, I made a joke to some friends: wouldn’t it be funny if this show was better than ,? I thought it was unlikely, but possible: ending a trilogy well is hard, and , didn’t have nearly as many expectations riding on it. Eight weeks later and , is out, a very profitable ,, and , concludes its first season with a finale that doesn’t try for much, but also rocks. It is, surprisingly, the better Star War.,(Very mild spoilers to follow.),Most of the reasons why I like , boil down to restraint: It’s full of things most Star Wars movies , do. It doesn’t have a Jedi, or anyone who’s even , of the Force. It’s not about a Chosen One. It’s not even particularly concerned with its place in any grand narrative — sure, the show makes it easy to figure out that it’s set after , and there are a number of familiar , accoutrements. But its overall story? Very much doing its own thing. ,Let’s recap: The eponymous Mandalorian is a bounty hunter who takes a high-paying job for a former Imperial officer. That job turns out to be a child with special powers. He decides not to hand the child over to the definitely evil Imperial holdouts, and goes on the run. The stoic Mandalorian and the adorable baby have adventures, most of them aiming for you to say, “Hey, that’s cool” about two or three times per episode. ,I love how inconsequential , feels, especially since the , films have been about people doing Big Important Things involving the fate of the galaxy or whatever. It even ends with a reassertion of the status quo: Mando and The Child, out and about. What will they find next?,A big part of the , charm is the way that it feels like a world you can live in. And ,? It shows people just trying to get by, out in the galactic equivalent of a small midwestern farm town. Sure, the Empire has fallen and the New Republic is starting to get its feet (only to fall again by the time , rolls around) but none of that matters. Out here, they’re just trying to raise ugly lizards and gas up their spaceships so they can make it to the next job. ,Now that I’ve seen it, this is the , I want more of. Smaller stories, about smaller people, being noble or selfish in ways that ripple through their own communities, not the whole damn galaxy. It’s this implication at the heart of , that made that movie so compelling, and the diversions , made into the lives of Clone Troopers fascinating to watch. We come to ,for the big and spectacular, but we stay because it always left room for the small and intimate.",two months ago just before was about to premiere on disney i made a joke to some friends wouldn t it be funny if this show was better than i thought it was unlikely but possible ending a trilogy well is hard and didn t have nearly as many expectations riding on it eight weeks later and is out a very profitable and concludes its first season with a finale that doesn t try for much but also rocks it is surprisingly the better star war very mild spoilers to follow most of the reasons why i like boil down to restraint it s full of things most star wars movies do it doesn t have a jedi or anyone who s even of the force it s not about a chosen one it s not even particularly concerned with its place in any grand narrative sure the show makes it easy to figure out that it s set after and there are a number of familiar accoutrements but its overall story very much doing its own thing let s recap the eponymous mandalorian is a bounty hunter who takes a high paying job for a former imperial officer that job turns out to be a child with special powers he decides not to hand the child over to the definitely evil imperial holdouts and goes on the run the stoic mandalorian and the adorable baby have adventures most of them aiming for you to say hey that s cool about two or three times per episode i love how inconsequential feels especially since the films have been about people doing big important things involving the fate of the galaxy or whatever it even ends with a reassertion of the status quo mando and the child out and about what will they find next a big part of the charm is the way that it feels like a world you can live in and it shows people just trying to get by out in the galactic equivalent of a small midwestern farm town sure the empire has fallen and the new republic is starting to get its feet only to fall again by the time rolls around but none of that matters out here they re just trying to raise ugly lizards and gas up their spaceships so they can make it to the next job now that i ve seen it this is the i want more of smaller stories about smaller people being noble or selfish in ways that ripple through their own communities not the whole damn galaxy it s this implication at the heart of that made that movie so compelling and the diversions made into the lives of clone troopers fascinating to watch we come to for the big and spectacular but we stay because it always left room for the small and intimate ,two month ago premiere disney made joke friend funny show better thought unlikely possible ending trilogy well hard nearly many expectation riding eight week later profitable concludes first season finale try much also rock surprisingly better star war mild spoiler follow reason like boil restraint full thing star war movie jedi anyone even force chosen one even particularly concerned place grand narrative sure show make easy figure set number familiar accoutrement overall story much thing let recap eponymous mandalorian bounty hunter take high paying job former imperial officer job turn child special power decides hand child definitely evil imperial holdout go run stoic mandalorian adorable baby adventure aiming say hey cool two three time per episode love inconsequential feel especially since film people big important thing involving fate galaxy whatever even end reassertion status quo mando child find next big part charm way feel like world live show people trying get galactic equivalent small midwestern farm town sure empire fallen new republic starting get foot fall time roll around none matter trying raise ugly lizard gas spaceship make next job seen want smaller story smaller people noble selfish way ripple community whole damn galaxy implication heart made movie compelling diversion made life clone trooper fascinating watch come big spectacular stay always left room small intimate,2019-12-01,215,ago thought unlikely possible ending trilogy expectation riding profitable concludes rock surprisingly mild follow boil restraint jedi anyone chosen concerned grand narrative figure familiar accoutrement overall recap eponymous mandalorian bounty hunter paying imperial officer decides hand definitely evil imperial holdout stoic mandalorian adorable baby adventure aiming hey per inconsequential especially involving fate galaxy whatever reassertion status quo mando charm galactic equivalent midwestern farm town empire fallen republic foot fall roll none raise ugly lizard gas spaceship smaller smaller noble selfish ripple community damn galaxy implication compelling diversion clone trooper fascinating spectacular stay room intimate
