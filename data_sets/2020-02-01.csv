68,Narcos: Mexico is a show for people who want the drug war to last forever,2020-02-14,Joshua Rivera,"started as a show about Pablo Escobar, a real-life gangster who outdid even the most outrageous fictional ones. The show built a compelling two-season crime thriller around his astonishing life and death. But while Escobar died, , — a hit that premiered in 2015, when Netflix was rapidly building its streaming empire — needed to go on. A third season followed another Colombian cartel. Then a spinoff, ,, tracked a parallel cartel in Central America. The first season detailed its rise; the second chronicles its fall. If there was any point to all this, it’s become hard to keep track of. The show is too busy following the cocaine., is the story of Mexico’s first drug kingpin, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (Diego Luna). The 10 episodes that premiere this week detail the dramatic implosion of Gallardo’s empire, a collapse that makes for extremely bingeable television. Yet, despite the thrilling spectacle, exhaustion seeps in. Even though it aims at being something more, , doesn’t seem to have ambitions far beyond those of the criminals it follows, pushing more product. ,The second season of , wants to make a point about consequences, at least on a surface level. The collapse of Gallardo’s empire stems directly from brash actions taken during his ascent — most directly, the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña), which sends agent Walt Breslin on a reckless mission of retribution. There are also bridges burned along the way, friendships set ablaze to use as fuel for ambition that leave many eager to see Gallardo out of power. ,Throughout, , occasionally makes overtures at the grander significance of the story it’s telling. Across 10 episodes, Gallardo’s desperate maneuvers to retain control of his business and stick it to those who have slighted him have consequences that reverberate beyond the criminal underworld, ultimately resulting in a rigged presidential election. “Sound familiar?” the show’s narrator winks. ,There is a long series of assumptions in this, ideas that have been present in , from the start, even as it occasionally paid lip service to their subversion: that Central and South American nations are lawless playgrounds for the corrupt, where prosperity can only be seized by crooks and violence reigns. Every now and then , does its diligence to complicate this picture, almost entirely via narration: a tossed off line that notes the Mexican and Colombian drug trades exist wholly to serve the appetites of the wealthy in the US and Europe, or another about the fundamentally destabilizing influence of the United States’ foreign policy that created problems in exchange for the glow up of “solving” them. ,The actual moral universe of the show is far simpler: dope dealers deserve whatever’s coming to them, the bad guys often win, and the good guys should be able to do whatever it takes to stop them. , can’t truly complicate itself any further because doing so would acknowledge that all these stories are the same story, and in telling them, the show becomes complicit. Midway through the first season of ,, Gallardo (Diego Luna) leaves his native country for a secret meeting in South America. In a moment that’s designed to be a big surprise for longtime , fans, Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) is waiting for him. ,“I’ve always sort of seen this as of the Marvel superhero universe of connecting narcotraffickers, and that they all coexist,” showrunner Eric Newman , not long after the season premiered in 2018. It’s a crass way of describing the dynamics at play in these stories of cartels and corruption, but also a very American one. The gringos, as the Mexicans doing the dirty work for the cartel bosses say, always want more. And what better expression of “more” is there than the excesses of the modern cinematic universe? ,This is how , has carried on, and how it will carry on if it continues its run. Just as , harkened back to , with a well-deployed Escobar cameo depicting a meeting that likely never happened in the real world, the show continues to hint at the ways it will sprawl outward and continue telling these kinds of stories now that it has exhausted the drama of Gallardo’s Federation. It’s not subtle about it either, making sure in its first season that you know Gallardo’s driver Joaquín Guzmán goes by “Chapo” and spending a considerable amount of time this season laying the groundwork for rivalries that he will carry into the future, for what will be one of the most prolonged conflicts in the history of Mexico’s drug war. ,You could tell this story indefinitely, because it is still being told today, with every story of a white person enraged at the sound of Spanish being spoken, with every ICE raid, with every chant for the wall. Cartel dramas like , are fairy tales for a nation in decline, flattening diverse and complicated countries for the benefit of a nation that refuses to acknowledge the havoc it has wreaked on the world.

69,Activision Blizzard exec leaks that Overwatch might become a TV series,2020-02-18,Taylor Lyles,"Since 2014, Blizzard has released so many , cinematic videos for ,that most of us have wondered when Blizzard would finally , to the big screen or as a TV show. (The comparisons to Pixar have been around ,.) Well, an Activision Blizzard executive’s resume now hints that Blizzard did explore the possibility of an actual , TV show, one that might even still be on the way — and there may be a , one, too. ,According to the , of Nick van Dyk, who just so happens to be in charge of the part of Activision Blizzard responsible for building TV shows and movies, he was personally involved in developing and selling an animated , TV show.

70,"Hunters review: good at killing Nazis, and very bad at most other things",2020-02-19,Joshua Rivera," has a premise that feels like a double entendre. Amazon’s Jordan Peele-produced drama about Nazi hunters in the 1970s feels made with this specific moment when white nationalist sentiment gets parroted by government officials and in the national news. Characters are constantly saying things in a way that winkingly acknowledges the camera: ,The delivery always sounds like a dick joke, but the dick is Nazis. ,The slow-burn premiere introduces Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman), a Jewish teenager who lives in Brooklyn with his grandmother. When said grandmother is murdered in their home, Jonah discovers something she hid from the world: she was a member of a secret fraternity of Nazi-hunting vigilantes, exacting revenge on those conspiring to bring about a Fourth Reich. ,Headed by the wealthy Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino), the Hunters (if they sound like a superhero team, that’s intentional) methodically vet and seek out their victims and dole out painful justice on them, making sure they know exactly what crimes they are asking for. Interspersed throughout are interludes and flashbacks to concentration camps and the atrocities committed therein, lest the viewer start to feel that the Hunters are being a little , cruel. ,There are also strange diversions into dance, Guy Ritchie-style title cards but with a Yiddish exploitation twist, and fourth wall-breaking sketches. The villains monologue and salute a long-deceased Hitler with tears in their eyes. , is in the business of hurricane-force whiplash.,The only real anchors in all of this are the show’s two leads, Jonah and Offerman, and unfortunately, only one of them works. Despite being the de facto protagonist, Jonah doesn’t offer much to latch on to as a character. We get brief glimpses of his personal life — his friends, his crush, the anti-Semitic bully who tries to cheat Jonah out of the drugs he has to sell in order to help his grandmother pay the rent — but it’s all in the service of the plot. If we meet a person in his life, it’s because they’re going to ferry him to wherever he needs to be for the next scene to happen. ,This makes all of his big moments feel like they occur in a vacuum — especially when he’s paired up with the other Hunters, all of whom have a disappointingly small amount of screentime. Pacino is great. Everyone else makes you wonder what their deal is. (Also, Josh Radnor is on this show... why?),The five episodes that were made available in advance to critics leave things at a critical juncture halfway through the 10-episode season. Some of ,’ biggest thematic questions revolve around whether ends justify means or if the pursuit of vengeance risks corrupting those who seek it. These are familiar questions, perhaps even tired ones, but it’s possible that , comes up with an interesting answer. ,This is the upshot of a show as tonally uneven as ,: there’s no telling how it’s going to end. It’s hard to be optimistic. While the show does a lot of different things, one thing it doesn’t do is spend its time well. The first episode is nearly an hour and a half long; each of the four that follow clock in at about an hour. An inordinate amount of that time is spent mulling over a missed opportunity, longing for moments with the barely expressed rage of Pacino’s Offerman, or following any of the other Hunters instead of Jonah. It’s telling that, for all its stylistic quirks, the show is at its best when it’s playing it straight: the fourth episode, which tells twin stories of a bank heist and a couple’s desperate escape from a concentration camp, is among the best of the bunch and is delivered in a simple fashion. ,Like the eponymous team it follows, ,has a list of goals, and some of those goals are in conflict with one another. It wants to be a harrowing remembrance of the suffering of the Holocaust, a satisfying revenge fantasy, a sensational period piece, and a dark comedy. These can all be achieved together with skill, but only if the tension between them is acknowledged and addressed. Instead, the show shifts from tone to tone, more temperamental than genre-bending thrill ride.,It’s frustrating because even the ridiculous, preening Nazis of , share a trait that real-life fascists have: they know what they want.

71,Dish Network floats merger with DirecTV over pace of cord-cutting,2020-02-19,Chaim Gartenberg,"The two biggest satellite TV providers — Dish Network and DirecTV — may be looking to merge, according to Dish chairman Charlie Ergen, who called a potential merger with its biggest satellite rival “inevitable” on the company’s Q4 earnings call, according to ,. ,The news comes as Dish reports that in Q4 2019 it lost 100,000 satellite TV subscribers, along with roughly 94,000 Sling TV subscribers — the first time Sling TV’s subscribers have ever gone down. The drop in satellite customers isn’t nearly as bad as Dish reported a year ago, when it lost 386,000 subscribers, but it’s certainly not a good trend to see. All told, Dish lost a net total of 511,000 subscribers in 2019, compared to a loss of about 1.13 million in 2018. ,It’s that ongoing downward trend that led Ergen to comment that Dish and DirecTV “should get together,” noting that “the growth in TV is not coming from linear TV providers, but from huge programmers.” It’s not entirely clear what a merger would look like, given that DirecTV is currently owned by AT&T, but a sale of the satellite portion of AT&T’s TV business to Dish seems like a distinct possibility, especially given AT&T’s focus on new ,. ,Ergen went on to note that there would likely be regulatory issues to work out — after all, Dish and DirecTV already make up a considerable portion of the satellite market, and had already been barred from merging back in 2002 over concerns of eliminating competition. But the increased pressure from nontraditional internet TV services and streaming is taking a toll. “You just can’t swim upstream against a real tide of big players,” Ergen said.

72,How The Mandalorian teamed up with Fortnite creator Epic Games to create its digital sets,2020-02-20,Chaim Gartenberg,"One of the most impressive parts of , (other than ,) was the production design, with the varied locations, sets, and effects despite the comparatively lower budget for television as opposed to a blockbuster film. ,As it turns out, that’s because most of it wasn’t real. Rather, more than half of the season was shot using Industrial Light & Magic’s new StageCraft technology, which uses giant 20-foot-tall LED video screens to create fully digital environments as in-camera sets and backdrops, ,. ,Those environments are purely digital creations, which ILM ,, and then projected around the actors and physical set elements (like spaceship parts or speeder bikes) to create the finished project. As part of that effect, those LED screens are actually then shot on camera for a seamless effect that replicates location shooting without the costs. (The 3D environments are specifically lit and rendered from the perspective of the camera to accomplish that.),There are also real benefits to the virtual sets compared to a traditional green screen setup. Since the actors are actually on the set with the displays, they can see and react to things in the background while they’re actually shooting, instead of imagining effects that will be added later.,It also means that the lightning from those digital sets is present on set and interacting with the physical elements, like the actors and props. So shots where Mando and Baby Yoda sit around a fire, with the sunset shining off Mando’s armor still look right because that light is actually there on set. It’s just coming from an LED screen instead of an actual sun. ,Additionally, because the “sets” are just digitally projected 3D environments, they can be moved around and edited on the fly. Don’t like where a mountain is in the background for a particular shot? Simply move it around, or just delete it entirely. ,ILM had already been using effects like this on existing films, ,, where the “windows” of the Millennium Falcon were digital screens, allowing for the lighting effect of the hyperspace jumps to be projected on the actors’ faces in camera. But , took the technology to a much bigger scale, with a 270-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling that created a 75-foot-wide set.,Again, check out ILM’s video to get the full look at StageCraft. But best of all, ,’s first season is just the start for this new tech.

In this particular AI-powered face swap, Bezos plays a Talosian alien with a huge bald head, while Musk plays Captain Christopher Pike (who is the captain of the USS Enterprise before James T. Kirk). 	,Here’s a very short version of what’s going on in this scene, if you’re wondering: in this episode, the Talosian aliens capture Pike to enslave him and use him to breed humans that will be used to rebuild a destroyed society. Pike tries to escape throughout the episode, and eventually, the Talosians decide that humans’ resistance to captivity won’t make them a good fit for that plan.,The conversation is kind of hard to follow, and that’s probably because the clips from the episode are stitched together to make it seem like it’s only the Talosian alien and Captain Pike having a conversation. In the actual episode, there are a number of other characters who are critical to the conversation that this deepfake doesn’t show. ,But even though the scene is confusing, I think the deepfake is scarily impressive, particularly the unsettling-looking Bezos as a Talosian alien.

75,"New trailers: Stranger Things, Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, and more",2020-02-15,Jacob Kastrenakes,"Every year ahead of the Oscars, all of the animated and live action shorts get bundled together and screened in theaters so people have a chance to check them out. I always go see the animated ones, and they’re always a lovely, strange, beautiful, and very mixed bag.,This year’s had some obvious standouts: ,, which won, really deserves to be a feature; and ,, by Pixar, was heartbreaking and had the best animated cat I’ve ever seen. The other three had some lovely animation — , was my least favorite of the package, and even that one I admired for the way it brought a natural, shaky camera movement to stop-motion animation, which is something I’ve never seen before.,The company that packs all the shorts together always pads out the running time with a few other short films from the year that didn’t snag a nomination. Usually, they’re appreciably worse. But this year, one of the bonus films was among my favorites and deserved to be a contender. It’s called ,, and it’s just six minutes of wonderfully goofy and perfectly done slapstick comedy. I understand why it wasn’t nominated. It’s not “serious,” but that’s exactly why it’s so refreshing.,Check out 10 trailers from this week below.,This is pure Wes Anderson, and there’s not much more to say. The film is about a fictional ,-esque magazine, and it also depicts several of the (also fictional) stories being published in the magazine’s final issue. The trailer is impossible to follow because of how many stories seem to be going on, but really, who cares? It looks great. The film comes out July 24th.,Here’s the thing: after this trailer came out, I read the , for the story of the Green Knight, and it’s just bonkers. None of it makes any sense. But it kind of seems like this movie is playing into that? It comes out May 29th.,We don’t have a season four release date yet, but Netflix pushed out a first teaser for ,’ next season this week and revealed the return of one obviously not dead character. It looks like we’re headed to Russia this season.,This isn’t even a trailer, it’s a “camera test,” which is kind of a ridiculously early release to include in a trailer roundup. But it’s for a big title, so here it is: a first look at Robert Pattinson as Batman. The movie is currently scheduled to come out in June 2021.,This trailer is ostensibly for a movie starring Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it’s absolutely bizarre to watch. The reason why: the distributor is trying its best to hide the fact that this is not really a movie starring Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but a 2019 sequel to a Russian/Chinese film that happens to have the two action stars in small roles. It looks... not great, but I guess that explains why.,The premise is more than a little twee, but it’s worth keeping an eye on ,.

The film comes out March 20th.",every year ahead of the oscars all of the animated and live action shorts get bundled together and screened in theaters so people have a chance to check them out i always go see the animated ones and they re always a lovely strange beautiful and very mixed bag this year s had some obvious standouts which won really deserves to be a feature and by pixar was heartbreaking and had the best animated cat i ve ever seen the other three had some lovely animation was my least favorite of the package and even that one i admired for the way it brought a natural shaky camera movement to stop motion animation which is something i ve never seen before the company that packs all the shorts together always pads out the running time with a few other short films from the year that didn t snag a nomination usually they re appreciably worse but this year one of the bonus films was among my favorites and deserved to be a contender it s called and it s just six minutes of wonderfully goofy and perfectly done slapstick comedy i understand why it wasn t nominated it s not serious but that s exactly why it s so refreshing check out trailers from this week below this is pure wes anderson and there s not much more to say the film is about a fictional esque magazine and it also depicts several of the also fictional stories being published in the magazine s final issue the trailer is impossible to follow because of how many stories seem to be going on but really who cares it looks great the film comes out july th here s the thing after this trailer came out i read the for the story of the green knight and it s just bonkers none of it makes any sense but it kind of seems like this movie is playing into that it comes out may th we don t have a season four release date yet but netflix pushed out a first teaser for next season this week and revealed the return of one obviously not dead character it looks like we re headed to russia this season this isn t even a trailer it s a camera test which is kind of a ridiculously early release to include in a trailer roundup but it s for a big title so here it is a first look at robert pattinson as batman the movie is currently scheduled to come out in june this trailer is ostensibly for a movie starring jackie chan and arnold schwarzenegger but it s absolutely bizarre to watch the reason why the distributor is trying its best to hide the fact that this is not really a movie starring jackie chan and arnold schwarzenegger but a sequel to a russian chinese film that happens to have the two action stars in small roles it looks not great but i guess that explains why the premise is more than a little twee but it s worth keeping an eye on phoebe waller bridge is an executive producer and

76,Netflix’s Gentefied follows a Mexican American family in the heart of a gentrifying LA neighborhood,2020-02-21,Joshua Rivera,"In ,, everyone knows the score. That’s the dark joke about being a young person of color in the US, where access to information is more equitable than the power to use that information. It’s easy to know exactly how you’re being shut out of opportunity and hard to do anything about it. For the Mexican family at the heart of ,, the game is clearly rigged, and winning it might cost more than it’s worth.,Netflix’s new half-hour dramedy from producer America Ferrera and writer / creator duo Linda Yvette Chavez and Marvin Lemus follows a trio of cousins who struggle to keep their grandpa’s taco shop afloat in Los Angeles’ Boyle Heights neighborhood. This is harder than it’s ever been: gentrification is sweeping through the neighborhood, slowly forcing the Chicano population out of town at a time when money isn’t easy to come by. ,Each cousin has their own dream in addition to the family one: Ana wants to be an artist and struggles to scrounge together expensive supplies and find a showcase for her work. Erik is torn between being responsible for running the shop and his desire to have a family of his own. Chris, just back from college, wants to be a chef in Paris, though it means stifling his Mexican heritage. ,In following the three of them and those in their orbit, , is both a celebration of a modern Mexican American family and also the story about their struggle against the ever-present threat of erasure.

Ana’s desire to find a platform for her art puts her at odds with her activist friends. Erik’s pride and machismo jeopardize the profitability of the shop and his relationship with Lydia, his estranged, pregnant ex who he wants to prove he’s good enough for. ,Lined up above them all are the invisible guillotines that dangle over many people of color in America.

A lot of the same tropes are present, whether it’s a show like , or ,or , before it. There are millennials who want all the same Instagram-friendly food and decor for taco Tuesday, landlords who would rather rent to said millennials at top dollar than the already-high rates they charge their current tenants of color, and the upper-middle-class institutions that only really want people of color if they clean up their act.

In ,, there’s the modern wrinkle of “authenticity,” the monied interest in a culture sanitized for white consumption and social media clout without any concern for place, for people, for history. It is a constant pressure, easy to give in to and fun to participate in. ,It’s also impermanent. Soon, there will be something else. The tastemakers will move to another neighborhood, and no one will care for the accommodations once made for them. This is the existential threat facing the children of immigrants now. Fighting it seems impossible, an extra set of obstacles in addition to the regular set of hurdles you have to clear in order to achieve the better life your parents want for you.

77,Better Call Saul knows how much we love a good scam,2020-02-25,Joshua Rivera," was always going to be a show about a man dying in slow motion. At the start of the series, Saul Goodman — best known as Walter White’s huckster lawyer in , — goes by another name, the one given to him at birth. Jimmy McGill is a different, more earnest person than Saul Goodman, someone who does not exist in ,. Unlike Walter White, we know exactly what’s going to happen to Jimmy, and ,is a better show for it. ,In the show’s fifth season, Jimmy’s transformation into Saul is nearly complete. McGill is getting his feet under him after the death of his brother and the end of a yearlong suspension from practicing law. Now, he’s back in the saddle and trying to build his practice as fast as possible under his Saul Goodman alias, which he used for much of the last season to build connections with petty criminals he sold burner phones to for fast cash. ,It’s all so very sad, even if Bob Odenkirk’s carnival barker performance as Jimmy / Saul is as entertaining and funny as it’s always been. As a man who lost his brother, Jimmy never gives himself the opportunity to mourn, instead throwing himself back into the world of two-bit hustles that he knows best, working over suckers and building his reputation in the untapped market of low-level criminals in the habit of committing misdemeanors. Bit by bit, Jimmy McGill is being buried alive, and Saul Goodman is holding the shovel. ,Like the show from which it spun off, ,’s dramatic arc is an inevitable one. We know that things aren’t going to end well from the start — to a degree that , might sound repetitive to people who have seen ,. On a superficial level, this is true: both are shows about a man going sour. But the hows and whys of ,’s downward slide feel more vital and relevant, perhaps because they are more tragic. ,If ,showed us what entitled toxic masculinity looked like when it ran rampant in the life of the most milquetoast protagonist imaginable, , is about a slower, sadder thing: a man who learns that having feelings is for suckers. It’s a show for the irony-poisoned and extremely online where nothing is assumed to be genuine, and everything is probably a scam. , is concerned with what happens when people decide that scamming is the only way to win, and the immense harm inflicted by people who have convinced themselves that anyone behaving earnestly is just playing the game wrong. In ,, this is illustrated by Kim Wexler, Jimmy’s longtime friend and girlfriend / partner, a damn good lawyer in her own right with a bit of a grifter’s streak in her. ,Kim, however, is a character of integrity with a sense of justice and lines that she only crosses when that notion of justice is violated. She’s a vigilante scammer where McGill is an equal-opportunity swindler. At the end of the day, she believes in the system and in Jimmy’s capacity to be an honest man. This means, in ,’s universe, she’s doomed. ,In this penultimate season — the show will only return for one more — Kim is learning a truth that Jimmy’s in denial of: no matter how much you tell someone that they are capable of being honest or good, once they have decided that truth does not pay, it’s only a matter of time before they stop maintaining the charade altogether. And once someone has lost every reason to believe in earnest feeling or honesty or justice, they slowly start believing everyone else has, too. ,This is what , has been building toward: a fifth season premiere where Jimmy, as Saul Goodman, erects a carnival tent in an empty lot, surrounded by people who he believes are lost causes who will eventually need a lost cause like himself. The descent is more or less complete. As Jimmy builds the Goodman name, the cartel power players from , begin asserting themselves, and the gilded cage Saul Goodman will ultimately try to flee at the end of that series is nearing completion. He’s going to have it good for a while, though. Grifters always do. That’s part of the problem: we love a good scam. Feelings are for suckers.

78,"New trailers: Westworld, Amazing Stories, and more",2020-02-22,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I recently watched ,, Joanna Hogg’s partly autobiographical film about a young filmmaker who gets wrapped up in a toxic and emotionally abusive relationship with an older man.

The entire beginning of the central romantic relationship is left offscreen, as is all but the ending of a very significant argument between the couple.

81,"In I Am Not Okay With This, being a teen girl does not get easier with superpowers",2020-02-28,Joshua Rivera," begins with Sydney Novak, covered in blood, running down the middle of the street at night. There are probably other ways she’d rather be spending her time. That would seem to make sense with the series’s narrative: her life is pretty normal — up until the part where you find out she has superpowers that allow her to blow things up with her mind. ,Netflix’s new comedy is a work of low-key dread that recalls a lot of other stories about young women coming of age. It has ,’s supernatural angst, ,’s oddball quirk, and the smart-twee edge of ,. Syd is a gross weirdo — she’s equally fascinated and frustrated by her leg acne, pretty fine with being ostracized by her classmates, and perplexed by the people she is attracted to. The difference here is that Syd is also very, very angry.,Sydney’s powers are a manifestation of her rage, and she has plenty to be mad about. Her best friend has fallen for a crude jock, her single mom is overworked and demanding, and, as the show slowly reveals, there’s a deep family trauma that has haunted her since before the series began. ,But even with this in mind, , spends most of its time being more charming than angry. Much of it focuses on Syd’s budding relationship with fellow weirdo Stanley Barber. Stanley is played by Wyatt Oleff — best known as one of the kids in , — who reads here as Timothee Chalamet, but a little bit wrong. This plays incredibly well opposite Sophia Lillis’ Syd, another , star and a tremendously talented young actor. ,Lillis juggles all of Sydney’s wildly conflicting emotions with ease, able to simultaneously portray the anxieties expressed in the running narration from Syd’s diary that’s read throughout the show and the quirky facade she presents to the world. With only seven short episodes, there’s not a whole lot of plot to burn through, but Lillis’ performance never lets you forget the multitude of emotions burning beneath Syd’s disaffected exterior. , doesn’t really end as much as it stops in its tracks. The season finishes with an abrupt conclusion that is clearly meant to set up a second season, but it also brings little in the way of resolution — something that feels a bit unfair given how lean and sharp the show is, each episode taking only just the time it needs to make its point and leave. (Usually, this doesn’t take much more than 20 minutes.),It doesn’t help that its cliffhanger ending tugs at the one plot thread that would make the show stand out beyond its new-school take on ,. Since its first image immediately conjures ,’s climax, the comparison is unavoidable and will immediately cause you to guess where,is going. (You probably won’t be that far off from the truth.) There’s more to this story, and readers of the Charles Forsman graphic novel it’s based on might be frustrated at some of its most fascinating and darkest plot beats are being reserved for another set of episodes. ,Despite this, ,works really well because of all the things it conveys without speaking a word, all of them difficult: being a young woman who doesn’t adhere to a narrow definition of femininity, who is figuring out her sexuality, who is handling grief, disillusionment, poverty, , superpowers.

114,Google Fiber is dropping its TV package to focus solely on high-speed internet service,2020-02-04,Nick Statt,"Google Fiber announced today that it , to focus solely on providing high-speed internet service. It will still provide the service to existing customers who pay for it, but the company says “customers today just don’t need traditional TV” anymore when so many options are available online through over-the-top TV services and streaming platforms. ,“As of today, Google Fiber will no longer offer a linear TV product to new customers. For our current TV customers, we know you have come to rely on Google Fiber TV and we will continue to provide you with traditional TV service,” the company said in a blog post. “And we’ll be happy to help everyone explore other options to get their favorite programming the way TV is watched now — over the Internet, with the virtually unlimited choice and control online viewing provides.” ,Google says it is partnering with FuboTV, an over-the-top provider that specializes in sports programming. That way, new Fiber customers can sign up for Fubo alongside an internet subscription. Google says this is in addition to YouTube TV, its own pay-TV service that has some similar benefits to Fubo. ,Google Fiber, which exists under the Access division of Google parent company Alphabet, is positioning this as a liberating choice for consumers to take control of their media-viewing destinies. But it’s not quite that simple. The truth is that Google Fiber was forking over huge licensing fees to carry traditional TV channels, including big-name cable and sports networks. ,In many cases, what Google Fiber was paying was not the same as what competitors like Comcast and others pay to bundle traditional cable with internet service, due to legacy deals and vertical integration between internet service providers and cable companies. (For example, Comcast operates both its Xfinity cable and internet service while also owning NBCUniversal.) ,, “the cost of acquiring video content was ‘the single biggest impediment’ to Google Fiber’s wider rollout, a top Google Fiber executive, Milo Medin, told an audience in 2014. Compared with more established service providers, Medin said, Google was paying twice as much for video rights.” ,There are other issues, too. Google Fiber was offering a TV option — specifically an IPTV option and not cable or satellite — particularly so it could entice more traditional double- and triple-play customers in the Midwest and other midsize American cities, where Google Fiber was focusing its efforts early on. But the company has struggled over the past five years to make inroads in those markets as the cost of deploying fiber internet was astronomical and the challenge of beating out incumbents like Comcast became increasingly costly. ,In 2016, Google Fiber , amid a restructuring and a round of layoffs, after the company became a separate business unit under Alphabet proper and no longer existed under the core Google umbrella. (Moving Fiber outside Google meant it had more stringent financial obligations to turn a profit and not excessively waste money.) ,Google Fiber has since experimented with its Webpass subsidiary to try to deliver high-speed internet not through fiber optic cables, but with over-the-air transmission technologies. (In one market Webpass was deployed, Boston, Google eventually ,, too.) The company has also slowed its overall expansion considerably. As it stands today, Google Fiber is only available in 18 markets throughout the US. ,Last year, Google Fiber suffered yet another public defeat after it had to , after attempting a method of fiber installation called “shallow trenching” that would have sped up its deployment time, but that failed to hold up over time due to how close to the surface the cables were lying. Instead of starting over from scratch, Google Fiber decided to end service on April 15th of last year. Google Fiber is now , for botching the whole project. ,So it makes sense that, in 2020, Google Fiber doesn’t quite need a TV service that it pays a fortune for, especially as it’s still working to make its internet service an attractive option for consumers and a financially sound one for its parent company. ",google fiber announced today that it to focus solely on providing high speed internet service it will still provide the service to existing customers who pay for it but the company says customers

115,The Good Place finale is a gentle end to a challenging show,2020-02-03,Joshua Rivera,"For four years, , felt like one of the most radical shows on television. A series that was initially about what happens when the wrong person goes to heaven transformed into a meditation on what it means to be a good person, and how no one is beyond redemption. That it aired during a time where cruelty led to a parade of demoralizing victories in politics and culture made it feel even more miraculous, a kind show for mean times. With its series finale, ,chose not to overstay its welcome, ending gently with a 90-minute conclusion that held no surprises — except, maybe, how disappointing fulfillment can be. ,“Whenever You’re Ready” begins its long goodbye with every conflict in the series resolved in the previous episode. Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, Tahani, Michael, and Janet have arrived in heaven and devised a perfect, equitable afterlife for all humans to go through. Upon death, everyone enters a time of testing and reflection, which they must pass in order to enter The Good Place. Once a person is in, they stay until they’re ready to walk through a door and fade into nothingness.,As the episode unfolds, each character eventually finds fulfillment and decides to leave, one at a time. First are Jason and Tahani, characters who have been underserved by the show for some time now, mostly reduced to one-note jokes. The show makes up for that a little: Jason’s departure is a small fake out; he ends up being stranded outside of the final door for eons because he forgot to give something to Janet. In doing this, he learns the inner peace and patience that makes him attain, inadvertently, the kind of spirituality he pretended to have at the start of the show as a silent monk. ,Tahani decides to not go through the door, instead choosing to try her hand at becoming an afterlife architect — a move that signals a shift in her ambitions, applying them to the service of others instead of herself. It’s a nice ending, but one that underlines a solid two seasons of missed opportunities for the character. ,The finale’s heart, however, is with the character , started with: Eleanor Shellstrop, who still has a few lessons to learn. The first involves letting go and accepting Chidi’s decision to go through the last door. The second is in helping someone else learn to let go, convincing the Middle Place’s sole inhabitant, Mindy St. Claire, to finally give up her post and enter the rebuilt afterlife. Finally, Eleanor guides Michael to the one ending that would make him truly happy: a mortal life.,There are beautiful moments in this. Despite the long-standing criticism of Chidi and Eleanor’s relationship remaining valid — the two have never worked as much as the show believed they did — actors William Jackson Harper and Kristen Bell pour their hearts into their final scene together, with a conversation about oblivion that is life-affirming and not an existential terror. The brief few moments we see of Michael’s human life are wonderfully endearing. It’s all a very nice ending for a very nice show. ,It all feels a little hollow, though. , at its best was often about how being good was ,. It is difficult and prone to going awry; your ideas of what constitutes “good” might not ultimately translate to a net positive in the cosmic balance. This is why, , argued, we need friends — other people who wanted to be good to others as much as you did, and who had different ideas about how to do that. ,Attempting to live a good life often feels like it isn’t rewarding or ultimately worth it, but ,’s best moments showed that you could build a community where it , worth it, an internal dynamic built around justice and fulfillment that, with time and good fortune, might radiate outward and change someone’s life. ,There is uncertainty in this. We don’t really get to know the kind of impact we have, if we make one at all. At the apex of ,’s storytelling prowess — the season 2 finale, “Somewhere Else” — ,the show,dug into this idea, with each character having a second chance at a mortal life. With no memory of her previous life or afterlife, Eleanor tries to live ethically, and it goes poorly. The episode ends with Eleanor nudged in the direction of finding Chidi and her former friends, and fades to black before she gets there. , I loved wasn’t one that trafficked in certainty about anything. It was a show about ,, about a secular faith in living a noble life without the guarantee of a material reward. It showed a cast of chronically selfish people learning to mitigate their selfishness by caring more for each other, even in the face of a cartoonishly elaborate demon bureaucracy that wanted them to believe none of that mattered. It was nice to see them be rewarded in the end. I want to believe they would’ve done it all the same, even if they weren’t.

118,Faze Clan is launching a Quibi reality show to sign its next gaming star,2020-02-04,Nick Statt,"Gaming entertainment and e-sports organization Faze Clan is taking a unique approach to signing who it hopes will become the next big gaming star: a reality show. The Los Angeles-based company has partnered with yet-to-be-released streaming service Quibi to produce ,, a contest that will see six users of the Quibi app compete to be the next signed Faze member. To participate, contestants will need to ,. ,“Utilizing its interactive mobile technology, Quibi — along with key members of the Faze Clan — will open up one potential spot on the Faze Clan team. Then, Quibi subscribers will uniquely be able to submit a video pleading their case for a chance to join the team,” reads the show’s description. “Quibi subscribers will then vote through the Quibi app for the six lucky people that deserve a shot at gamer glory. From there, contestants will travel to the Faze Clan mansion to go through a series of real-life and gaming challenges, until one gamer — selected by Faze — is left standing.”,It’s an interesting concept that hasn’t really been seen in the e-sports industry. Most professional video game players today are scouted either through the top leaderboards and tournaments of popular titles like ,and , or they’re already well-known social media personalities with big followings on Twitch and YouTube. From there, an organization like Faze would sign a contract with the player to bring them onto its roster of talent, which can involve being a content creator or competing as part of an established e-sports team dedicated to a distinct title (in some cases, both).,A reality show approach, however, brings a much more dramatic and Hollywood-esque flair to the process that might appeal to a different type of gaming competitor or online creator. The description for , doesn’t say that potential contestants have to be top-tier in any one game or that they even need to have a substantial social media presence. ,So while it’s safe to say potential contestants will likely need to be avid gamers and probably talented in at least one or more titles, being virtuosic at gaming — like current Faze e-sports players — does not seem like a strict requirement. The selection process also appears to depend heavily on the user-submitted videos and the viewer-centric voting, meaning it could be more about having a dynamic personality than exhibiting impressive gaming skills. ,“Over the past 10 years, Faze Clan has not only contributed to the growth of the gaming lifestyle and the e-sports community, but we have broken barriers and are not afraid to disrupt the status quo,” said Oluwafemi Okusanya, Faze’s head of content, in a statement.  “In 2020, we plan to do the same with content creation and media distribution. The,show represents our next chapter in content creation with our first premium production effort.” ,Like its ,, Faze is as much an entertainment and lifestyle brand as it is a serious e-sports competitor. It maintains six well-funded and talented pro teams across a variety of the industry’s biggest games. That includes a newly minted, Atlanta-based ,League team that just ,. ,But Faze also maintains a growing apparel business and has a massive focus on brand deals, sponsorships, talent management, and professional video creation. A majority of the 85 or so official Faze members are not, in fact, e-sports athletes; instead, they’re content creators and influencers. Even ,. As , in a recent Faze profile last November, the company is “the Dallas Cowboys meets Supreme meets MTV.”  ,In that context, a reality show on a buzzed-about new streaming service like Quibi makes perfect sense for Faze.

119,Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet is a comedy surprise you can’t miss ,2020-02-07,Joshua Rivera,"Video games are a hard thing to love. The medium rarely translates well outside of its own little island — think of all the bad video game adaptations we’ve seen, or how “video game” is usually used as a shorthand for “shallow” when used to describe stories in other media. Games culture does not advocate for itself terribly well. So it’s natural, then, to cringe when you hear of a show like ,, an Apple TV comedy about a fictional video game studio that produces a ,-esque online game. Will it work out? Will people who know about games like it? Will people who don’t? Is it even funny? You get jaded. But instead of another painful serving of,-style nonsense, , is legitimately good on its own merits, and one of the first big TV surprises of the year.,The nine-episode first season, now streaming on Apple TV Plus, follows Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney), creative director of the wildly popular online role-playing game ,, and his fellow developers as they prepare to release their first big expansion, , There’s Poppi (Charlotte Nicdao), the lead developer; Brad (Danny Pudi), the sociopathic money guy; C.W. Longbottom (F. Murray Abraham), the washed-up fantasy writer; and David (David Hornsby), the co-founder who tries to corral them all — which can be difficult because they all hate each other.,This is why , works, even if you don’t know the first thing about video games. It’s about a bunch of misanthropes working together, with comedy derived from the dark ways their toxic relationships push and pull each other around. You don’t need to know how a studio works to recognize an office hierarchy when you see one, or an egomaniac boss, or a shitty coworker that skates on your hard work. ,But it’s also very interested in video games, and it’s not overly concerned with making them look good or demanding anyone take them seriously. In fact, the show is pretty unsparing. The game studio is beholden to the opinions of a dirtbag teen streamer who rates video games on a five-butthole scale, labor is casually exploited, players are gleefully taken advantage of, and in one of the best episodes, it turns out Nazis really love the game they make. ,What makes , so satisfying is how all of its comedy is steeped in character, not in how video games are inherently goofy or ridiculous (though they often are). Watching it, you can trace lines to the sort of comedies from which it’s descended. , is the easiest connection, as co-creators Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Megan Ganz all come from that show. But there’s also a little bit of , in how the small decisions characters make — adding a shovel to their game, opening up an in-game casino, introducing a big mystery to fans without having any idea what the answer is — spiral out into small hurricanes that can result in a farce on corporate sensitivity panels or the formation of a labor union. ,A video game studio makes for a good workplace comedy in 2020, and not because of the widespread industry sentiment about how it deserves its cultural due after years of economic dominance (Don Draper ,). Instead, it’s the perfect place to get a clear look at what work is increasingly starting to look like now that the robber barons of tech have built their empires: largely behind screens, mostly for the filthy rich, all feeding a digital beast that only exists to further its own existence. ,Video game employees are the lucky ones. They get to be exploited while contributing to something they ostensibly like. Everyone else gets all the dysfunction and none of the snacks.

123,BoJack Horseman was a powerful show about addiction and a messy one about celebrity,2020-02-05,Joshua Rivera,"As, progressed through its six seasons, the show’s most obvious punchline didn’t get funnier; it got scarier.,Yes, the cartoon horse was depressed. And an alcoholic. And he hurt the man with cancer. And gave the teens booze. And nearly slept with one. And tanked careers in order to save his own. And left someone to die. But when ,concluded with its final eight episodes, it wasn’t interested in a laugh so much as a reckoning.,BoJack Horseman,Everything finally catches up to BoJack, in a way. A Netflix original about a former sitcom star attempting a comeback while also dealing with addiction and depression, , followed an anthropomorphic horse who continually tried to dull the pain of his previous bad behavior with something worse. As the show grew in scope and fleshed out a large cast of characters, it explored all kinds of ideas and stories, but the two most persistent ones were directly tied to its main character: addiction and the way celebrity fosters and protects toxicity. With its finale, the show finally locks BoJack up (for breaking and entering after a near-fatal bender), following him on a break from his 14-month sentence, which was granted so he can attend his friend and former agent Princess Carolyn’s wedding.,Maybe it seems disingenuous to suggest a show that put its main character in prison for bad behavior is somehow letting him off the hook, but ,’s bittersweet farewell to its protagonist is a goodbye that chooses the parts of the show about addiction and recovery at the expense of those about abuse and power. It’s a decision that comes across as odd when the entire final season was built around taking stock of BoJack’s awful actions throughout the whole series and bringing them to light in a way that mirrors the way real-world bad men have been exposed in recent years.,When reporters piece together BoJack’s complicity in the death of his former child co-star Sarah-Lynn, along with many of his other misdeeds, the quieter life he’s come to find and love — sober, teaching college theater — comes crashing down. He gives a nationally televised interview that initially goes well for him, given our culture’s tendency to favor repentant men over their victims. Goaded by this success, BoJack does a follow-up interview, and this one reveals his pattern of abusive and predatory behavior for all the world to see. , is often overwhelmingly focused on its characters’ interiority — to the point that it had to remind the audience in stark, horrific terms that its protagonist’s selfish actions had real and devastating effects on the people around him. (One of the main ideas behind , was a cautionary tale about identifying with characters like BoJack too much.) In reminding viewers of its very large cast of characters and the ways almost all of them have been hurt or used up by BoJack,— a few to their last breath — season 6 of the show is about as damning as you can get.,Yet, Princess Carolyn’s wedding is a bittersweet finale that reads as strangely fond of BoJack. , isn’t unsympathetic to his victims. By the time the series ends, his former friends have drawn new boundaries around their lives, and it’s not particularly clear if there will be room for BoJack in them when he gets his freedom back. They all are friendly with him, sure, but he’s also presumably haunted by the ghosts of the people who won’t even see him or can’t. ,That guilt is only alluded to in the finale proper, but it’s explicitly given its due in the penultimate episode, “The View From Halfway Down,” a near-death vision of hell or purgatory that traps BoJack in a dinner party with everyone he’s ever hurt. ,’s finale, “Nice While It Lasted,” is mostly preoccupied with how a man who’s made all of these mistakes might go on with his life. ,In the end, it was always a messy idea to marry a story about mental health and addiction to a story about a powerful, abusive celebrity. Power muddies the waters, demanding a specific response when , ultimately wants to contemplate more universal ones. What do you do when you let your demons get the best of you, when you’ve done things that are unforgivable? Can you find redemption? What do you do when you’ve done awful things, and the only answer you know for sure is that life’s a bitch, and you keep living? ,A television show doesn’t owe anyone a moral roadmap for living our lives, or even a particularly moral fictional universe. BoJack can keep getting away with things, and , could probably make compelling TV out of it. (Showrunner Raphael Bob-Waksberg had , on having at least one more season.) The trouble is when , collapses two of its running themes — one of mental health and addiction and the other of power and abuse — into a single conclusion, suggesting that they complement each other when they do not. In the end, , loved BoJack Horseman too much. ,This result — a finale that asks “How does BoJack go on with his life now?”,without really giving a solid answer — is a fitting one for a show that wanted to explore the life of an awful person with unexamined mental health issues and addiction. But for the other ,, the show about a powerful celebrity who was once washed up and finds his way to relevance again through the discarded lives of the people around him, that ambiguity feels too kind. It’s dishonest about the nature of power, which lets people behave with impunity because the rules are different for them. This does not mean redemption and rehabilitation are impossible, but the rules for them, by necessity, are different, too. , never really makes that distinction, and it’s arguably poorer for it.,In this way, , recalls the finale of ,, another show that went long and hard in its final episodes to damn its protagonist, only to bid farewell wistfully as the music played and its hero, while superficially punished, enjoyed one last moment with the life they stole. Perhaps there is honesty in this — life isn’t so neat, and attempts at being good don’t always work out — but I could find a way to wish BoJack, the horse-man all-time screw-up, all the best in his life, even if I didn’t want him in mine any longer. BoJack the TV and movie star? He can rot.

124,Netflix’s Locke and Key mashes up Riverdale and The Haunting of Hill House,2020-02-06,Andrew Webster," is what would happen if you took the brooding teen drama of , and combined it with the all-too-real family tragedy and otherworldly scares of , , ,. That might make Netflix’s latest series sound derivative. But while it shares a similar tone as other shows on the service — , fans will find a lot to enjoy here — ,’s wildly creative premise gives it its own unique flavor. Yes, it’s dark, magical, and dramatic but in a way you’ve never seen before.,The show is based on the decade-old comic series of the same name by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez, and the premise is largely the same. Following the death of her husband, Rendell (Bill Heck), Nina Locke (Darby Stanchfield) packs up her three kids and moves them to an old family home in small-town Massachusetts. That home, called Keyhouse (please don’t dwell too long on the on-the-nose naming conventions) is a sprawling New England estate that also happens to be home to a number of magical keys. Things really pick up when Bode (Jackson Robert Scott), the youngest kid, finds a woman named Dodge trapped in a well on the property who turns out to be some kind of evil demon.,The keys are really — and I’m sorry to say it like this — the key to the whole show. Each has a distinct ability. One can unlock a person’s mind so they can step through a door into a world made up of their thoughts and memories. Another lets people travel anywhere just by unlocking the closest door. One fixes things, one turns people into ghosts, and others control people or trap them in a terrifying mirror world. They have satisfying names like the Anywhere Key and the Head Key. Bode accidentally stumbles onto the keys because they whisper to him; as he explores the house, he can hear them, and once found, he tries to figure out what they do. Eventually, his older siblings join in, and the trio takes control of the keys., is a mystery — actually, it’s a few mysteries, and each intertwines with another. There are the keys themselves, of course: where they came from, why they’re here, what they do. There’s also the murder of the Locke patriarch and, oh yeah, that demon lady living in the well. All of these mysteries are connected in ways I won’t spoil, and they’re layered into a story that’s, at its heart, about family. There’s Nina struggling with alcoholism after the death of her husband, teenagers Tyler (Connor Jessup) and Kinsey (Emilia Jones) trying to fit in at a new high school, and Bode being a small, curious kid surrounded by problems way beyond his age. Throw in the keys, and the result is dark, messy, and intricate.,While all of these elements are prominent, the show has a particularly tight focus on Tyler and Kinsey and the ensuing high school drama that entails. There are subplots about dating and dances, but they don’t feel forced or out of place. Instead, the writing does a great job of connecting everything, whether it’s a new key with horrifying potential or Kinsey figuring out who she wants to go out with. (At one point, she finally starts dating after using the Head Key to remove her fear, so she’s no longer scared to make a move.) The drawback of this focus is that the show doesn’t fully explore the intriguing, deep mythology that’s in the comics. Essentially, the show expands the focus on characters and the expense of lore. For the most part, the trade-off works. It also provides more fruitful ground for future seasons, which will likely depart even further from the source material.,On the surface, , looks like plenty of shows that are already out there. It’s dark and moody, mixing teen angst with lots of magic. But within that familiar framework, it does just enough to stand out. The inventive premise creates the kind of mystery that makes you hit “next episode,” while each new key reveal further expands the magical possibilities. For a show that can feel so familiar, it does a remarkable job of keeping you guessing. The fact that it’s a largely faithful adaptation of an iconic comic series is just a bonus.", is what would happen if you took the brooding teen drama of and combined it with the all too real family

126,"New trailers: Mulan, Spiral, The Jesus Rolls, and more",2020-02-08,Jacob Kastrenakes," wrapped up last week — I won’t get into much detail here (I feel like a ton of people are waiting to watch it when the whole season’s available on Netflix) — but I did want to write briefly about just what a great series it’s been.,One of the things that made ,so great was just how much of a plot it infused into the traditional sitcom formula. Yes, a typical episode involved a core cast of characters dealing with a somewhat predictable set of hijinks, but there was almost always constant forward movement. That pressure made every episode feel fresh and important, and the added tension made the comedy play that much stronger.,One thing I found fascinating about the final episode (again, no spoilers) was how the show almost stepped outside of that structure. It felt more like a coda than a true conclusion (which, arguably, came earlier). That made for a lovely, if also surprisingly relaxed, sendoff and some really sweet moments with its core cast. More than anything else, I really appreciated the show’s dedication to giving Ted Danson truly perfect human lines right until the end.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Disney put out a final trailer for , this week, showing off more of its colorful, cleanly shot, and epic battle sequences. I haven’t come away with a particularly strong understanding of what the movie will be like from all these trailers — in fairness, most people probably have a good understanding of the story already. Mostly, it seems like Disney,just wants to get across how beautiful and inspiring it’s intended to be. The film comes out March 27th.,The new Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson movie is, somehow, a , spinoff and, somehow, also more of an action movie than a horror movie. At the same time, this will probably be one of the best , movies. It comes out May 15th.,With the Coen Brothers’ permission, John Turturro is bringing back his brief but colorful character from ,. , has a great cast and, whether this character can sustain a full film or not, looks like plenty of fun from this first trailer. It comes out March 6th.,A new documentary series that debuted on Netflix this week takes a look at the history of black actors in Hollywood. It speaks to some huge names — Whoopi Goldberg, Barry Jenkins, and John Boyega among them — and seems to look ahead at what the future holds for black artists in film.,I hate to include a teaser this brief, but Disney’s 30-second Super Bowl spot included the very first footage from three highly anticipated series — series that’ll be key to whether Disney+’s momentum can continue: ,, ,, and ,. , arrives in August; , premieres in December; and , is expected next year.,The director of , and — more aptly, in this case — the 2018 , remake returns with a new short film that looks and sounds more like something shot 60 years ago. I’m not really clear on what’s going on, but it looks wonderfully moody and creepy. The short premieres February 15th on Mubi.,Two sisters work together to cover up a murder after one of them kills a man in ,. For something with such a dark premise, the movie looks surprisingly charming and funny. It comes out March 20th.,The director of , has a new series coming up that appears to be a globe-spanning epic about the cocaine trade. It comes to Amazon on March 6th.,So for one, , is coming back with Chance the Rapper as its star. But on a broader note, this is one of the first trailers for the series set to arrive after Quibi launches on April 6th.

127,Oscars 2020: how to watch the Academy Awards online ,2020-02-09,Cameron Faulkner,"The 92nd Academy Awards (also known as the Oscars) will broadcast tonight, February 9th. It’s a celebration of the industry and a showdown between the year’s biggest movies, filmmakers, and all of the people who make them special, including actors, screenwriters, and more. ,We’ll dig into when and how you can watch the stream below, but first, let’s set the stage for the event.,Last year’s awards show was the Academy’s first in 30 years to not have a host. Kevin Hart withdrew after , on his personal Twitter account and related anti-gay stand-up material resurfaced. This year’s Oscars continues its host-less streak in 2020, and the Academy is attempting to once again fill the gaps with presenters who are decidedly less controversial. The list is very long, but some notable names include Spike Lee, Brie Larson, Gal Gadot, Steve Martin, Rami Malek, Keanu Reeves, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and ,.,ABC is handling the televised stream, which starts at 8PM ET / 5PM PT. If you want to watch celebrities walk into the building on a red carpet, tune in at 6:30PM ET / 3:30PM PT instead.,ABC is accessible via an over-the-air antenna, but otherwise, you’ll have to be a subscriber in some form to gain access to the awards show. If you have cable or satellite service, you’re probably all set. (I hedge with “probably” because ,.) You can watch it on the ABC channel, or you can watch through your browser by logging in to ABC’s site with your cable or satellite credentials. ,Alternatively, a few over-the-top streaming services offer ABC with a subscription. Again, availability varies by region, but most people who subscribe to YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, Sling TV, and FuboTV should have access. And if you only want to subscribe to watch for this one night, you’ll be happy to know that all of these services offer a free trial of varying lengths (though all require credit card information to sign up).,ABC hasn’t updated its list of international partners that will broadcast the Oscars since 2017. But if you live outside of the US, ,.,Todd Phillips’ divisive , received 11 Oscar nominations, the most of any film in the runnings this year. ,, ,, and , each received 10 nominations. ,, ,, ,, and , each were nominated in six different categories.,. Below is some required reading if you want to catch up on the discourse surrounding this year’s most talked-about films.,Updated 3:46PM ET, February 9th: FuboTV has been removed from the list of over-the-top streaming services due to the fact that it doesn't host ABC.
