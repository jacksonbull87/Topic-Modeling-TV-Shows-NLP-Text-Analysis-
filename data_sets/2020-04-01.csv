5,Mindy Kaling’s new teen sitcom Never Have I Ever is an empathetic exploration of grief,2020-05-01,Joshua Rivera,"If you told everyone exactly how high school would play out, odds are many would opt the hell out. High school in America is a bizarre and unkind time, a collective coming-of-age story that has as much room for variety as there are people who go through it. ,, a new Netflix sitcom from , creator Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher, takes the broad strokes of high school and gives them new life by centering its story on an Indian-American girl. It’s an absolute delight, one of the most pleasant new binge-watches you can do right now. ,That doesn’t mean the show is all sunshine — , begins with a tragedy when protagonist Devi Vishwakumar’s (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) father Mohan (Sendhil Ramamurthy) suddenly dies, and shortly after, Devi inexplicably loses the use of her legs. (This is all in the first few minutes). As Devi is starting to get used to life without her father and with her disability, her mobility returns, just as curiously as it left. , is the story of Devi’s attempt to return to a normal life, and Devi wants to return with a bang — literally, by losing her virginity to Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet) the hottest boy in school. ,Perhaps this might not strike you as a healthy thing for someone, real or fictional, to do. That would be the point: , isn’t just an Indian-American take on the coming-of-age story, but also a story that takes teen rom-com tropes and turns them into a vehicle for exploring grief. None of this ever takes a backseat to ,’s comedy or its earnest, empathetic storytelling. The show strives to keep its stakes small and focused on Devi and her friends and family, but they’re surrounded by a cast of friends and family diverse and interesting enough to support a much bigger show. ,While each character can’t have a subplot of their own, they’re all afforded the potential for depth. Every character is going through something, experiencing their foundational traumas in real time. The central conflict of the show is Devi’s inability to see this, slowly realizing that the process of dealing with her own extraordinary grief blinds her to what others are experiencing, and that dealing with that grief poorly can also cost her the connections that will help her move on. ,Again: ,is also a very good comedy that consistently delights. There’s clever and fun narration from tennis superstar John McEnroe (there’s a reason for this); a bright, danceable soundtrack that prominently features Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own” in the pilot and stays in that sonic milieu throughout; and it features a cast of wonderfully charismatic young actors. , feels like what would have been a cult favorite in a previous generation of television, a ,-style one-season wonder. But times are very different now, and an Indian-American lead is a refreshing change for this type of show — especially one that might last.",if you told everyone exactly how high school would play out odds are many would opt the hell out high school in america is a bizarre and unkind time a collective coming of age story that has as much room for variety as there are people who go through it a new netflix sitcom from creator mindy kaling and lang fisher takes the broad strokes of high school and gives them new life by centering its story on an indian american girl it s an absolute delight one of the most pleasant new binge watches you can do right now that doesn t mean the show is all sunshine begins with a tragedy when protagonist devi vishwakumar s maitreyi ramakrishnan father mohan sendhil ramamurthy suddenly dies and shortly after devi inexplicably loses the use of her legs this is all in the first few minutes as devi is starting to get used to life without her father and with her disability her mobility returns just as curiously as it left is the story of devi s attempt to return to a normal life and devi wants to return with a bang literally by losing her virginity to paxton hall yoshida darren barnet the hottest boy in school perhaps this might not strike you as a healthy thing for someone real or fictional to do that would be the point isn t just an indian american take on the coming of age story but also a story that takes teen rom com tropes and turns them into a vehicle for exploring grief none of this ever takes a backseat to s comedy or its earnest empathetic storytelling the show strives to keep its stakes small and focused on devi and her friends and family but they re surrounded by a cast of friends and family diverse and interesting enough to support a much bigger show while each character can t have a subplot of their own they re all afforded the potential for depth every character is going through something experiencing their foundational traumas in real time the central conflict of the show is devi s inability to see this slowly realizing that the process of dealing with her own extraordinary grief blinds her to what others are experiencing and that dealing with that grief poorly can also cost her the connections that will help her move on again is also a very good comedy that consistently delights there s clever and fun narration from tennis superstar john mcenroe there s a reason for this a bright danceable soundtrack that prominently features robyn s dancing on my own in the pilot and stays in that sonic milieu throughout and it features a cast of wonderfully charismatic young actors feels like what would have been a cult favorite in a previous generation of television a style one season wonder but times are very different now and an indian american lead is a refreshing change for this type of show especially one that might last ,everyone would many would opt unkind time collective much people new lang fisher take give new centering absolute one new show sunshine devi vishwakumar maitreyi ramakrishnan mohan sendhil ramamurthy devi inexplicably loses leg first devi get without disability mobility curiously devi devi bang losing virginity paxton hall yoshida darren barnet hottest perhaps might healthy someone would take also take none ever take backseat empathetic show strives keep devi enough much show subplot afforded every something experiencing foundational time show devi inability see others experiencing also move also tennis superstar mcenroe danceable prominently robyn dancing sonic milieu throughout like would one season time show one might last,2020-04-01,260,opt unkind collective lang fisher centering absolute sunshine devi vishwakumar maitreyi ramakrishnan mohan sendhil ramamurthy devi inexplicably loses leg devi disability mobility curiously devi devi bang losing virginity paxton hall yoshida darren barnet hottest healthy none backseat empathetic strives devi subplot afforded experiencing foundational devi inability experiencing tennis superstar mcenroe danceable prominently robyn dancing sonic milieu
31,"Superstardom isn’t what it used to be, but it can still bring us together",2020-04-27,Joshua Rivera,"On April 21st, CBS aired ,, a concert special recorded to commemorate the fourth anniversary of Prince’s death. Taped on January 28th, two days after the Grammys aired, the concert is immediately notable for being a throwback to our pre-pandemic world of live (at the time) entertainment. But our current , hasn’t just given , a new layer of relevance; it also amplified its intended purpose: highlighting how there is truly no artist like Prince and precious few pop culture icons that can capture the imagination of so many.,By now, we’re used to the way pop culture has fragmented along with our interests. Brands are bigger than stars, and few franchises — most of them owned by Disney — can reliably get the vast majority of the public talking. Shared experiences aren’t really extinct. We still have big-ticket sports broadcasts like the Super Bowl, viral sensations on streaming platforms like ,, and the occasional prestige series that generates a lot of buzz (like the first season of ,). They’re just rarer. ,But with our world in lockdown, pop culture is one of the only things we have left to share with others. The mass culture of the decades prior to the 21st century doesn’t exist anymore, so instead, we’re gathering around remembrances of it: iconic sports games like ,, celebratory concerts like ,, and, in ESPN’s ,about the life of Michael Jordan., is a particularly surreal thing to watch during lockdown. The 10-part documentary follows Jordan during his 1997–98 basketball season with the Chicago Bulls, which would be his last before his second retirement from the sport and his last season with the Bulls. Throughout, the series flashes back to the beginnings of Jordan’s life and career, and then forward to recent interviews with Jordan and those who knew him or followed his remarkable hoops journey (Including “former Chicago resident” Barack Obama).,As a documentary, , is kind of perfunctory, leaning heavily on the fact that Jordan was an unparalleled superstar with a level of fame that’s hard to grasp unless you lived through it. This point is easy to impress. In one memorable bit of archival news footage, a little girl tells a reporter that her parents said, “Do you want Christmas presents under the tree, or do you want to see Michael Jordan?” The implication, of course, is that she is , happy to pick “seeing Michael Jordan.” What kid wouldn’t spring at the chance to see the star of ,?, is similarly bare-bones: not terribly lavish and straightforward almost to a fault, the concert doesn’t do a lot of convincing because it really doesn’t need to. Prince just made damn good music that a lot of people loved, and watching St. Vincent, the Foo Fighters, Miguel, and Gary Clark Jr. cover that music is fun as hell — especially when you hear Dave Grohl say that Prince heard his band cover “Darling Nikki” once and did not like it at all. ,As the pandemic continues to reshape the world, it’s also underscoring the ways it already has been changed. Pop culture hasn’t really reflected that, mostly because it takes time for the things we’re processing in the real world to filter down into our entertainment. We’ve gotten a few glimpses of it, mostly in the compromises that have been made to make sure the show continues to go on in a socially distant fashion: movies , stars ,, interviews being ,.,Our entertainment has quickly adjusted to the new normal of the world, but the way that it reminds us of the old one remains awkward at best. In watching , or ,, we can remember another era in a way that lets us mourn what we lost and what we might never get back.

41,"New trailers: Snowpiercer, Normal People, The Innocence Files, and more",2020-04-04,Jacob Kastrenakes,"One of the few small upsides to the current global mess is that a bunch of movies are hitting streaming services and rental platforms earlier than they otherwise would have: ,, ,, and , are on that list, among many others. ,Another that’s now streaming early on Hulu is ,, which I caught last weekend. It’s a wonderful movie about two women slowly growing closer together over the course of about a week that they’re forced to spend together.,The movie revolves around painting, as the title suggests, but the film also does some really fascinating things with music. There are three moments in the movie where music plays, and in all three cases, you don’t see its origin (a piano, singers, an orchestra) until well after the music begins, if at all. It creates a very strange, untethered feeling. Is this sound really happening, or is it part of the score? There’s tension to simply figuring it out, and it adds an important, off-kilter element to a few particularly crucial scenes.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,TNT is turning , into a TV series, and so far it looks like it’ll be every bit as vibrant and violent as the movie adaptation.

Fifteen years later, it’s still one of the most enduring sitcoms because ,is an extraordinarily ordinary depiction of modern working life in America — well, it was. ,How jobs look has shifted radically over the last decade. The coronavirus pandemic simply sped up the circumstances for many industries. The gig economy is one of the biggest notable transitions. Uber, Lyft, Fiverr, Amazon Flex, and Airbnb didn’t exist 15 years ago when , premiered. Now, there are more than 55 million gig economy workers in the United States, , That’s more than 55 million people who don’t go into an office every day and share a kitchen with co-workers. Their idea of day-to-day work is already different from what ,presented. ,Before the pandemic forced us inside, ,was relatable. How does a workplace comedy operate without a workplace? Today, it feels like a piece of popular culture from eras past. Social distancing measures mean more people are working from home. Gags have shifted from pranking your deskmate to creating weird glitch art on Zoom using random anime backgrounds; hijinks in the shared kitchen turned into creating new Slack emoji to deliver a joke faster. ,Even those who aren’t in gig economy jobs are facing a time when physical offices aren’t necessary for most companies. Instant communication tools like Slack make talking with co-workers possible from anywhere, remote work is easy to do with an assortment of productivity services. Michael Scott’s outbursts in ,don’t transition well to Slack, where the equivalent is a message typed out in all-caps. That’s not as funny. ,Videoconferencing has also never been easier. Services like Zoom allow remote workers to talk face-to-face, all from the safety and comfort of their own homes. In December 2019, Zoom saw heights of 10 million daily users — by March 2020, Zoom was hitting “more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid,” ,“We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. ,Companies have transitioned quickly from operating in physical spaces to moving everything online. Zoom is hitting record-breaking numbers, as is Microsoft Teams, a group chat and collaboration tool from Microsoft that rivals Slack. Slack is no different. CEO Stewart Butterfield shared numbers in a lengthy tweet thread, noting that on Tuesday, March 10th, Slack’s concurrent users passed 10 million. That number jumped to 10.5 million just six days later, reaching 12.5 million on March 25th. ,“We have an incredible business that has been growing very quickly and that will continue to do so for many, many years to come,” Butterfield told Slack employees, as seen in ,. “We provide a platform that is going to become even more useful to the world in the years to come.” ,This pandemic will forever change parts of our lives, much like the 1918 influenza did more than 100 years ago. A big part of that will be the physicality of work. “The age of the office as we know it is probably over, and the bell can’t be unrung,” Matt Burr, CEO at Nomadic Learning, ,. More employees, once ready to commute into an office every day, will use tools like Slack and Zoom to work from home more often, according to Burr. Companies will see less of a reason to have physical space and will use remote advantages to build teams in different cities. ,Work has changed, and television will follow. Pop culture has always reflected our lives at a certain moment in time. Similar to how we revisit ,or ,to scratch the nostalgic itch for times when families were corny and homely or marathoning shows like ,and ,to reminisce about a time when people actually hung out, ,yearns for simpler times. Actress Angela Kinsey (who played Angela Martin on the show) described the series as inexplicably comforting. That comfort comes from the normalcy of a work routine — something I’ve come to miss in the weeks I’ve been at home. ,Less than 20 years ago, people worked in offices. Now, many of us work from home. Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein, co-producers on ,, are developing a new workplace comedy, but this one won’t include characters like Dwight and Jim throwing pencils at each other over their computers. Instead, the show is about a “wunderkind boss who, in an effort to ensure his staff’s connectedness and productivity, asks them all to virtually interact and work face-to-face all day,” , ,We’ve walked toward this change in work culture for years, but now it’s here for millions of people. The pandemic didn’t suddenly flip a switch; it proved that people can — and will — work without an office. Last year, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 26 million Americans, or approximately 16 percent of the total workforce, work from home. Imagine if half of ,’s cast suddenly stopped showing up because they could conduct calls at home and check in with co-workers online. Between 2005 and 2015, employees who telecommuted rose by 115 percent, the bureau reported.,Those years also happen to represent ,s run. As ,went off the air, so did the idea that day-to-day work would look the same as it did in 2005. More than 55 million people are gig workers who don’t have offices to go to, more people are set to work from home than ever, and an entire generation of employees may not experience that type of work setting — one considered universal less than 20 years ago. That’s the future pop culture will incorporate. There’s something poetic about ,’s co-producers being some of the first to try. ,“Start with the office comedy, lose the office and you’re just left with comedy,” co-producer Lieberstein told ,. “The

44,Tiger King is a viral success because Netflix rules the jungle,2020-04-03,Julia Alexander,"Even if people haven’t seen ,, Eric Goode’s seven-part documentary series about , (lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, and cougars to name a few), they’ve probably heard of it. , is unavoidable. It’s trending on TikTok, memes are all over Facebook and Twitter, and it’s sat in Netflix’s Top 10 spot — in the United States, Canada, Britain, and more countries around the world — for more than a week. Not even ,could dethrone it.,is so inherently buck wild that even if everything in the world these last few weeks was normal, it would likely find an audience. Now people are forced to stay indoors, turning to streamers like Netflix for constant entertainment day and night. Between March 9th and March 23rd, viewing on streaming services between 10AM and 5PM increased nearly 40 percent, according to a new report from streaming analyst firm Conviva that was shared with ,. Everyone from Netflix to Disney Plus and HBO Now ,, with global streaming growing 20 percent in the same time, but Netflix is one of the only global options.  ,Television, when executed properly, can do more than just entertain. It can provide an escape for people trying to forget reality, and it can create a sense of community. Much of the time, that community is borne out of live TV. Sports games, competition reality shows, or season finales lead to people coming together on Twitter or Facebook to watch together. Even if watching TV is an isolated activity, people can feel like they’re a part of something because everyone is watching at the same time. ,That’s disappeared. Every ,; ,; and season finales have been postponed because production units around the world shut down. The only live TV available to people is the news, and that doesn’t provide any escapism. Netflix was never invested in live TV. Executives have reiterated they don’t want to be in that space. ,,,with its instant meme-making moments and its availability to more than 167 million subscribers, gives Netflix an advantage in a world where live TV has all but diminished. ,isn’t comfort TV, but it does create a feeling of being part of a moment — something that people might be looking for more of lately as isolation continues.

Having something new to watch, especially on a streamer that many people might consider a primary platform, feels like a luxury. ,It’s abundantly clear from chatter on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok that ,is the first viral TV show during this lockdown period.

45,Tales from the Loop turns small-town America into a sci-fi feelings machine,2020-04-06,Joshua Rivera,"is so pretty it breaks your heart. Based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, famous for his scenes of pastoral tranquility draped around uncanny sci-fi sights, ,’s newest drama is a collection of eight short stories where everyday rural life is tinged with the supernatural. But unlike, say, ,, where the otherworldly takes center stage, , uses it as an excuse to dig deeper into the people who must continue to live mundane lives, even as the extraordinary looms just inches away. ,While , features a recurring cast of characters and overlapping plots, each episode functions as a standalone short story. Since critics were sent three out-of-order episodes for review, it’s safe to assume that continuity isn’t really a concern for the show; just consider it , with every episode set in the same town. ,And what a town it is! The series takes place in a fictional Ohio neighborhood built above The Loop, a machine built to “explore the mysteries of the universe.” The Loop is massive, and, while it employs most of the residents who live above it, few know the full extent of what goes on within its confines. All they know is that the work done there has changed the texture of their lives. Some of these changes are overt and intentional, like advances in technology that make robotic limbs, hovering tractors, and walking mechs commonplace. ,Other phenomena are less intentional: strange, inexplicable sightings; objects that appear out of thin air; fluctuations in space and time. In the ecosystem of this small Midwestern town, The Loop is an invasive exotic, reshaping the balance of life and nature around it. And everyone there has to just roll with it because they have no choice. Besides, sometimes The Loop has its benefits. ,In the episodes provided in advance, a girl’s mother disappears and leaves behind a strange artifact in “Loop,” a boy hears voices coming from a strange globe in “Echo Sphere,” and in “Parallel,” a man stumbles into another universe. What follows each is a tender drama that feels like a play, each devoted mostly to loneliness. ,Each character, at least in the episodes screened, yearns for connection. While “Loop” is set in motion by a disappearance, it’s really about distance, as the girl’s search for her missing parent serves as a window into how they became strangers to each other. “Parallel” shows a man meeting himself in another universe, but it chooses character drama over genre thrills as the two versions of the same man attempt to befriend one another. Over and over, , gestures at some inarticulate sadness and shows its characters trying to work through it. ,It’s not that big of a stretch from Stålenhag’s art, which is overwhelmingly melancholic in the way it juxtaposes the mundane and the fantastic. Transposed from its original Swedish context to an American one, that sorrow takes on new wrinkles. The Loop puts boundless potential literally within arm’s length of small-town Ohio, and yet, its denizens lead more or less the same lives they’d live without it. People still work in what seem like dead-end jobs, they have trouble tilling their fields, they don’t see their families enough. Through the eyes of a set of acclaimed directors — Ti West, Charlie McDowell, So Yong Kim, and Mark Romanek each helm an episode — every moment feels delicate and human, and despair never overwhelms wonder. ,is an understated work in a time when more muted stories are easily swallowed up in the wealth of available options. It’s worth making the time for, though. These are slow stories about how technology was never going to fix us no matter how promising it seems. We still have to go the slow route and try to fill the void in ourselves by reaching out to others.

46,"Quibi’s shows are fun, familiar, and a little forgettable",2020-04-06,Joshua Rivera,"It’s far too easy to make fun of Quibi. That’s the first problem. You can start with the name: an overly cute mashup of “quick bites.” It’s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to — hence a bizarre , dedicated to explaining it. It’s Netflix, but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt, yet brief enough that you wouldn’t turn to anything but your phone. You know: waiting in lines, pausing to sip a coffee, sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something. That’s Quibi’s second problem: it was created for a world that doesn’t really exist anymore, one put on hold by a pandemic. ,This makes Quibi a harder sell. TV to watch while you’re doing something else doesn’t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on. However, the contrary can , be true: we’re all staring at our phones anyway, so what’s another reason to do it some more? As of today, there are 24 reasons, each Quibi show delivered in installments of 10 minutes or less, each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream. There are 72 snacks in search of a meal.,The content — normally a crass word for art but an apt one for Quibi — runs the gamut, with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven’t really seen before. There’s a , revival starring Chance the Rapper, a series called , where Offset is really into cars and car stunts, a remake of ,starring Liam Hemsworth, and ,, a truly bizarre show where Will Arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the YouTube clip yourself. ,(,The Verg,Polygon,Verge,.),Quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone; almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations. I checked this, incessantly, with every show I watched. There’s something mind-boggling about it, the way Quibi tries to have things literally both ways. It works well enough, but there are strange side effects. In scripted shows, the dual-composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time, and that can make a serious drama feel shallow. In unscripted shows, this adds a layer of uncanniness, as slick network production clashes with a visual composition that’s thoroughly associated with influencers and lo-fi meme makers. You can, ironically, gauge how good a Quibi show is by how well it plays in vertical orientation. ,The majority of Quibi’s programming is the sort of stuff you can find on regular TV, just broken up into smaller pieces. , is a reality show in the vein of , in seven-minute chunks. , , feels like a USA drama, delivered one plot development at a time. , actually , a TV show long before Quibi, but someone figured it might play better if you didn’t have to spend 30 minutes with it. (They were right.) ,Quibi’s best shows are the ones that feel most like they could only happen on Quibi. There’s not a lot of that in the launch lineup, but perhaps the best example is ,, a ,-style courtroom show in which Chrissy Teigen is a courtroom judge mediating exclusively petty disputes, like who got someone a better Lizzo-themed sweater. It’s the perfect Quibi show — like a TikTok that got a little out of hand, but it ends just before it stops being funny. ,Another, ,, features comedians Matt Rogers and Dave Mizzoni as hosts in a competition. In every episode, two different straight men will compete to see who is the better queer ally. Again, it’s a bit that’s perfectly pitched for the platform. It’s savvy and effective, with stunts loud enough to hold your attention and talent deft enough to keep it. (It also might be the most genuinely funny show on Quibi so far.),Documentaries also fare pretty well on Quibi. The standout is ,, about LeBron James’ I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, which serves at-risk children with an approach that’s equal parts social work and education. Compelling, frank, and moving, each eight-minute installment absolutely flies by. ,Still, there’s a frivolousness to Quibi that none of its programming can seem to shake because the platform was built for frivolity. I could put on a Quibi show and keep up with it just fine while writing a grocery list, chopping garlic, or brushing my teeth and only glancing at it. Once, I almost put on a Quibi show while watching something else on my TV. ,For this reason, Quibi’s best point of comparison is podcasts, not streaming TV. It’s a medium for filling space that you probably already had filled with something else, but for some reason, you got it in your head that you should be , something in that time. It exists in a nebulous space between the steady dopamine rush of TikTok’s constant supply of novelty and the chill, lackadaisical time-sink of Twitch. Boredom is the constant, and it’s most often resolved by habit. This then, is the platform’s biggest ask: can you change your habits to accommodate it?,Because Quibi is designed to be habitual. New episodes are scheduled to drop every day, and new shows will premiere “every single Monday,” per Quibi. It’s a steady stream of quick bites coming from an endless bag of treats. Even in a world shut down by circumstance, Quibi is an interesting idea, one that wants us to use our phones the way we already do, like fidget spinners with Wi-Fi or a smoke break we can take anywhere. But that’s the third problem: no one remembers a snack. They remember a really good dinner. ",it s far too easy to make fun of quibi that s the first problem you can start with the name an overly cute mashup of quick bites it s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to hence a bizarre

51,"The Good Fight can and will do anything to get your attention, and it’s damn good at it",2020-04-10,Joshua Rivera,"One of the benefits of having a TV show on a streaming platform is something few actually take advantage of: you can more or less do anything. Freed from the shackles of broadcast ratings, once a streaming show is greenlit for a season, it’s basically guaranteed that season. ,, a legal drama on CBS All Access, has spent three years playing by no rules other than its own, upending everything you might expect from a legal drama to become one of the most slept-on shows out there. Its season 4 premiere, out this week, is the series at its most absurd and most incisive. ,To understand ,’s audacity, you have to know where it comes from. The first episode of , began with the Trump presidency. The show, a legal drama spun out of , (you don’t really need to watch that to enjoy this one) leaned into this. Its first scene featured protagonist Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a wealthy, successful lawyer, watching the inauguration and swearing. Then, she makes plans: she quits her job and makes preparations to run off to Italy, where she can ignore the looming political carnival. Things don’t go as planned, and she’s stuck here with the rest of us — her money gone, her former firm shutting her out, and her old way of life upended. ,She’s hired by a law firm owned by black partners, and , turns its premise on its head. Instead of being a story about a wealthy white woman dealing with Trump’s America, it’s about her confronting just how different that America is — and always was — for people of color. ,Perhaps that makes the series sound didactic, like it’s serving civic vegetables. And while it’s cathartic to see the writers handle topical issues like ICE’s lack of accountability or the consequences of a record number of barely qualified judges being approved by Congress, , is also unbelievably ,. Like any good courtroom drama, its cases are full of moves and countermoves that make each episode feel like a dance, and it’s frequently laugh-out-loud funny. One of the most memorable characters is Roland Blum (Michael Sheen), and amoral, fentanyl-sucking sleaze who blows through the show’s universe like a dirtbag hurricane that feels too cartoonish to be true. Then you notice he appears in an episode called “The One Inspired by Roy Cohn” and realize that he is, in fact, inspired by Roy Cohn. ,At its best, ,’s jokes always have a little bite. ,Take this season premiere as an example. In a completely out-of-nowhere twist, Diane wakes up to find she is in another universe where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, and she’s the only one who remembers the timeline where Trump did. Again, I must stress that ,is a legal drama. It does , dabble in science fiction or the multiverse or alternate timelines. And yet, that’s what the premiere does because , decided it had to make a point, one that it maybe didn’t underline well enough in previous episodes and one that feels especially resonant in an election year: the problems do not begin and end with the person in the White House. People have blind spots. , excels at satire that is both over-the-top and incredibly sharp — a talent that has made it the first truly good series about the Trump era, even as it continues to unfold. It’s a show that’s not afraid to be ridiculous in an effort to underscore the absurdity of the times, while affixing its drama to underappreciated stories ripped from headlines that the news cycle glosses over all too quickly. The thread tying this season together, for example, involves a top-secret memo that allows the rich to completely opt out of the legal process, a plotline clearly lifted from last year’s long line of Trump associates who simply refused to comply with subpoenas — a criminal offense. ,But perhaps the biggest reason ,resonates is in how it takes advantage of its case-of-the-week structure to continually widen its lens to look at how the systemic corruption of the judicial system is felt by people beyond its world of lawyers, who, by nature of their profession, must continually compromise. Sometimes it falters in this, reflecting the blindspots of the characters it usually is self-aware about. One season gets a little too mired in a #Resist plot, and in another, the , pee tape appears. (Yes, , pee tape. What other one could we possibly be talking about?),Yet, on the whole, , doesn’t want the rich and powerful to be the only ones writing the story of our surreal, nightmarish present.

52,What We Do in the Shadows is a vampire comedy about being stuck at home,2020-04-20,Joshua Rivera,"There’s something soothing about watching a bunch of vampires be absolute morons on television every week.

And yet, the bloodsucking clowns of , are so very bad at being immortal monsters, which means they are excellent at comedy. ,FX’s TV series, based on the Taika Waititi film of the same name, returned for a second season just as funny as ever. Like the movie, the show follows a trio of vampires — this time, they live on Staten Island as opposed to the New Zealand of the films — living together in a derelict old manor. Nandor (Kayvan Novak), Laszlo (Matt Berry), and Nadja (Natasia Demetriou) are hundreds of years old and also total dorks. They’re bad at most things they do, but as long as they don’t accidentally stumble into sunlight or fall on a wooden stake, they’ll get over it. (It turns out, vampirism is a very potent form of failing upward.),While this is extremely similar to the movie it’s based on, the TV version of , fleshes out its mockumentary antics with a few additions to the formula: namely, a familiar, Guillermo (Harvey Guillén) who serves them in hopes of becoming a vampire, and Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch), an “energy vampire” who looks normal but feeds off the ambient misery of everyone around him. ,Colin and Guillermo are the reason , works as a show, two regular-looking dudes juxtaposed against their goth reality show roommates that also have their own normcore sociopathic tendencies. Colin, in particular, gives the show a feeling very similar to ,As an energy vampire, he feeds off everyone’s annoyance and goes out of his way to be obnoxiously corny and irritating. (One very good Colin bit involves him incessantly saying “updog” as if it were a joke no one had ever heard before.),Like the best work of show creator Jemaine Clement (who co-wrote the film with Waititi), there’s a lot of fun to be had with taking the iconography of the occult and supernatural and putting them in front of the mundanity of the mockumentary. What happens when they’re haunted by a very petty ghost? Or deal with animal control when it captures one of them in bat form? Or accidentally get a pet zombie? ,Watching , is oddly cathartic while social distancing. Maybe it’s because the vampires of the show are also isolated in a fashion, unable to see the sunlight and absolutely kooky as a result. Maybe, , argues, immortality wouldn’t make you cool or fearsome, but instead really freaking weird. In that way, it’s kind of like watching a reality show about patently awful people. Maybe you have your flaws, but hey: you’re not that bad!,If you’ve spent any of the last month on Twitter, the corniest social network, you might have noticed a meme going around where people ask each other to pick their preferred “quarantine house.” Simply put, the tweets list groups of people, real or fictional, and asks which set you would like to shack up with while social distancing. Like all bad memes, there’s very little logic to them other than asking people to argue for the poster’s amusement, and this makes them consistently unfunny — at least until the lists get so baffling that the meme loops around to becoming funny again.,It’s a bad meme, but it’s one that feels appropriate for understanding why , is so fun to watch. Like in this silly Twitter exercise, , in their right mind would probably want to share a home with a bunch of vampires. But after watching ,why not? It could be fun. I wouldn’t recommend vampirism as a quarantine hobby, but being weirder? Sure. We could stand to be a little weirder.

to as an energy vampire he feeds off everyone s annoyance and goes out of his way to be obnoxiously corny and irritating one very good colin bit involves him incessantly saying updog as if it were a joke no one had ever heard before like the best work of show creator jemaine clement who co wrote the film with waititi there s a lot of fun to be had with taking the iconography of the occult and supernatural and putting them in front of the mundanity of the mockumentary what happens when they re haunted by a very petty ghost or deal with animal control when it captures one of them in bat form or accidentally get a pet zombie watching is oddly cathartic while social distancing maybe it s because the vampires of the show are also isolated in a fashion unable to see the sunlight and absolutely kooky as a result maybe argues immortality wouldn t make you cool or fearsome but instead really freaking weird in that way it s kind of like watching a reality show about patently awful people maybe you have your flaws but hey you re not that bad if you ve spent any of the last month on twitter the corniest social network you might have noticed a meme going around where people ask each other to pick their preferred quarantine house simply put the tweets list groups of people real or fictional and asks which set you would like to shack up with while social distancing like all bad memes there s very little logic to them other than asking people to argue for the poster s amusement and this makes them consistently unfunny at least until the lists get so baffling that the meme loops around to becoming funny again it s a bad meme but it s one that feels appropriate for understanding why is so fun to watch like in this silly twitter exercise in their right mind would probably want to share a home with a bunch of vampires but after watching why not it could be fun i wouldn t recommend vampirism as a quarantine hobby but being weirder sure we could stand to be a little

55,Mrs. America shows why the implosion of the Equal Rights Amendment still haunts us today  ,2020-04-17,Joshua Rivera,"In American politics, the Equal Rights Amendment is among one of the quieter embarrassments in United States history, a proposed legislation that, incredibly, has never been passed. Asserting that equality under the law not be denied on the basis of sex, the ERA has spent nearly 100 years in limbo. First introduced by activists in 1921, nearly passing in the 1970s, and finding ,, the struggle over the amendment slowly became a long-simmering culture war that remains unfortunately relevant.,, the new FX series streaming exclusively on Hulu, is the story of why it fell apart and the woman who made it happen. A nine-episode limited series, the show largely follows Phyllis Schlafly, the notorious conservative activist who discovered her calling in founding the STOP ERA movement and whose rhetoric helped successfully brand feminism with the cartoonishly angry stereotype that persists to this day. ,In the series, Schlafly, who died in 2016 (after publishing a book in support of Donald Trump), is a master of spin. Early in the show, ,illustrates how STOP ERA began to gain traction when the group started to sway politicians with bread and pies. Baked goods weren’t the only trick in STOP ERA’s arsenal, however. With Schlafly at the lead, the group argued that the ERA would rescind what they said were freedoms and protections for women under the current law: the freedom to be a housewife and raise children unconcerned with the stress of breadwinning, or the assurance that women wouldn’t or shouldn’t be drafted for the armed services. ,Portrayed by Cate Blanchett in a performance that’s a guaranteed Emmy nomination, Schlafly is the center of the story, but hers isn’t the only one ,is telling. The series also delves into the women’s movement opposite Schlafly, the leaders of which would form the National Women’s Political Caucus as a wave of popular support made the ERA seem like it was within reach of becoming the law of the land.  ,The constellation of characters consists of names most with a passing familiarity with feminist history might recognize: Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman), Flo Kennedy (Niecy Nash), Bella Abzug (,), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba), and Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne). While each episode of , is ostensibly centered on a different character, those characters are always in orbit around Schlafly. This feels like a necessary evil. , spans most of the 1970s, and Schlafly is singularly driven throughout the decade, while her opponents come from all walks of life with varied priorities. It also feels like a missed opportunity.,This comes to light most clearly in the series’s third episode, “Shirley,” which follows Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and the first black candidate to mount a presidential campaign. Specifically, it details the days leading up to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Chisholm’s campaign ended and she was pressured to release her delegates to the preferred candidate, George McGovern, without any concessions in exchange. ,In “Shirley,” , deftly fills in the spaces between the broad strokes of history, illustrating the internal disagreements in the movement as well as external forces opposing it. “Shirley,” and episodes beyond it, depict moments where experienced political movers tell activists what is or isn’t possible, where the concerns of the marginalized are often the first discarded, despite their efforts to bring the wider movement to where it is. ,Unfortunately, ,lacks the room to delve as deeply into this, as the breadth of the moment is often subject to the gravitational pull of Schlafly’s story. Again, some of this is necessary and even addressed by the show. The ERA organizers, in discussing their infighting, note that Schlafly and her STOP ERA team have one message and want one thing, while the women’s movement is concerned with a large platform of positions that are often argued over. But the show is also more interested in Schlafly, with every episode a new chapter in her slow development from ambitious political hopeful to one of the disingenuous and shrewd voices that helped build the framework for our ,. ,It’s a work that tries to understand a complicated, interesting woman but never quite finds an answer it believes. , looks at the life of Schlafly and mostly finds tragic irony: that a woman could do so much to overthrow a cause while being exemplary of that cause and that she could do more work on the ground to advance the birth of the modern conservative movement and be wholly shut out from holding any real power in it. In the show — ,—  Schlafly is accused of being the very kind of feminist she warred against, and it’s the argument , seems to agree with most. ,This informs its more , — Schlafly’s arc in , is one of ambition, not identity. What Schlafly , believes isn’t as important as what she thinks she deserves, and it’s because of this that the less palatable aspects of her biography — including alleged support by the Ku Klux Klan or the racism of her supporters — while not unmentioned, are only depicted in passing. Pivotal scenes where Schlafly begins to cross ethical lines begin to center themselves on Alice Macray (Sarah Paulson), a fictional character who eventually finds herself at odds with Schlafly — just as, it’s implied, any other reasonable woman would.,Perhaps that’s what’s most frustrating about ,In revisiting the efforts of the women’s liberation movement of the ‘70s, there , good parallels to the politics of today. It illustrates the way a lack of intersectionality can undermine movements that benefit everyone, the ease with which the disingenuous conservative machine can mobilize in the face of progress, and how the efforts of people of color are easily forgotten in the interest of so-called pragmatism or the glamour of the white artists whose work is celebrated by the upper class. ,But , can’t quite come to grips with a reality that, by 2020, should be clear: to some Americans, the public affirmation of other identities, lifestyles, or creeds is perceived as hostile to their very existence. To some Americans, there are benefits that come with perceiving yourself as Christian or white or moral, and those benefits depend on the supremacy of that identity over others. More broadly, there are plenty of Americans who don’t consider themselves to be racist or bigoted but are happy to support the political campaigns of those who are or want to live in a world more accommodating of bigotry. From Jim Crow to STOP ERA to modern gerrymandering and voter suppression, regression is as big a part of our history as progress. ,, ironically, isn’t American enough.",in american politics the equal

But as the movie goes on, it rushes through so many of them, and I wish there was more time to linger.,What I think really holds , back, though, is the lack of a main character. Sure, we have Chris Evans leading us through the film... but who is he? What does he want? Why should we care?

It’s from Ryan Murphy, which means it’s filled with bright colors, beautiful people, and lots of style.

62,Netflix makes reality shows exclusively for the extremely online,2020-04-23,Joshua Rivera,"’s premise is hard to see as anything other than desperate. A collection of hot people are promised a hedonistic island getaway, then surprised with a big catch: a $100,000 prize, but only if they abstain from having sex. As a group of mostly accomplished sex-havers who meet each other in swimwear, this is the opposite of what they want, and the show doesn’t , expect them to not hook up; they’ll just lose some prize money every time they get too horny. Whether or not the show is good doesn’t really matter, because like all of Netflix’s 2020 reality shows, it was made to go viral — and quality doesn’t really matter for that. A successful Netflix reality show isn’t about being entertaining. It’s about being online. ,, Netflix’s first reality show of 2020, was also the most openly interested in figuring out how to bring digital life into an easily digestible reality competition. It did this by simply making social media the point, telling its contestants that they would only ever interact with each other through the show’s eponymous social network, The Circle. Because of this, they could be whoever they wanted to be. Some participants chose to stick to who they really were; others took a more ,-style approach by playing as someone else entirely.,It was a reality competition about the , — the internet in a nutshell, presented in a bingeable reality series. It’s also an easily exportable one. Currently, there’s a version of ,for the United Kingdom, Brazil, and France. These regional adaptations might as well underline the point: the internet can be a culture unto itself, a medium where personas are invented and rebuilt daily regardless of their physical circumstance. ,, Netflix’s second reality show this year, narrowed its lens to focus on dating. Like ,, it’s a potent fusion of the heightened personalities fostered by both reality television and life online. In it, contestants are divided by gender (,is cripplingly heteronormative) and kept apart, going on literal blind dates in pods where they can hear, but not see each other. It’s a mode of interaction more intimate than, say, Tinder, but still fraught with some of the same anxieties: in a world where anyone can present themselves in any way they choose, how do you know what’s genuine? ,As ,ups the stakes — to proceed in the “experiment” (as the show calls itself), couples must get engaged, sight unseen — the series takes a very online concern to Bravo-esque heights of surrealism. Couples with only a handful of conversations under their belt meet each others’ families, prepare for a wedding, and try to not second-guess their relationship now that they can hang out with other contestants. In juxtaposing participants’ initial isolation with the messiness of reality television, it takes on a common theme with ,: consistency as authenticity. ,The couples , gets the most mileage out of are the ones who dependably lean into their broad archetype; even if their personas do not appear genuine. While not a competition, there are heroes (the sincere and sweet Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed) and villains (the vain and superficial Matthew Barnett and Amber Pike). As other couples fall to the wayside, , becomes an endurance test to see if your chosen (or, given the genre we’re dealing with, assigned) persona holds, wringing drama from moments where masks look like they may slip. It’s telling that for Hamilton and Speed, the show never really ended — the two have leveraged their newfound fame ,.,That consistency brings us back to ,, the newest and shallowest show in Netflix’s growing reality TV empire. Unlike the other shows, which sort its characters ,style into various archetypes, ,’s cast mostly falls on a scale that goes from selfish to horny, or selfish and horny, and counts on that to be enough. The cynicism of the enterprise makes for a show that barely seems like it should even hold together. It’s hosted by a smart speaker named Lana that looks like ,, there’s a narrator who provides commentary that barely makes sense, and it’s all tied together with halfhearted moralizing messages about how contestants might learn there is more to love than sex. ,Yet it doesn’t really matter because, again: this is about being online, except that, unlike Netflix’s other reality shows, it’s not interested in people. It gives its contestants almost zero opportunities to slide from person to performance, everyone involved is only as interesting as their last Instagram (and whether they will succumb and have sex). It’s the internet as pure consumption and not creation. ,To those who lead an online life, it’s no secret that performance lies at the heart of it. This is why “catfish” is a verb and not just the title of a movie / TV show, why YouTubers and live-streamers foster ,, and why we’ve developed a nigh-innate ability to decipher what’s implied by the angle, background, and framing of a given Instagram post. We know that posting does not make a person, so we decide on a case-by-case basis if the posts are good enough to connect with on their own merit, or if we’d rather see a person on the other end of the screen. ,That Netflix’s reality programming would take on a uniquely online texture shouldn’t be terribly surprising. In terms of ubiquity and traffic, ,, accounting for an astonishing amount of time and bandwidth. Just as reality television emerged on cable and broadcast to present a , populated by , that gamified small-screen fame, it’s being reinvented on Netflix for our extremely online world. If Netflix’s reality shows seem a little more ridiculous than what came before, it’s because they are: the ante has been upped, and reality television is no longer about “normal” people competing against scripted dramas and comedies. ,Now, the whole internet is the network, and everyone with a smartphone is competition. Going viral could happen to you, so why would you watch someone else striving for small-scale fame? Unless, of course, they’re reckless enough to try something like, say, moving into a building full of potential catfish where their only communication was a fake social network. Or marry someone they’d never get to see until they proposed. Or completely ruin a small team of aspiring influencer’s chances at winning money because you cannot keep your hands off each other. That might work. It might be enough to get people to stop posting about their own lives for long enough to post about a few lives sponsored by Netflix.
