5,Mindy Kaling’s new teen sitcom Never Have I Ever is an empathetic exploration of grief,2020-05-01,Joshua Rivera,"If you told everyone exactly how high school would play out, odds are many would opt the hell out. High school in America is a bizarre and unkind time, a collective coming-of-age story that has as much room for variety as there are people who go through it. ,, a new Netflix sitcom from , creator Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher, takes the broad strokes of high school and gives them new life by centering its story on an Indian-American girl. It’s an absolute delight, one of the most pleasant new binge-watches you can do right now. ,That doesn’t mean the show is all sunshine — , begins with a tragedy when protagonist Devi Vishwakumar’s (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) father Mohan (Sendhil Ramamurthy) suddenly dies, and shortly after, Devi inexplicably loses the use of her legs. (This is all in the first few minutes). As Devi is starting to get used to life without her father and with her disability, her mobility returns, just as curiously as it left. , is the story of Devi’s attempt to return to a normal life, and Devi wants to return with a bang — literally, by losing her virginity to Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet) the hottest boy in school. ,Perhaps this might not strike you as a healthy thing for someone, real or fictional, to do. That would be the point: , isn’t just an Indian-American take on the coming-of-age story, but also a story that takes teen rom-com tropes and turns them into a vehicle for exploring grief. None of this ever takes a backseat to ,’s comedy or its earnest, empathetic storytelling. The show strives to keep its stakes small and focused on Devi and her friends and family, but they’re surrounded by a cast of friends and family diverse and interesting enough to support a much bigger show. ,While each character can’t have a subplot of their own, they’re all afforded the potential for depth. Every character is going through something, experiencing their foundational traumas in real time. The central conflict of the show is Devi’s inability to see this, slowly realizing that the process of dealing with her own extraordinary grief blinds her to what others are experiencing, and that dealing with that grief poorly can also cost her the connections that will help her move on. ,Again: ,is also a very good comedy that consistently delights. There’s clever and fun narration from tennis superstar John McEnroe (there’s a reason for this); a bright, danceable soundtrack that prominently features Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own” in the pilot and stays in that sonic milieu throughout; and it features a cast of wonderfully charismatic young actors. , feels like what would have been a cult favorite in a previous generation of television, a ,-style one-season wonder. But times are very different now, and an Indian-American lead is a refreshing change for this type of show — especially one that might last.",if you told everyone exactly how high school would play

42,The Office celebrates a work life that doesn’t exist anymore,2020-04-07,Julia Alexander,"The scenes that make ,special aren’t overly zany but are extremely relatable, like Dwight Schrute making an obnoxious sales call at his desk, while Jim and Pam roll their eyes at their colleague’s behavior. It happens almost every episode: two people, the stand-ins for the audience, acknowledging just how annoying the workplace is. ,is a show about the random, boring bits of everyday work life and the comedy that ensues from being surrounded by the same people on a daily basis. Employees sit at their desks, jokes are made, and snacks are munched on. Fifteen years later, it’s still one of the most enduring sitcoms because ,is an extraordinarily ordinary depiction of modern working life in America — well, it was. ,How jobs look has shifted radically over the last decade. The coronavirus pandemic simply sped up the circumstances for many industries. The gig economy is one of the biggest notable transitions. Uber, Lyft, Fiverr, Amazon Flex, and Airbnb didn’t exist 15 years ago when , premiered. Now, there are more than 55 million gig economy workers in the United States, , That’s more than 55 million people who don’t go into an office every day and share a kitchen with co-workers. Their idea of day-to-day work is already different from what ,presented. ,Before the pandemic forced us inside, ,was relatable. How does a workplace comedy operate without a workplace? Today, it feels like a piece of popular culture from eras past. Social distancing measures mean more people are working from home. Gags have shifted from pranking your deskmate to creating weird glitch art on Zoom using random anime backgrounds; hijinks in the shared kitchen turned into creating new Slack emoji to deliver a joke faster. ,Even those who aren’t in gig economy jobs are facing a time when physical offices aren’t necessary for most companies. Instant communication tools like Slack make talking with co-workers possible from anywhere, remote work is easy to do with an assortment of productivity services. Michael Scott’s outbursts in ,don’t transition well to Slack, where the equivalent is a message typed out in all-caps. That’s not as funny. ,Videoconferencing has also never been easier. Services like Zoom allow remote workers to talk face-to-face, all from the safety and comfort of their own homes. In December 2019, Zoom saw heights of 10 million daily users — by March 2020, Zoom was hitting “more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid,” ,“We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. ,Companies have transitioned quickly from operating in physical spaces to moving everything online. Zoom is hitting record-breaking numbers, as is Microsoft Teams, a group chat and collaboration tool from Microsoft that rivals Slack. Slack is no different. CEO Stewart Butterfield shared numbers in a lengthy tweet thread, noting that on Tuesday, March 10th, Slack’s concurrent users passed 10 million. That number jumped to 10.5 million just six days later, reaching 12.5 million on March 25th. ,“We have an incredible business that has been growing very quickly and that will continue to do so for many, many years to come,” Butterfield told Slack employees, as seen in ,. “We provide a platform that is going to become even more useful to the world in the years to come.” ,This pandemic will forever change parts of our lives, much like the 1918 influenza did more than 100 years ago. A big part of that will be the physicality of work. “The age of the office as we know it is probably over, and the bell can’t be unrung,” Matt Burr, CEO at Nomadic Learning, ,. More employees, once ready to commute into an office every day, will use tools like Slack and Zoom to work from home more often, according to Burr. Companies will see less of a reason to have physical space and will use remote advantages to build teams in different cities. ,Work has changed, and television will follow. Pop culture has always reflected our lives at a certain moment in time. Similar to how we revisit ,or ,to scratch the nostalgic itch for times when families were corny and homely or marathoning shows like ,and ,to reminisce about a time when people actually hung out, ,yearns for simpler times. Actress Angela Kinsey (who played Angela Martin on the show) described the series as inexplicably comforting. That comfort comes from the normalcy of a work routine — something I’ve come to miss in the weeks I’ve been at home. ,Less than 20 years ago, people worked in offices. Now, many of us work from home. Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein, co-producers on ,, are developing a new workplace comedy, but this one won’t include characters like Dwight and Jim throwing pencils at each other over their computers. Instead, the show is about a “wunderkind boss who, in an effort to ensure his staff’s connectedness and productivity, asks them all to virtually interact and work face-to-face all day,” , ,We’ve walked toward this change in work culture for years, but now it’s here for millions of people. The pandemic didn’t suddenly flip a switch; it proved that people can — and will — work without an office. Last year, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 26 million Americans, or approximately 16 percent of the total workforce, work from home. Imagine if half of ,’s cast suddenly stopped showing up because they could conduct calls at home and check in with co-workers online. Between 2005 and 2015, employees who telecommuted rose by 115 percent, the bureau reported.,Those years also happen to represent ,s run. As ,went off the air, so did the idea that day-to-day work would look the same as it did in 2005. More than 55 million people are gig workers who don’t have offices to go to, more people are set to work from home than ever, and an entire generation of employees may not experience that type of work setting — one considered universal less than 20 years ago. That’s the future pop culture will incorporate. There’s something poetic about ,’s co-producers being some of the first to try. ,“Start with the office comedy, lose the office and you’re just left with comedy,” co-producer Lieberstein told ,. “The math works.” ,In the meantime, many of us are at home, so lonely that we are wistfully streaming old episodes of ,, longing for the Dwight Schrutes in our lives, wishing they could do something annoying enough that we could turn to another colleague for just a moment and roll our eyes.",the scenes that make special aren t overly zany but are extremely relatable like dwight schrute making an

It can provide an escape for people trying to forget reality, and it can create a sense of community. Much of the time, that community is borne out of live TV.

45,Tales from the Loop turns small-town America into a sci-fi feelings machine,2020-04-06,Joshua Rivera,"is so pretty it breaks your heart. Based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, famous for his scenes of pastoral tranquility draped around uncanny sci-fi sights, ,’s newest drama is a collection of eight short stories where everyday rural life is tinged with the supernatural. But unlike, say, ,, where the otherworldly takes center stage, , uses it as an excuse to dig deeper into the people who must continue to live mundane lives, even as the extraordinary looms just inches away. ,While , features a recurring cast of characters and overlapping plots, each episode functions as a standalone short story. Since critics were sent three out-of-order episodes for review, it’s safe to assume that continuity isn’t really a concern for the show; just consider it , with every episode set in the same town. ,And what a town it is! The series takes place in a fictional Ohio neighborhood built above The Loop, a machine built to “explore the mysteries of the universe.” The Loop is massive, and, while it employs most of the residents who live above it, few know the full extent of what goes on within its confines. All they know is that the work done there has changed the texture of their lives. Some of these changes are overt and intentional, like advances in technology that make robotic limbs, hovering tractors, and walking mechs commonplace. ,Other phenomena are less intentional: strange, inexplicable sightings; objects that appear out of thin air; fluctuations in space and time. In the ecosystem of this small Midwestern town, The Loop is an invasive exotic, reshaping the balance of life and nature around it. And everyone there has to just roll with it because they have no choice. Besides, sometimes The Loop has its benefits. ,In the episodes provided in advance, a girl’s mother disappears and leaves behind a strange artifact in “Loop,” a boy hears voices coming from a strange globe in “Echo Sphere,” and in “Parallel,” a man stumbles into another universe. What follows each is a tender drama that feels like a play, each devoted mostly to loneliness. ,Each character, at least in the episodes screened, yearns for connection. While “Loop” is set in motion by a disappearance, it’s really about distance, as the girl’s search for her missing parent serves as a window into how they became strangers to each other. “Parallel” shows a man meeting himself in another universe, but it chooses character drama over genre thrills as the two versions of the same man attempt to befriend one another. Over and over, , gestures at some inarticulate sadness and shows its characters trying to work through it. ,It’s not that big of a stretch from Stålenhag’s art, which is overwhelmingly melancholic in the way it juxtaposes the mundane and the fantastic. Transposed from its original Swedish context to an American one, that sorrow takes on new wrinkles. The Loop puts boundless potential literally within arm’s length of small-town Ohio, and yet, its denizens lead more or less the same lives they’d live without it. People still work in what seem like dead-end jobs, they have trouble tilling their fields, they don’t see their families enough. Through the eyes of a set of acclaimed directors — Ti West, Charlie McDowell, So Yong Kim, and Mark Romanek each helm an episode — every moment feels delicate and human, and despair never overwhelms wonder. ,is an understated work in a time when more muted stories are easily swallowed up in the wealth of available options. It’s worth making the time for, though. These are slow stories about how technology was never going to fix us no matter how promising it seems. We still have to go the slow route and try to fill the void in ourselves by reaching out to others.

46,"Quibi’s shows are fun, familiar, and a little forgettable",2020-04-06,Joshua Rivera,"It’s far too easy to make fun of Quibi. That’s the first problem. You can start with the name: an overly cute mashup of “quick bites.” It’s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to — hence a bizarre , dedicated to explaining it. It’s Netflix, but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt, yet brief enough that you wouldn’t turn to anything but your phone. You know: waiting in lines, pausing to sip a coffee, sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something. That’s Quibi’s second problem: it was created for a world that doesn’t really exist anymore, one put on hold by a pandemic. ,This makes Quibi a harder sell. TV to watch while you’re doing something else doesn’t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on. However, the contrary can , be true: we’re all staring at our phones anyway, so what’s another reason to do it some more? As of today, there are 24 reasons, each Quibi show delivered in installments of 10 minutes or less, each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream. There are 72 snacks in search of a meal.,The content — normally a crass word for art but an apt one for Quibi — runs the gamut, with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven’t really seen before. There’s a , revival starring Chance the Rapper, a series called , where Offset is really into cars and car stunts, a remake of ,starring Liam Hemsworth, and ,, a truly bizarre show where Will Arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the YouTube clip yourself. ,(,The Verg,Polygon,Verge,.),Quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone; almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations. I checked this, incessantly, with every show I watched. There’s something mind-boggling about it, the way Quibi tries to have things literally both ways. It works well enough, but there are strange side effects. In scripted shows, the dual-composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time, and that can make a serious drama feel shallow. In unscripted shows, this adds a layer of uncanniness, as slick network production clashes with a visual composition that’s thoroughly associated with influencers and lo-fi meme makers. You can, ironically, gauge how good a Quibi show is by how well it plays in vertical orientation. ,The majority of Quibi’s programming is the sort of stuff you can find on regular TV, just broken up into smaller pieces. , is a reality show in the vein of , in seven-minute chunks. , , feels like a USA drama, delivered one plot development at a time. , actually , a TV show long before Quibi, but someone figured it might play better if you didn’t have to spend 30 minutes with it. (They were right.) ,Quibi’s best shows are the ones that feel most like they could only happen on Quibi. There’s not a lot of that in the launch lineup, but perhaps the best example is ,, a ,-style courtroom show in which Chrissy Teigen is a courtroom judge mediating exclusively petty disputes, like who got someone a better Lizzo-themed sweater. It’s the perfect Quibi show — like a TikTok that got a little out of hand, but it ends just before it stops being funny. ,Another, ,, features comedians Matt Rogers and Dave Mizzoni as hosts in a competition. In every episode, two different straight men will compete to see who is the better queer ally. Again, it’s a bit that’s perfectly pitched for the platform. It’s savvy and effective, with stunts loud enough to hold your attention and talent deft enough to keep it. (It also might be the most genuinely funny show on Quibi so far.),Documentaries also fare pretty well on Quibi. The standout is ,, about LeBron James’ I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, which serves at-risk children with an approach that’s equal parts social work and education. Compelling, frank, and moving, each eight-minute installment absolutely flies by. ,Still, there’s a frivolousness to Quibi that none of its programming can seem to shake because the platform was built for frivolity. I could put on a Quibi show and keep up with it just fine while writing a grocery list, chopping garlic, or brushing my teeth and only glancing at it. Once, I almost put on a Quibi show while watching something else on my TV. ,For this reason, Quibi’s best point of comparison is podcasts, not streaming TV. It’s a medium for filling space that you probably already had filled with something else, but for some reason, you got it in your head that you should be , something in that time. It exists in a nebulous space between the steady dopamine rush of TikTok’s constant supply of novelty and the chill, lackadaisical time-sink of Twitch. Boredom is the constant, and it’s most often resolved by habit. This then, is the platform’s biggest ask: can you change your habits to accommodate it?,Because Quibi is designed to be habitual. New episodes are scheduled to drop every day, and new shows will premiere “every single Monday,” per Quibi. It’s a steady stream of quick bites coming from an endless bag of treats. Even in a world shut down by circumstance, Quibi is an interesting idea, one that wants us to use our phones the way we already do, like fidget spinners with Wi-Fi or a smoke break we can take anywhere. But that’s the third problem: no one remembers a snack. They remember a really good dinner. ",it s far too easy to make fun of quibi that s the first problem you can start with the name an overly cute mashup of quick bites it s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to hence a bizarre dedicated to explaining it it s netflix but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt yet brief enough that you wouldn t turn to anything but your phone you know waiting in lines pausing to sip a coffee sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something that s quibi s second problem it was created for a world that doesn t really exist anymore one put on hold by a pandemic this makes quibi a harder sell tv to watch while you re doing something else doesn t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on however the contrary can be true we re all staring at our phones anyway so what s another reason to do it some more as of today there are reasons each quibi show delivered in installments of minutes or less each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream there are snacks in search of a meal the content normally a crass word for art but an apt one for quibi runs the gamut with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven t really seen before there s a revival starring chance the rapper a series called where offset is really into cars and car stunts a remake of starring liam hemsworth and a truly bizarre show where will arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the youtube clip yourself the verg polygon verge quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations i checked this incessantly with every show i watched there s something mind boggling about it the way quibi tries to have things literally both ways it works well enough but there are strange side effects in scripted shows the dual composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time and that can make a serious drama feel shallow in unscripted shows this adds a layer of uncanniness as slick network production clashes with a visual composition that s thoroughly associated with influencers and lo fi meme makers you can ironically gauge how good a

48,Netflix signs a first-look deal with Boom Studios for new comic book TV show adapations,2020-04-13,Chaim Gartenberg,"Netflix , a first-look deal with comics publisher Boom Studios for new TV series based on Boom’s comic book franchises, giving the streaming service another avenue for intellectual property based on which it can create new shows.,While not nearly as large as big-name publishers like Marvel, DC, or Image Comics, Boom Studios is still one of the most popular comic book companies in the world, producing major franchises like ,,,,,,,,,and ,.,With the new deal, Netflix gets access to a wealth of franchises and series from Boom’s original lineups to turn into new TV shows, something that Netflix badly needs in the increasingly tribalistic streaming wars.

49,"Zoom became Saturday Night Live’s breakout star in historic all-digital, remote episode ",2020-04-12,Julia Alexander,"“Live from Zoom, it’s ,” isn’t a phrase people ever assumed NBC’s quintessential late-night show would ever open with, but then again, most people likely weren’t using ,.,The breakout star of ,’s unprecedented remote episode was the video conferencing tool tens of millions of people are using while working from home. It wasn’t just a casual throwaway line in a sketch during ,’s most recent episode. It wasn’t just a venue where the show was filmed, standing in as a digital replacement for Studio 8H at 30 Rock in New York City. Zoom became a cast member in its own right as the ,team worked remotely to put together a 90-minute show for Saturday night.

Kate McKinnon included her cat. Pete Davidson filmed on his street in suburban Staten Island, in front of a house he shares with his mom. They used makeshift green screen backgrounds on Zoom for any kind of visual gag.

Heidi Gardner’s popular Weekend Update character, a Bailey, finally got to record an entire episode of her movie review show on YouTube. Mikey Day became a Twitch streamer who sucks at ,in another sketch. Aidy Bryant used different Zoom backgrounds to guide viewers on a meditation journey.

51,"The Good Fight can and will do anything to get your attention, and it’s damn good at it",2020-04-10,Joshua Rivera,"One of the benefits of having a TV show on a streaming platform is something few actually take advantage of: you can more or less do anything. Freed from the shackles of broadcast ratings, once a streaming show is greenlit for a season, it’s basically guaranteed that season. ,, a legal drama on CBS All Access, has spent three years playing by no rules other than its own, upending everything you might expect from a legal drama to become one of the most slept-on shows out there. Its season 4 premiere, out this week, is the series at its most absurd and most incisive. ,To understand ,’s audacity, you have to know where it comes from. The first episode of , began with the Trump presidency. The show, a legal drama spun out of , (you don’t really need to watch that to enjoy this one) leaned into this. Its first scene featured protagonist Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a wealthy, successful lawyer, watching the inauguration and swearing. Then, she makes plans: she quits her job and makes preparations to run off to Italy, where she can ignore the looming political carnival. Things don’t go as planned, and she’s stuck here with the rest of us — her money gone, her former firm shutting her out, and her old way of life upended. ,She’s hired by a law firm owned by black partners, and , turns its premise on its head. Instead of being a story about a wealthy white woman dealing with Trump’s America, it’s about her confronting just how different that America is — and always was — for people of color. ,Perhaps that makes the series sound didactic, like it’s serving civic vegetables. And while it’s cathartic to see the writers handle topical issues like ICE’s lack of accountability or the consequences of a record number of barely qualified judges being approved by Congress, , is also unbelievably ,. Like any good courtroom drama, its cases are full of moves and countermoves that make each episode feel like a dance, and it’s frequently laugh-out-loud funny. One of the most memorable characters is Roland Blum (Michael Sheen), and amoral, fentanyl-sucking sleaze who blows through the show’s universe like a dirtbag hurricane that feels too cartoonish to be true. Then you notice he appears in an episode called “The One Inspired by Roy Cohn” and realize that he is, in fact, inspired by Roy Cohn. ,At its best, ,’s jokes always have a little bite. ,Take this season premiere as an example. In a completely out-of-nowhere twist, Diane wakes up to find she is in another universe where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, and she’s the only one who remembers the timeline where Trump did. Again, I must stress that ,is a legal drama. It does , dabble in science fiction or the multiverse or alternate timelines. And yet, that’s what the premiere does because , decided it had to make a point, one that it maybe didn’t underline well enough in previous episodes and one that feels especially resonant in an election year: the problems do not begin and end with the person in the White House. People have blind spots. , excels at satire that is both over-the-top and incredibly sharp — a talent that has made it the first truly good series about the Trump era, even as it continues to unfold. It’s a show that’s not afraid to be ridiculous in an effort to underscore the absurdity of the times, while affixing its drama to underappreciated stories ripped from headlines that the news cycle glosses over all too quickly. The thread tying this season together, for example, involves a top-secret memo that allows the rich to completely opt out of the legal process, a plotline clearly lifted from last year’s long line of Trump associates who simply refused to comply with subpoenas — a criminal offense. ,But perhaps the biggest reason ,resonates is in how it takes advantage of its case-of-the-week structure to continually widen its lens to look at how the systemic corruption of the judicial system is felt by people beyond its world of lawyers, who, by nature of their profession, must continually compromise. Sometimes it falters in this, reflecting the blindspots of the characters it usually is self-aware about. One season gets a little too mired in a #Resist plot, and in another, the , pee tape appears. (Yes, , pee tape. What other one could we possibly be talking about?),Yet, on the whole, , doesn’t want the rich and powerful to be the only ones writing the story of our surreal, nightmarish present.

52,What We Do in the Shadows is a vampire comedy about being stuck at home,2020-04-20,Joshua Rivera,"There’s something soothing about watching a bunch of vampires be absolute morons on television every week.

55,Mrs. America shows why the implosion of the Equal Rights Amendment still haunts us today  ,2020-04-17,Joshua Rivera,"In American politics, the Equal Rights Amendment is among one of the quieter embarrassments in United States history, a proposed legislation that, incredibly, has never been passed. Asserting that equality under the law not be denied on the basis of sex, the ERA has spent nearly 100 years in limbo. First introduced by activists in 1921, nearly passing in the 1970s, and finding ,, the struggle over the amendment slowly became a long-simmering culture war that remains unfortunately relevant.,, the new FX series streaming exclusively on Hulu, is the story of why it fell apart and the woman who made it happen. A nine-episode limited series, the show largely follows Phyllis Schlafly, the notorious conservative activist who discovered her calling in founding the STOP ERA movement and whose rhetoric helped successfully brand feminism with the cartoonishly angry stereotype that persists to this day. ,In the series, Schlafly, who died in 2016 (after publishing a book in support of Donald Trump), is a master of spin. Early in the show, ,illustrates how STOP ERA began to gain traction when the group started to sway politicians with bread and pies. Baked goods weren’t the only trick in STOP ERA’s arsenal, however. With Schlafly at the lead, the group argued that the ERA would rescind what they said were freedoms and protections for women under the current law: the freedom to be a housewife and raise children unconcerned with the stress of breadwinning, or the assurance that women wouldn’t or shouldn’t be drafted for the armed services. ,Portrayed by Cate Blanchett in a performance that’s a guaranteed Emmy nomination, Schlafly is the center of the story, but hers isn’t the only one ,is telling. The series also delves into the women’s movement opposite Schlafly, the leaders of which would form the National Women’s Political Caucus as a wave of popular support made the ERA seem like it was within reach of becoming the law of the land.  ,The constellation of characters consists of names most with a passing familiarity with feminist history might recognize: Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman), Flo Kennedy (Niecy Nash), Bella Abzug (,), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba), and Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne). While each episode of , is ostensibly centered on a different character, those characters are always in orbit around Schlafly. This feels like a necessary evil. , spans most of the 1970s, and Schlafly is singularly driven throughout the decade, while her opponents come from all walks of life with varied priorities. It also feels like a missed opportunity.,This comes to light most clearly in the series’s third episode, “Shirley,” which follows Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and the first black candidate to mount a presidential campaign. Specifically, it details the days leading up to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Chisholm’s campaign ended and she was pressured to release her delegates to the preferred candidate, George McGovern, without any concessions in exchange. ,In “Shirley,” , deftly fills in the spaces between the broad strokes of history, illustrating the internal disagreements in the movement as well as external forces opposing it. “Shirley,” and episodes beyond it, depict moments where experienced political movers tell activists what is or isn’t possible, where the concerns of the marginalized are often the first discarded, despite their efforts to bring the wider movement to where it is. ,Unfortunately, ,lacks the room to delve as deeply into this, as the breadth of the moment is often subject to the gravitational pull of Schlafly’s story. Again, some of this is necessary and even addressed by the show. The ERA organizers, in discussing their infighting, note that Schlafly and her STOP ERA team have one message and want one thing, while the women’s movement is concerned with a large platform of positions that are often argued over.

rights amendment is among one of the quieter embarrassments in united states history a proposed legislation that incredibly has never been passed asserting that equality under the law not be denied on the basis of sex the era has spent nearly years in limbo first introduced by activists in nearly passing in the s and finding the struggle over the amendment slowly became a long simmering culture war

gain traction when the group started to sway politicians with bread and pies baked goods weren t the only trick in stop era s arsenal however with schlafly at the lead the group argued that the era would rescind what they said were freedoms and protections for women under the current law the freedom to be a housewife and raise children unconcerned with the stress of breadwinning or the assurance that women wouldn t or shouldn t be drafted for the armed services portrayed by cate blanchett in a performance that s a guaranteed emmy nomination schlafly is the center of the story but hers isn t

always in orbit around schlafly this feels like a necessary evil spans most of the s and schlafly is singularly driven throughout the decade while her opponents come from all walks of life with varied priorities it also feels like a missed opportunity this comes to light most clearly in the series s third episode shirley which follows chisholm the first black woman elected to congress and the first black candidate to mount a presidential campaign specifically it details the days leading up to the democratic national convention where chisholm s campaign ended and she was pressured to release her delegates to the preferred candidate george mcgovern without any concessions in exchange in shirley deftly fills in the spaces between the broad strokes of history illustrating the internal disagreements in the movement as well as external forces opposing it shirley and episodes beyond it depict moments where experienced political movers tell activists what is or isn t possible where the concerns of the marginalized are often the first discarded despite their efforts to bring the wider movement to where it is unfortunately lacks the room to delve as deeply into this as the breadth of the moment is often subject to the gravitational pull of schlafly s story again some of this is necessary and even addressed by the show the era organizers in discussing their infighting note that schlafly and her stop era team have one message and want one thing while the women s movement is concerned with a large platform of positions that are often argued over but the show is also more interested in schlafly with every episode a new chapter in her slow development from ambitious political hopeful to one of the disingenuous and shrewd voices that helped build the framework for our it

Now, Netflix is planting another flag in the ground with a new exclusive deal, making all future episodes of ,exclusive to its platform in the US.  ,The new deal means the first 12 episodes of ,, the 23rd season of the iconic anime franchise, will be available to stream on Netflix starting June 12th, 2020. Future episodes will be added to Netflix every quarter for the rest of the season, according to the company. The Pokémon Company International has struck other deals with broadcasters around the world, but in the US, , is about to become a streaming exclusive. ,“With their tremendous reach and ability for fans to enjoy content anytime and anywhere, Netflix is the ideal partner to premiere new episodes of the beloved animated , series in the US,” Emily Arons, senior vice president of international business at The Pokémon Company International,,.  ,Prior to Netflix’s deal, ,aired on networks like , in the United States.

Melissa Cobb, vice president of kids’ and family content for Netflix, ,in 2018 that “animation is really a core area,” with analyst firms estimating that Netflix spent just over $1.1 billion on animation content that year alone. More than 60 percent of Netflix users engage with kids’ and family content, Cobb , last year, and it’s an area Netflix clearly sees as a growing sector.,Netflix is the new destination spot for kids’ content. Disney is focusing on its streaming service, Disney Plus, bringing a number of new originals to that platform instead of solely focusing on its cable alternatives, Disney Channel and Disney XD. ViacomCBS has licensed a number of its titles, including parts of ,, to Netflix and Amazon. Kids are spending ,, and Netflix, one of the biggest distributors of online video, is trying to meet that audience demand. ,Perhaps the most exemplary case of how fast the shift in viewing from traditional cable to streaming has been, kids’ television has “lost nearly 70 percent of its audience since its peak in 2011, according to Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger,” ,.

Right now, that’s streaming — and even more so, it’s Netflix. ,The push for kids’ entertainment to transition to streaming is not all thanks to Netflix. YouTube is also a major player in the fight for kids’ and families’ attention. Yet Netflix is gearing up to invest billions of dollars in entertainment focused at a generation of TV watchers who don’t wait around for 11AM to hit so they can watch ,on cable. ,“We continue to believe there is nothing Viacom can do to compel kids and teenagers to put down their iPads and their TikTok and sit in front of a TV set to watch a show ‘when it comes on,’” Juenger wrote, as reported by ,.,Netflix is one of the few apps that people automatically turn to when looking for something to watch, and Netflix wants to stay in that spot, competing against some of its biggest competitors like Disney Plus. “Are we kicking up our kids and family content, and animation? You bet,” CEO Reed Hastings said on a recent earnings call. ,is just the latest addition to Netflix’s race to dominance in kids’ entertainment.

62,Netflix makes reality shows exclusively for the extremely online,2020-04-23,Joshua Rivera,"’s premise is hard to see as anything other than desperate. A collection of hot people are promised a hedonistic island getaway, then surprised with a big catch: a $100,000 prize, but only if they abstain from having sex. As a group of mostly accomplished sex-havers who meet each other in swimwear, this is the opposite of what they want, and the show doesn’t , expect them to not hook up; they’ll just lose some prize money every time they get too horny. Whether or not the show is good doesn’t really matter, because like all of Netflix’s 2020 reality shows, it was made to go viral — and quality doesn’t really matter for that. A successful Netflix reality show isn’t about being entertaining. It’s about being online. ,, Netflix’s first reality show of 2020, was also the most openly interested in figuring out how to bring digital life into an easily digestible reality competition. It did this by simply making social media the point, telling its contestants that they would only ever interact with each other through the show’s eponymous social network, The Circle. Because of this, they could be whoever they wanted to be. Some participants chose to stick to who they really were; others took a more ,-style approach by playing as someone else entirely.,It was a reality competition about the , — the internet in a nutshell, presented in a bingeable reality series. It’s also an easily exportable one. Currently, there’s a version of ,for the United Kingdom, Brazil, and France. These regional adaptations might as well underline the point: the internet can be a culture unto itself, a medium where personas are invented and rebuilt daily regardless of their physical circumstance. ,, Netflix’s second reality show this year, narrowed its lens to focus on dating. Like ,, it’s a potent fusion of the heightened personalities fostered by both reality television and life online. In it, contestants are divided by gender (,is cripplingly heteronormative) and kept apart, going on literal blind dates in pods where they can hear, but not see each other. It’s a mode of interaction more intimate than, say, Tinder, but still fraught with some of the same anxieties: in a world where anyone can present themselves in any way they choose, how do you know what’s genuine? ,As ,ups the stakes — to proceed in the “experiment” (as the show calls itself), couples must get engaged, sight unseen — the series takes a very online concern to Bravo-esque heights of surrealism. Couples with only a handful of conversations under their belt meet each others’ families, prepare for a wedding, and try to not second-guess their relationship now that they can hang out with other contestants. In juxtaposing participants’ initial isolation with the messiness of reality television, it takes on a common theme with ,: consistency as authenticity. ,The couples , gets the most mileage out of are the ones who dependably lean into their broad archetype; even if their personas do not appear genuine. While not a competition, there are heroes (the sincere and sweet Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed) and villains (the vain and superficial Matthew Barnett and Amber Pike). As other couples fall to the wayside, , becomes an endurance test to see if your chosen (or, given the genre we’re dealing with, assigned) persona holds, wringing drama from moments where masks look like they may slip. It’s telling that for Hamilton and Speed, the show never really ended — the two have leveraged their newfound fame ,.,That consistency brings us back to ,, the newest and shallowest show in Netflix’s growing reality TV empire. Unlike the other shows, which sort its characters ,style into various archetypes, ,’s cast mostly falls on a scale that goes from selfish to horny, or selfish and horny, and counts on that to be enough. The cynicism of the enterprise makes for a show that barely seems like it should even hold together. It’s hosted by a smart speaker named Lana that looks like ,, there’s a narrator who provides commentary that barely makes sense, and it’s all tied together with halfhearted moralizing messages about how contestants might learn there is more to love than sex. ,Yet it doesn’t really matter because, again: this is about being online, except that, unlike Netflix’s other reality shows, it’s not interested in people. It gives its contestants almost zero opportunities to slide from person to performance, everyone involved is only as interesting as their last Instagram (and whether they will succumb and have sex). It’s the internet as pure consumption and not creation. ,To those who lead an online life, it’s no secret that performance lies at the heart of it. This is why “catfish” is a verb and not just the title of a movie / TV show, why YouTubers and live-streamers foster ,, and why we’ve developed a nigh-innate ability to decipher what’s implied by the angle, background, and framing of a given Instagram post. We know that posting does not make a person, so we decide on a case-by-case basis if the posts are good enough to connect with on their own merit, or if we’d rather see a person on the other end of the screen. ,That Netflix’s reality programming would take on a uniquely online texture shouldn’t be terribly surprising. In terms of ubiquity and traffic, ,, accounting for an astonishing amount of time and bandwidth. Just as reality television emerged on cable and broadcast to present a , populated by , that gamified small-screen fame, it’s being reinvented on Netflix for our extremely online world. If Netflix’s reality shows seem a little more ridiculous than what came before, it’s because they are: the ante has been upped, and reality television is no longer about “normal” people competing against scripted dramas and comedies. ,Now, the whole internet is the network, and everyone with a smartphone is competition. Going viral could happen to you, so why would you watch someone else striving for small-scale fame? Unless, of course, they’re reckless enough to try something like, say, moving into a building full of potential catfish where their only communication was a fake social network. Or marry someone they’d never get to see until they proposed. Or completely ruin a small team of aspiring influencer’s chances at winning money because you cannot keep your hands off each other. That might work. It might be enough to get people to stop posting about their own lives for long enough to post about a few lives sponsored by Netflix.
