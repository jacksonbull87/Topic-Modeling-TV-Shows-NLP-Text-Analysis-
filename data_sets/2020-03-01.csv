32,Little Fires Everywhere wants you to know it’s definitely about race,2020-03-20,Joshua Rivera,"In ,, people are constantly talking about how they would never “make something about race.” They often say it with shocked indignation — they don’t ,, how could you , that? — because they think of themselves as good people, in the way only wealthy white folks can. You know the kind of people who describe themselves as “comfortable?” , is a show about that very specific demographic, and what happens when their carefully constructed world starts to tear at the seams. People are challenged with the notion that maybe they aren’t as progressive and open-minded as they think they are. ,Hulu’s adaptation of Celeste Ng’s excellent novel is set in Shaker Heights, a real-life suburb of Cleveland. Taking place in the ‘90s, the story follows the well-to-do Richardson family, outlining the events that would lead to their house being burned down by their youngest daughter, Izzy (Megan Stott) — the event that kicks off the show. The eight episodes (the first three are out now, the rest weekly) that follow illustrate how the Richardsons got here, starting with the arrival of Mia Warren (Kerry Washington) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood), two people who get hopelessly tangled in the Richardsons’ lives, inadvertently exposing their worst traits. ,Mia, an artist, leads an itinerant life and has arrived in Shaker Heights with the hopes of giving Pearl a stability they’ve never had together. She leases an apartment from the Richardsons, and over time, she and Pearl slowly become more integrated in their daily life. Pearl attends the same school as the four Richardson children, befriending middle son Moody (Gavin Lewis) and pining after his older brother Trip (Jordan Elsass). Meanwhile, misfit Izzy begins to strike up a relationship with Mia, as Mia and Elena Richardson, the family matriarch, become increasingly wary of the influence each has on the other’s children. ,From here, , slowly starts to simmer, putting each of its cast of privileged white characters in situations that gradually escalate until they are forced to finally ditch their preferred euphemisms. Each encounter exposes another way in which they believe themselves to be good and decent because they’ve built a world where their sense of selves are not challenged. Elena’s daughter Lexie thinks herself virtuous for dating a black classmate, Brian, although she swears it doesn’t enter the equation. Elena hires Mia as her housekeeper, willfully ignorant of the race and class dynamics at play by hiring someone who pays her rent. Bill Richardson (Joshua Jackson), Elena’s husband, admonishes her for not getting a background check before offering the apartment to Mia. Elena, repeatedly, compliments herself for what a , she’s doing by helping the Warrens. ,Over and over again, the Warrens collide against the polite racism of those who pride themselves as not racist, and those small collisions slowly build to something catastrophic, as a friend of the Richardsons adopts a Chinese baby whose mother suddenly resurfaces, demanding her child back. It’s a crisis that compels the people in it to directly say what they’ve spent their lives talking around, and the results are not pretty.,While , has its sights set squarely on being a withering takedown of petty suburban class dynamics, it’s also remarkably understanding of the people within it. While its heart lies with the Warrens, every major player is considerably complicated. Elena Richardson is perfectly played by Reese Witherspoon — every passive-aggressive action cheerily delivered, and every boundary violation couched in the language of good intentions. As deft as the characterization is, the series is also interested in the forces that produce it — how a woman’s ambitions are stifled by societal pressures, and how she ultimately can end up reinforcing the boundaries that initially penned her in. ,That depth extends in every direction — Mia, as played by Kerry Washington, is a quiet force of nature, slowly realizing that she has just enough leverage to upend the neatly ordered worlds of the people who don’t know how much power they indiscriminately wield. As her past becomes less of a mystery, viewers begin to understand why she would apply that pressure. Through Pearl, Mia’s heartbreak is felt when the fault lines that she sees are clearly exposed for the first time. Through each of the Richardson children, the costs of perpetuating the life their parents made for them begin to manifest in unexpected ways. ,This is what , most clearly conveys: there are no easy answers, but there are people who benefit from the questions that go unasked. And when things get hard, there will always be people who have the option to make good choices and those who do not. Most times, the world counts on these questions going unasked, under the guise of manners. It’s not , to remind white people that they might benefit from whiteness or that people of color are not afforded the same opportunities. How could you make this about race?

35,"There is hope for Westworld, but you’re going to have to stick it out",2020-03-16,Joshua Rivera,"built a reputation on being mysterious. This made the first season irresistible, the second incomprehensible, and the forthcoming third season... well, you might have some questions — including “Is it still confusing?” “Who is a robot again?” and “Wait, is that Marshawn Lynch?” These are excellent questions. Some of the answers are good; some of them less so. ,In its third season premiere, the show does very little to catch new viewers up to speed, so here are the broad strokes: Westworld, the show’s eponymous park, is one of several theme parks where astonishingly lifelike robots populate re-creations of various historical periods. For a very large price, the wealthy can come and roleplay the fantasy of their choice for a spell, tourists for whom morality is completely optional and hedonism is encouraged — because, after all, the robots (called “hosts” here) aren’t real people. ,Season 1 was about complicating that, as the hosts of Westworld developed consciousness and became aware of the atrocities their creators forced them to live through over and over again. Season 2 was about revolution, as the hosts began to fight back and tear down the park around them. Throughout both, there are running threads tied to the elite who run and attend the park. This mostly related to an internal power struggle within Delos (the corporation that owns Westworld and its sister parks) and teasing that the actual purpose of Westworld is not entertainment but data: a perfect psychological profile of all the elite guests who visit it, built using their unfettered behavior in the parks. ,Unfortunately, this summary (and any summary, really) leaves out , by necessity because , is perhaps the most over-plotted show on television, obsessed with nonlinear storytelling, symbology, constant references to literature and philosophy, and regular plot twists or status quo shifts. It would be nice if the third season was a clean break that let viewers ignore it completely because catching up is exhausting. To a certain extent, you can! But as things begin to unfold, you’re probably going to need to open a wiki. ,The show’s third season begins with Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), the Westworld host who began the robot revolution, out in the real world and eager to enact revenge on her creators. From the four episodes provided to critics in advance, this seems to be the glue holding the season together: what does Dolores’ revenge look like? Which other hosts are out in the real world now? Who are her targets and why? It’s easy enough stuff, and it’s compelling to watch, too. While the show is named after a theme park that made for a fun setting, , slowly began to flesh out what the real world looked like and exploring that world is the best part of these early episodes. ,A big reason for this is that our guide to this world isn’t Dolores but Caleb (Aaron Paul), a disillusioned construction worker and veteran. He’s forced to pick up gig work via an app best described as “Taskrabbit but for crimes” in order to pay for his mother’s hospital bills. Through Caleb, we see this gilded cyberpunk world through working-class eyes, and few eyes are as good at charismatically conveying constant internal suffering than Paul’s. ,Things get more unwieldy as the show sprawls outward from there, catching the viewers up on who survived the massacre at the conclusion of last season and what their status is. The show does this at a languid, perplexing pace, sometimes grabbing your attention with an alarming twist, and in others, it falls back on its cryptic ways. There is, however, a glimmer of hope: by the end of the fourth episode, these seemingly disparate threads come together. The show seems to have a sense of purpose it has not had since its pilot. ,Early in its run, ,invited a lot of comparisons to video games. It made sense on multiple levels: the show was about a park that adhered to a game-like narrative design, and  it cared about detailing the push and pull between the desires of players, designers, and the emergent behavior of the system itself. Pull the lens back more, the way , season 3 does, and the metaphor continues to work astonishingly well. The games built by the characters of , are, like many of the biggest video games, power fantasies. Crucially, they’re power fantasies that map onto the inequality of the world: where labor is not valued, laborers are barely treated as human, and the innovations of science and technology disproportionately benefit the wealthy. ,But as Dolores notes at one point, these are all the products of systems, and systems are more fragile than the people who made them think. It’s a turn that has taken on a strange prescience given the rapidly changing state of the world due to a pandemic, shocks to said systems have a way of exposing just how much inequity is wholly unnecessary, perpetuated simply because there are profits to be made in sustaining it. To refer back to ,’s favorite paraphrasing of Shakespeare: violent delights have violent ends.

episode season you probably know all about there have been blogs about it since blogs were invented this is the best show ever made the story about a thoroughly corrupt anti gang unit in the lapd and their ongoing attempts to stay ahead of the consequences of their actions that relentless focus on consequence makes one of the most breathtaking tv shows you can watch as stunning decisions made in

with the meeting of jimmy chris gere an insufferable writer and gretchen aya cash a publicist who prefers her life in flames together they make a barely functional astonishingly misanthropic pair that should be forbidden by law but through sharp clever writing and a willingness to break your damn heart manages to use the toxic couple at the heart of its story to make a surprisingly earnest exploration of love and relationships while the middle seasons stumble veering a little too far in the direction of unpleasantness the show lands on its feet to be one of the most memorable and

40,Tiger King is a show about how the internet eats us all,2020-04-01,Joshua Rivera," is one of the strongest contenders for most watchable TV show of the year, and it’s a problem. A documentary miniseries comprising seven quick episodes, each under an hour, you could watch the whole thing in a weekend; given the subject, you’ll probably finish even faster. ,The Netflix series follows a man both larger than life and smothered by it: Joe Exotic, the one-time owner of a successful-seeming private zoo with over 200 tigers and other big cats. He’s a man who ran for president of the United States, then governor of Oklahoma, and then sometime after, may have tried to hire someone to kill his nemesis, a woman dedicated to shutting his zoo down. It’s incredibly compelling, and terribly so: ,is almost wholly dedicated to spectacle, with little interest in any sense of truth. And the truth is about as gutting as , is sensational.,As the eponymous Tiger King, Joe Exotic is magnetic: a ball-capped, mulleted man who swaggers with a knee brace and a drawl, wearing some combination of fringe vests, chaps, and bedazzled shirts at all times. You’ve never seen anyone on television like him. Born Joe Schreibvogel, the man’s eccentricities are accompanied by a tragic backstory that ,will deliver piecemeal and in passing. For the first few episodes, we meet him more or less fully formed: a man who has built a small empire with his larger-than-life personality and his equally large cats — an empire that, somehow, crumbled and landed him in prison. ,Every minute of , yields some new surprise, an unbelievable turn or charismatic stranger with incredible stories to tell. The documentary plays fast and loose with these anecdotes, as Joe Exotic shows us how he married two men at once, went into business with a guy who snuck tiger cubs into Vegas casinos, or nearly got mauled by one of his own lions. With no warning, the show also veers into immensely dark territory, as its subjects recount manipulative and abusive relationships, a death by suicide, and Joe Exotic’s sustained hate campaign against Carole Baskin, an activist committed to ending big cat ownership in America whom Joe Exotic also believes killed her wealthy husband for money.,As , goes on, its greatest strength — the litany of unbelievable stories it has to share — becomes its most concerning weakness, as the filmmakers don’t really seem to be interested in telling a story about its subjects as they are in milking them dry. There’s little point to , beyond its sensational thrills and credulously presenting everyone it puts in front of a camera. The show does not, for example, present any context for how seriously you should take the allegation that Carole Baskin killed her husband — so now this allegation is fodder for viral tweets, , for the , , that happens to have real-world fallout: new leads in case of Baskin’s missing ex-husband are being ,. ,It’s likely that you will watch , and wonder if there’s more to the story, and you’d be right. A cursory search for facts will likely lead to , feature about the tangled histories of Schreibvogel and Baskin, reconstructing their early lives and detailing their rivalry. Laid out in print, the story is far more sobering than the occasional flashes of somber distress we get on the show. Both Schreibvogel and Baskin are reportedly victims of abuse, dogged by misfortune and embraced by strange circumstances. Truth is elusive in both of their lives; Schreibvogel appears to be a serial fabulist, and Baskin’s public persona has a singular focus, with few public associations beyond the cats she keeps on her preserve. In their orbits, lives are destroyed — the overwhelming number of them sacrifices dedicated to the myth of the Tiger King.,There’s a level of complicity to viral fame that’s hard to square with shows like ,. In the streaming era, interest is often the result of direct action. There’s very little passivity left in how we entertain ourselves. We choose what to watch, what to recommend, and who to listen to, so if something like , is a viral hit, it , organic, like something we’re all talking about because we’re genuinely interested in it. ,Because of this, , becomes content that generates , content on websites and social media, which, in turn, leads more people back to ,. This, then, eventually leads to the extremely online becoming amateur sleuths and flooding Florida tip lines about a decades-old murder case. Through this cycle, suffering becomes sport — something that can be said of a lot of true-crime media — but also a call to action. ,It can be seen in the way the , encourages listeners to adopt a vindictive view of the role of law enforcement or in the entire cottage industry spun out of ,’s first season, which birthed an entertainment empire around the guilt or innocence of Adnan Syed. It’s a phenomenon fueled by our need to seek resolution where there often is none to be found. In the absence of finality, we post into the infinite.

65,"New trailers: Pixar’s Soul, Black Widow, Beastie Boys Story, and more",2020-03-14,Jacob Kastrenakes,"If the world weren’t on lockdown, I’d suggest you all go out to see ,, which just came out last weekend. It’s the latest movie from Kelly Reichardt, and despite the hilariously simple title, it’s a really great film. It can be loosely described as a heist movie about stealing milk from a cow, but it’s also about friendship, capitalism, and delicious fried oily cakes.,One of the really neat things the movie does is spoil the ending right at the start of the film. (I won’t spoil what that ending is here, even though it’s technically not a spoiler since it happens five minutes in.) I can’t remember seeing another movie do anything exactly like this. TV shows, like ,, have often teased out climatic moments (which I never liked), but , telegraphs where it’s going in a way that actually amplifies the tension. You know a certain event is coming. The questions are when and how it’s going to happen.,Since you probably aren’t going to the theaters anytime soon, I’ll just point out that some other excellent films from Reichardt are available on popular streaming platforms. ,, a thriller about eco-terrorism, is ,, and ,, which is about a band of settlers lost in the desert, is , ,.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Pixar’s next film looks like it could be one of the studio’s best in a while. The movie has Jamie Foxx voicing a jazz player who suddenly dies and whose soul then attempts to make its way back to Earth to keep on living. It comes out on June 19th.,Somehow, Spike Jonze hasn’t made a feature since ,, but he’s finally back with this Beastie Boys documentary, which is heading to Apple TV Plus. Jonze is a longtime collaborator of the band’s, and this documentary seems like a fittingly sweet look at the trio’s rise and friendship. It comes to some theaters on April 2nd before hitting Apple TV Plus on April 24th.,I’m pretty sure at one point in this trailer, The Rock charges at and tackles an attacking leopard. It’s ridiculous, but that’s the point — , looks like a plenty fun Disney adventure film with big characters, big settings, and big stakes. It comes out on July 24th.,Here’s the final trailer for Marvel’s long-awaited Black Widow solo movie. This final trailer puts more of a spotlight on Florence Pugh’s character, and it, of course, includes plenty of action.

83,"McMillions review: finally, the burger-related true crime series we’ve been waiting for",2020-03-02,Joshua Rivera,"It’s a good idea to have a few questions in mind whenever you order a burger. Nothing too wild. Simple stuff, like: Does this burger have cheese? (It should.) Other toppings? (Knock yourself out.) How about fries on the side? (Anything worth doing is worth doing right.) And then the most important question: Is this burger involved in a massive, years-long fraud scheme? Because, as HBO’s , would like to remind us, if you got a McDonald’s burger in the ’90s in the hopes of winning the chain’s annual Monopoly game, there was a huge criminal conspiracy devoted to robbing you of your chance to strike it rich. ,The documentary miniseries — which has aired four of six episodes — brings viewers back to the heyday of McDonald’s most successful promotion, which encouraged customers nationwide to buy fast food in order to score more Monopoly-themed game pieces. Prizes for collecting these pieces ranged from inconsequential (free fries) to massive ($1 million). And for twelve years, the game was completely rigged by a slowly expanding group of criminals who figured out how to crack the system. , devotes its hour-long episodes into slowly unspooling how this crime unfolded over its decade-plus reign, starting from the FBI agents who first started to pursue a tip they nearly dismissed outright, to the associates of the suspects they identify as the case gains traction. It’s a great story in and of itself, one ,in the summer of 2018. For the first few minutes of , however, you wonder if it’s being oversold — there’s some truly cheesy re-enactments, and the show’s initial focus makes it feel terribly narrow, like there isn’t much to hold your attention for five more hours of this. ,But there is much more, and the reasons to keep watching start piling up fast. First, there’s Agent Doug Matthews, the most prominent source early on. A junior agent in the FBI at the time the investigation into the Monopoly fraud scheme began, Matthews is such a good TV character it’s hard to believe he is, in fact, a real person. Loquacious and vain, Matthews talks with a soft drawl and heavy bravado, happy to recount his early days helping to construct an elaborate and reckless sting to draw out the fraudsters. He’s almost , eager, to the point where it starts to feel strange to essentially start rooting for the feds at a point where it’s not clear what the ,crime is. Then the bigger picture starts to come into focus, and the cast of characters expands. , quickly becomes a whirlwind tour of an unlikely underworld, full of wannabe gangsters, Southern real estate impresarios, and friendly drug dealers who look like Jerry from ,. Like a lot of the most satisfying mysteries, the who of this story is apparent early on, and the hows and whys are what keeps you watching.,Mostly, it’s extremely satisfying to get lost in a true crime tale that doesn’t revolve around a grisly murder or the grifting of everyday people — the biggest victims here are almost always McDonald’s, and the people who get too greedy as the Monopoly fraud scheme grows. ,The biggest note of discomfort in , doesn’t necessarily relate to the fraud scheme at hand, but the idea of McDonald’s. Early on in the show, the corporation is described as being eager to cooperate with the FBI because of its brand image, a talking head noting that if McDonald’s cannot be trusted thanks to some fraudsters, it would cause irreparable damage to the brand. It’s an aside that kept coming to mind as footage lifted from news reports over the last decade or so played throughout the miniseries, video that showed all manner of everyday people flocking to their local franchise to eat. ,It’s striking how ordinary they are in comparison to the louder cast of characters that , follows. They’re an unassuming bunch of people, presumably doing what they need to do to get through an already-too-stressful day. They remind me of the times I ate McDonald’s as a kid, one of too many mouths to feed on not enough money, and then again as an adult, stretched thin and aware that it was sold to me by people paid too little, stretched as thin as I was, for the benefit of suits who, frankly, did not care.

85,"The Magicians is ending after season 5, but it’s raised the bar for fantasy shows",2020-03-04,Megan Farokhmanesh,"SyFy , weird, wild fantasy show , for a sixth season. Yesterday, the network announced that the current season will be its last. ,’ story will wrap up in the finale, slated for April 1st, and with it goes one of TV’s most underrated shows airing today.,At its outset, “what if Harry Potter, but with college orgies” was a fair shorthand explanation for exactly what the show was. Best friends Quentin Coldwater and Julia Wicker learn they have magical potential and are tested to enter a highly selective college. Quentin gets in; Julia gets booted. As their paths diverge in major ways, both begin to learn that magic has a cost, even when it’s dressed up with party tricks and cute co-eds.,It would have been easy for , to continue on as the wildly cliched story of one loner white guy, forever believing he’s special, learning that actually he is. And for a little bit, the show does. Much like the books the show is based on, Quentin is depressed, insufferable, and could probably use a shower. Lev Grossman’s trilogy is almost entirely preoccupied with Quentin’s experiences, Quentin’s point of view, Quentin’s fantastical journey. In contrast, the show’s writers have deftly adapted the best source material, while also crafting a diverse ensemble cast that takes focus off Quentin, ironically its weakest link. They’ve expanded its world in far more interesting, boundary-pushing ways. ,They allowed characters like Eliot and Margo, played by Hale Appleman and Summer Bishil, respectively, to evolve into the true beating heart of the show. That’s in large part due to the stellar acting of Appleman and Bishil, natural scene-stealers who make for an electric pair. But few characters like Eliot and Margo even , on TV. Eliot is an exceptionally charming disaster, haunted by his own vices, saved by his dedication to his friends and good heart. Margo, who could have easily been written off as the tired trope of a mean girl with anger issues, was given space and nuance to exist as a powerful woman fighting to endure in worlds that did not want her. Her path has been one of the show’s best as we’ve come to understand the layers of pain and anger that exist alongside her confidence, tenderness, and moments of royal fuck-ups. Together, the two are a perfect foil for each other, a pair whose platonic love for one another acts as a throughline for everything they do. That’s also to say nothing of their on-screen representation as a queer man and a woman of color.,Over the course of its run, , tackled topics like depression, sexual assault, death, drug addiction, burgeoning queer sexuality, and gender politics. Magic is not the focus of the show, but rather a complement to the lives of characters who still inhabit a very modern world. In season 5, a big emphasis has been placed on characters dealing with loss, PTSD, and learning how to find purpose again as they move into new stages of their lives. It’s delivered many of these poignant, rich storylines while also setting itself against backdrops that involve drug trips, time loops, and breaking the moon.,That was the beauty of ,: its world could still feel surprising and fun, even in the face of utter devastation. Its writers are clearly genre nerds who loved to pay homage to and play with storylines involving time travel, epic fetch quests, and bank heists, and the show is better for it. I never thought I’d earnestly try to convince any of my friends that its best moments include an impromptu musical number in which the cast has to sing Queen’s “Under Pressure,” a disco ball bomb that forces people to dance, or even that my favorite joke is a 10-second gag involving a talking rabbit that only says “eat my ass.”  ,That a show could do all of that and still have something to say about the human condition is what made it special. Not even magic can solve the pain of being alive. But for five years, , helped just a little.

86,Warren Ellis wrote Castlevania season 3 in a ‘rapture of mad power’,2020-03-06,Adi Robertson,"Netflix’s , is the rare video game adaptation that’s actually worth watching. Executive produced by Adi Shankar and written by prolific comics author Warren Ellis, it remixes the classic gothic series into a bloody anime-influenced adventure featuring some of the games’ biggest characters. Yesterday, Netflix released a third season that’s longer, weirder, and more ambitious than its predecessors.,I spoke to Ellis and , executive producer Kevin Kolde about how the show has evolved while still drawing inspiration from Konami’s games. I also got to ask about some of my favorite pieces of season 3. So while there aren’t major plot points revealed in the interview, it references specific characters and events — and anything ahead could be considered a spoiler.,In some senses, I think you’re probably not wrong. Due to the events of season 2, we now have a power vacuum in that region of the world — and also a degree of chaos. A lot of people are not very organized. And if you don’t have a plan, you become part of someone else’s plan, and it’s never comfortable for you. So in a sense, while I’m not sure I would go with the word “cruel,” I think possibly the situation is a lot scarier and less stable than maybe people would have expected after the end of season 2., Famously, I never played the games, so I have no real knowledge of the series except what’s on Wikipedia or a fan page. But as I had the opportunity to broaden the cast and introduce new characters, Saint Germain leapt out to me because I’ve always been fascinated by that period of itinerant magicians and astrologists touring the great courts of Europe and doing people’s charts for coins.,And the Infinite Corridor was just such a weird thing to find in the material. “Oh by the way, there’s a channel to alternate worlds in the games somewhere!” That was just so random that I couldn’t leave it alone.,I’ve got nothing I can play the games on! I’m sitting here in front of an old ThinkPad. I’ve never actually owned a games console apart from the Atari my granddad gave us for Christmas in like 1982 or something. So I wouldn’t even know how., There’s also a bunch of people on the team that have played the games and played them sort of voraciously. Our director Sam Deats and assistant director and brother Adam Deats are huge , game nerds, and you’ll find a lot of elements from the game that they bring in.,Dracula was the oldest and had been through many many life changes, and you have to work really hard , to develop a degree of self-reflection if you’re going to live that long and go through that many experiences. So some of his responses played as more human than the human characters.,In season 3, all of the characters are a lot younger, and they’re a lot more turned inward. Dracula was not necessarily about thirst as a vampire. Most of the other characters are all about their thirst. So that kind of gives them a sharper edge as antagonists. They are more human in that they’re a lot more focused on what they want, which, in a lot of ways, makes them more immediately dangerous., Well, as I enter close to my second half-century of life, I’m possibly flattering myself. But you know, I’ve read interviews with people who are a hundred years old, and they do have a level of self-awareness and self-reflection that I find fascinating. So I kind of moved that over into Dracula a bit.,The squad from Styria! No, I think I made them all up. It just made sense to me that she would have a crew. She would be co-ruling with other people because she’s been spending time away from Styria and she wouldn’t just leave that to anybody. So as soon as I landed on the idea that she would be ruling with other people, it was clear that it would be with other women. So then I started inventing all the other three characters.,It almost mirrors season 2 where Dracula fades into the background a little bit. He’s away with his plans and his misery and the other characters kind of come to the fore. So it’s kind of mirroring that and suggesting she’s entering a Dracula-like role. Also, I had the space! I could introduce new characters I found interesting see how they strike off each other., Oh, you caught that! Oh, god. Okay. Thank you., Not on my watch! Sorry, I didn’t say that. It’s terrible, because [voice actor] Theo James, he’s got that big resonant heroic voice that immediately makes me hate him. But also, he does this thing where he can let little cracks of insecurity and vulnerability into his voice, which fascinated me. The confluence of these two things meant that I had immense fun just torturing the poor guy., It’s interesting because some of this is cyclical. The situation in Wallachia, you could relate to relatively current events. But you know, 50 percent of the time, a dictator is removed from any region, there’s a power vacuum and a civil war. This is just how these things happen, sadly. So some of it could come from my reading of history, some could come from my responses to current events. I try not to interrogate it too closely when I’m doing it, not least because nobody needs an opportunity for me to get up on my soapbox and start waving my arms. I try to do less of that these days., I try to stay out of it, not least because you only have to have one bad day and then you’re that writer who shows up to tell everyone they’re watching it or reading it wrong. Once a year, I kind of wave to the kids on Tumblr and say thank you very much. Once the show’s done and streaming, it’s theirs to do whatever they want with., I have, by and large, retired from the internet. I just have to wake all the channels up in order to do the show launch. But yeah, I like to stay the hell away from it. People are going to say and do whatever they’re going to say and do, and they should be left alone by the writer., That’s largely a change in my relationship with it., Are we talking about the , and so on?,There are two ways in which I write the big action scenes in the show. Sometimes they’re scripted right down to the beat. And then sometimes, I’ll lead up to a scene, describe what the scene needs to be and how it’ll end and any dialog and beats I need, and then I’ll just say “Sam, I figure you’ve got about two minutes for this. Go nuts.” The tower scene is one of those scenes., The Legion character, the giant ball of bodies, was actually something Sam and Adam came back to us with once they had received the script and started working sort of a classic, scenario into the scene, and it just kind of made sense. They’re probably super happy with it, but they probably regretted it at the time because I think, technically, from an animation standpoint, it was a pretty monumental task., I think I got blamed for their misery, even though I just let them do it, and it was all their fault.,The general rapture of mad power of having 10 episodes. So sure, let’s have little philosophical conversations in the bowels of sailing ships! Let’s do a full psychedelic , Infinite Corridor! If I wanted to stop the show dead so Isaac could talk to a mad magician woman in the desert foothills of Italy, I could do it. I wanted to try to change the way the show was paced, to change the nature of some of the things we’ve talked about. They’d already ordered the season. What were they going to do? Fire me?,I killed any chance of season 4 right there. Sorry, everybody.",netflix s is the rare video game adaptation that s actually worth watching executive produced by adi shankar and written by prolific comics author warren ellis it remixes the classic gothic series into a bloody anime influenced adventure featuring some of the games biggest characters yesterday netflix released a third season that s longer weirder and more ambitious than its predecessors i spoke to ellis and executive producer kevin kolde about how the show has evolved while still drawing inspiration from konami s games i also got to ask about some of my favorite pieces of season so while there aren t major plot points revealed in the interview it references specific characters and events and anything ahead could be considered a spoiler in some senses i think you re probably not wrong due to the events of season we now have a power vacuum in that region of the world and also a degree of chaos a lot of people are not very organized and if you don t have a plan you become part of someone else s plan and it s never comfortable for you so in a sense while i m not sure i would go with the word cruel i think possibly the situation is a lot scarier and less stable than maybe people would have expected after the end of season famously i never played the games so i have no real knowledge of the series except what s on wikipedia or a fan page but as i had the opportunity to broaden the cast and introduce new characters saint germain leapt out to me because i ve always been fascinated by that period of itinerant magicians and astrologists touring the great courts of europe and doing people s charts for coins and the infinite corridor was just such a weird thing to find in the material oh by the way there s a channel to alternate worlds in the games somewhere that was just so random that i couldn t leave it alone i ve got nothing i can play the games on i m sitting here in front of an old thinkpad i ve never actually owned a games console apart from the atari my granddad gave us for christmas in like or something so i wouldn t even know how there s also a bunch of people on the team that have played the games and played them sort of voraciously our director sam deats and assistant director and brother adam deats are huge game nerds and you ll find a lot of elements from the game that they bring in dracula was the oldest and had been through many many life changes and you have to work really hard to develop a degree of self reflection if you re going to live that long and go through that many experiences so some of his responses played as more human than the human characters in season all of the characters are a lot younger and they re a lot more turned inward dracula was not necessarily about thirst as a vampire most of the other characters are all about their thirst so that kind of gives them a sharper edge as antagonists they are more human in that they re a lot more focused on what they want which in a lot of ways makes them more immediately dangerous well as i enter close to my second half century of life i m possibly flattering myself but you know i ve read interviews with people who are a hundred years old and they do have a level of self awareness and self reflection that i find fascinating so i kind of moved that over into dracula a bit the squad from styria no i think i made them all up it just made sense to me that she would have a crew she would be co ruling with other people because she s been spending time away from styria and she wouldn t just leave that to anybody so as soon as i landed on the idea that she would be ruling with other people it was clear that it would be with other women so then i started inventing all the other three characters it almost mirrors season where dracula fades into the background a little bit he s away with his plans and his misery and the other characters kind of come to the fore so it s kind of mirroring that and suggesting she s entering a dracula like role also i had the space i could introduce new characters i found interesting see how they strike off each other oh you caught that oh god okay thank you not on my watch sorry i didn t say that it s terrible because voice actor theo james he s got that big resonant heroic voice that immediately makes me hate him but also he does this thing where he can let little cracks of insecurity and vulnerability into his voice which fascinated me the confluence of these two things meant that i had immense fun just torturing the poor guy it s interesting because some of this is

87,Dispatches From Elsewhere wants you to play more weird games with strangers,2020-03-04,Joshua Rivera," doesn’t feel like a show so much as it does a wish. A man named Peter stumbles across an elaborate game, one that instructs him to go to unusual places and do outlandish things. Answer a pay phone and dance in public until Bigfoot appears. Attend a shareholder’s meeting for a company that doesn’t exist. Unveil a conspiracy or spearhead a revolution. Despite all the strangeness, the show is very clear about what it wants to do: help you to feel connected to other people. It wants to foster empathy. Maybe, in the end, it might pull it off. ,But first, the series puts you off-balance with 10 seconds of silence from Richard E. Grant, seated in an orange room, staring at the camera for that entire time. Grant plays Octavio Coleman, esq., a mysterious figure who narrates the show and seems to orchestrate the game that , chronicles, and as an actor capable of a frightening and disconcerting sincerity, it’s an effective way to begin. ,In his opening monologue, Coleman tells the viewer to imagine themselves as Peter, briefly summing up the circumstances of his life, which aren’t terribly important. What is important is that he is the protagonist, and a story is about to happen to him. Coleman is effectively telling us to watch a TV show, and it would all be too cute of a device to bear if , didn’t come from a place of overwhelming sincerity.,Jason Segel, who created and stars in ,, finally returns to TV after a decade in film, writing and appearing in movies like ,and ,. As Peter, he is disaffected and disillusioned to the point where he can’t really register how unhappy he is. Then he finds a series of strange flyers, offering to teach him things like dolphin telepathy, and they function as his gateway to the Jejune Institute, Coleman’s secretive organization dedicated to the unlocking of humanity’s strangest potential (hence the dolphin telepathy). ,Upon discovering Jejune, Peter also learns that there is another secret faction, the Elsewhere Society, that believes Jejune to be evil and is dedicated to freeing Clara — an unseen woman who is directly responsible for Jejune’s innovations. Longing for some kind of meaning in his life, Peter throws himself into the Elsewhere Society’s elaborate scheme, meeting other people who, like him, have stumbled upon this strange live-action role-play shadow war, scouring the city of Philadelphia for arcane and wonderful clues that will hopefully lead to Clara. ,is eager to surprise viewers, eager to dive into the surreal and whimsical at a moment’s notice, but not particularly interested in stumping you. It’s the anti-,, a story where mystery is certainly part of the equation, but not the point. None of the characters seem to truly believe that Jejune and Elsewhere are ,, just that this game has pulled them into a world more wonderful than their own, and they’d love to live in it a little while longer. ,Instead, , wants you to sink into the lives of those who find themselves enthralled by this game. Each of the first four episodes is named after a different member of the cast, most begin with Octavio admonishing the audience to imagine themselves as one of them: first Peter; then Simone (Eve Lindley), a trans woman in love with the theater of the game but not necessarily her life; then Janice (Sally Field), an older woman wondering what comes next after you’ve passed all the milestones people prepare you for your entire life; and finally Wynnfred (Andre Benjamin), a man who understands systems more than people and desperately wants to solve the game before anyone else. ,There isn’t a thing that , does that isn’t clearly signaled from the start. The show wears its heart on its sleeve, and there’s danger in that — earnestness can be cloying, and sincerity without clarity is a one-way ticket to corniness. It helps that , is framed around an elaborate larp game — games ask you to suspend your disbelief and social conventions to submit to rules and do strange things. In giving yourself over to a game, you join other people who have made the same concessions you have, and for a little while, you have something in common. The real hope of finishing a game isn’t winning, but that everyone you played with will continue to have things in common. , is a work fully given over to this desire, one that feels particularly potent at a moment when tabletop games seem to be at a previously unseen cultural peak.

91,Devs spins a Silicon Valley murder mystery into something unsettling and strange,2020-03-09,Joshua Rivera," is not a show that’s out to confuse you. The miniseries — which is billed as an FX show but airs exclusively on , — bears a lot of the hallmarks of extremely cerebral, puzzle-box television. There is strange imagery: a massive, towering statue of a young girl delighted at the forests around her. Redwoods surrounded by LED halos. Rooms full of pulsing, warm orange lights, as if they were alive. Characters who talk around things and are forthright about little. But as heavy as the atmosphere is, the show isn’t out to lose you. Instead, it wants you on its side. It’s dispassionate but angry. Maybe you should be, too. ,Despite its preference for aesthetics over clarity, the plot of , is a simple one: Lily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno) is a computer engineer who works for Amaya, a tech company that works, vaguely, in “quantum computing.” She, like most Amaya employees, works in the public-facing side of the company, which seems successful and highly regarded, even if it’s unclear what it actually does. The real action at Amaya is in Devs, a top-secret division of the company in a building few have even seen. ,The show begins when Lily’s boyfriend, Sergei, is selected to join Devs. When Sergei is suspected of trying to steal company secrets, he is killed. Amaya says it’s suicide, and Lily suspects foul play. , is about the cat-and-mouse game that follows, as Lily tries to pin down what Fores (Nick Offerman), Amaya’s mysterious CEO, is actually up to. ,This throughline gives , a nice momentum, making it the kind of understated sci-fi thriller that creator Alex Garland has become known for. Of course, there’s more going on — what the Devs unit actually , is a big part of the story — but answers come early, and , spends most of its time contemplating what the answers it gives you might mean. ,As a result of all this, , clearly favors plot over character, making it an easy show to bounce off of if you aren’t willing to buy in completely. That’s perhaps the biggest hurdle to clear. , is a show you need to be all-in on. It’s worth it, mostly. It’s made to contemplate the new world order where the government is held in sway by tech companies that are allowed to operate inscrutably and without oversight, using their immense power to pursue whatever they want. It’s sharply critical but not openly.

This is fitting. Much like the real-life tech companies it critiques, the show is about building a reality alongside but apart from the world most people live in, one that it shuttles people in and out of on private chartered buses where rules don’t matter and everyone is encouraged to think of themselves as god-king of a digital universe. For the few scenes set in San Francisco proper, the “real world” appears alien and wrong. ,This is the lure of Silicon Valley: like Rapture, the objectivist paradise of the , video games, it’s a place sheltered from consequence by wealth and power where the privileged wield their newfound power without restraint. , is most effective when it makes the scope of that power clear, in scenes where developers admire their handiwork, sequestered deep within their own private utopia.

93,The best movies and TV shows to stream when you’re working remotely,2020-03-13,Verge Staff,"In the era of social distancing that many of us now live in as part of a worldwide effort to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic, tons of people are now stuck at home for days or even weeks, discouraged from meeting in public places or hanging out in large groups. ,That means that it’s the perfect time to kick back, relax, and catch up on all of those great TV shows and movies you’ve been meaning to catch up on. But if you need some suggestions (or have already managed to burn through your backlog), we’ve put together our best recommendations for films you can watch to distract yourself instead of staying glued to Twitter watching terrible news stream in. ,Look, sometimes my brain isn’t dumb. It knows when I’m trying to distract it from a primal fear with shiny, happy things. But what about something , scary? That’s the appeal of horror anthology series ,, which favors a character-driven small-scale surrealism that’s completely unlike our grim planet-wide pandemic. The series starts reasonably well in season 1 (the reality-breaking TV show season), hits its stride in season 2 (the reality-breaking haunted house season), gets pulpy in season 3 (the reality-breaking cannibal family season), and wraps up in season 4 (the reality-breaking manifestation of childhood fantasies season). Just don’t look up the , , , ,, unless you’ve got enough time for an hours-long creepypasta binge, too. , ,Doctors are facing huge challenges as they try to understand and fight COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. But they can be glad they’re not Dr. Rick Dagless, MD, star of a ludicrously awful TV series from (fictional) horror author Garth Marenghi. , is ostensibly a rerelease of this series-within-a-series, framed by commentary from Marenghi and his co-star Dean Learner (actually ,Matthew Holness and Richard Ayoade). It’s also a hilarious metafictional spoof of ‘80s horror and a portrait of a small, deluded, narcissistic man who’s convinced he’s a genius. Now, is explicitly laying out some shallow thematic tie with the novel coronavirus sort of contrived here? Yes. But I know writers who use subtext, ,. , Unofficially, , is ostensibly a show about death — and one mad piemaker named Ned (played by the impossibly charming Lee Pace) who can reverse it with a touch. While the premise may sound morbid, , is a delightful, earnest, and wildly optimistic show about love, life, and using your magical powers to reverse death to right wrongs and solve crimes. It’s the perfect pick-me-up for anyone who is feeling down. ,: , (CW’s weird free streaming site),This is where I’m supposed to write a blurb about why , (2019) is a good and reassuring thing to watch. , (2019) is not a good or reassuring thing to watch. It is a nightmare, filled with writhing shapes and monstrous fur-and-flesh abominations that should never have been conceived, let alone rendered into horrifyingly realistic forms that cost hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of CGI.,What I’m saying is, if you are feeling bummed out about the pandemic, , (2019) will help alleviate those concerns by giving you something far worse to think about. , It’ll be available digitally on March 17th on online stores like ,, ,, and , is my go-to show when I just need something chill to watch. The show is about a group of high school girls in rural Japan who enjoy camping, and that’s basically it. There aren’t any real conflicts or drama; you just watch them go to these amazing actual campsites around Mt. Fuji. It also teaches you a lot about how to actually camp, and it makes the idea of camping in cold weather seem appealing. , ,When you’re in need of something to watch, you can always find a Rob Lowe classic to keep you from going bonkers while you’re under quarantine. If you need something to soothe your political anxiety, watch Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn in ,. If you just need pure happiness, watch him as the eternally optimistic Chris Traeger in ,. Need some non-coronavirus melodrama? Watch him opposite Calista Flockhart as the dreamy Robert McCallister in ,. The possibilities are endless; there are OG ‘80s movies like , and ,and there’s,even a Rob Lowe show on network TV right now called , , Depends on your Rob Lowe movie or TV show of choice,For the past week, I’ve been curling up with a glass of wine (and sometimes Chinese takeout) and hanging with some new friends of mine: Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda. Yes, I’m a little late to the game, but honestly, this is the perfect time to watch a show portraying a warm NYC in the late ‘90s. Central Park in bloom, not a subway to be seen — or even mentioned — the women attend great clubs and fancy meals: all things that are far from the current state of NYC (let alone my experience of NYC for the six years I’ve lived here). And if that wasn’t dreamy enough, there are landline phones! They weren’t constantly getting news updates on a 1998 ,, the dream. , ,The days of extreme vampire hype are over, but this has long remained one of my guilty pleasures. The acting is cheesy, the style is very dated (the show’s first episode aired in 2009), and the fashion is a not-so-welcome blast from the past, but all of this only adds to the charm. With a whopping 171 episodes over eight seasons, this show is certainly a time commitment and very suited for working from home. It doesn’t matter how many times I’ve seen it, the storyline sucks me in every time. Elena Gilbert is a character I love to hate, but she really encapsulates what it’s like to grow up in the face of tragedy (after tragedy, after tragedy, after tragedy). , is truly a story of grief, friendship, love, and monsters. , ,Sometimes, you just need more cat content. Well, the truth is, you , need more cat content. , is one of my favorite films to watch. It’s about seven street cats who live in Istanbul and wander freely around the city, making connections with the people and communities around them. Meet Duman, or “The Gentleman,” who made friends with the owners of a fancy deli. Then there’s Aslan Parcasi, or “The Hunter,” who lives at a famous fish restaurant. Every cat has a different personality, and it’s lovely to watch. But even better is seeing the compassion people have for them. I highly recommend watching this with a package of Oreos and a kitty by your side. , ,, ,, ,Pandemics are scary. Murder is, arguably, less scary — especially when murder comes in the form of witches, haunted carnivals, ‘80s camp slashers, and an actual murder house. ,used to stream on Netflix, but then FX’s deal with Netflix seemed to come to an end, and it disappeared. Now, thanks to FX’s new “FX on Hulu” hub, every season is available to watch. If a good portion of us are going to be working from home for the foreseeable future, we need shows that we can binge throughout the day. ,is campy and perfect. Plus, Evan Peters... need I say more? I’d recommend starting with Murder House (the first season) and then jumping around the seasons to meet your fancies. My personal favorite is still ,’s second season, but the third season has Stevie Nicks. Again, I ask: need I say more? , , ,I grew up watching procedurals on sick days. Bad cold? ,. Flu got you down? ,. Have to stay home for an uncertain but lengthy amount of time? ,. The nice thing about procedurals is they don’t take much brainpower. You can probably guess who did it about 20 minutes into the episode! And since they all tend to blend together at some point, it’s the perfect background show to have on throughout the day when you’re working from home and pretending to pay attention in video meetings. There are a number of ,series to choose from, but ,is my favorite. —Julia, ,Whether people want to accept it, ,is the pinnacle of American pop culture. This is a family that went from being B-list celebrities, thanks to their father who helped another lawyer in OJ Simpson’s trial, to arguably the face of new American celebrity in the mid-aughts. Early seasons of ,are a bizarre time capsule. Like procedurals, reality TV requires no thinking, and it’s impossible not to get caught up in. If you ever thought, “I should see what the hype is all about,” now’s the time. ,is ridiculously addicting, and, at the heart of it, the show is a story about sisterhood that really comes through as they become the influencers we know them as today. ,A quick little fact about me: I love teen dramas. Anything that’s clearly inspired by John Hughes movies immediately has me invested. Teen dramas are hit or miss. They start off great but go off the rails (,), they’re classic WB or CW shows (,), or they just miss the mark (,). Lately, Netflix has ushered in a new era of great teen storytelling. There’s the Spanish show about wealthy teens hooking up and killing each other (,, which I would also recommend if you need a new show), post-apocalyptic comedies (,, also worth your time), or bizarre series based on a warped sense of dark humor I devour every time (,, easily another top recommendation). ,is my favorite show in recent memory. The soundtrack slaps, the cast is charming, the storyline is sensational, and, perhaps best of all, it takes three hours to watch it in its entirety. The show is about an angsty teen with superpowers that all ties back to a possible government cover-up that her late father was involved in, and it’s better than it has any right to be. Seriously, make time for this one — it’s so worth it. ,Sometimes, you just need to tune out all of the chaos in the world and watch an animated Disney movie. When people think of animated Disney films, they most likely think of classics like ,, ,, and ,. But there’s one animated Disney film that was released in the mid-’90s that I feel is the most underrated film of that decade: ,. ,It’s a heartwarming story that focuses on the importance of family, unconditional love, and seizing your moment. Also, did I mention how amazing its soundtrack is? ,You may not be able to live your normal life, but that doesn’t mean you can’t live vicariously through others. , is just about the most laid-back reality show there is. It’s about six young Japanese people who are put together in a house, and they mostly just live their life. There are no challenges, and no one forms alliances. Yes, there’s romance and the occasional drama, but there’s also genuine friendship and people trying to help each other out. In one early episode, the house has a meeting because they’re worried that a budding baseball player is slacking off too much. The biggest , drama to date involves someone eating a steak that wasn’t theirs. Mostly, though, you’re watching awkward first dates and young people struggling to find their true passion. When someone feels their time on the show has come to an end, they simply leave, and another 20-something takes their place. The show is slow-paced yet strangely engrossing, and it’s anchored by a group of hilarious hosts who dissect each episode at various points. The best part: if you haven’t watched it yet, there’s a lot to dig into, with four seasons set everywhere from Tokyo to Hawaii. , ,There’s something extremely comforting to me about a British mystery series. The best ones feature a quirky detective / police officer / lawyer in an interesting, often scenic setting solving mysteries by interrogating lots of suspicious people with interesting accents. Even those series that try to be more gritty are usually reassuring, as the protagonist does their best to act ethically while bringing justice to the world. My personal favorites are ,, which features a middle-aged, grumpy, brilliant police detective in rural northeast England, and ,, in which a smart, pushy private detective solves mysteries in 1920s Australia (okay, Australia’s not Britain, but what the hell) while dressing fabulously and inviting good-looking witnesses into her bed. One hint: if you want to understand what everyone is saying, keep the closed captions on. , ,“Take car. Go to mum’s. Kill Phil, grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over. How’s that for a slice of fried gold?”,(Note: probably don’t go to The Winchester, given that large public gatherings at places like bars may not be the best idea right now.) , ",in the era of social

95,"New trailers: Artemis Fowl, Connected, Antebellum, and more",2020-03-07,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I spent last week watching through the new ,, Hulu’s adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel (and, more importantly, an update to the much-loved John Cusack film). The show was largely shot around where I live, so it was kind of just cool looking out for places I know. Shout out to my local pizza shop for the brief cameo.,Something that I kept thinking about while watching the new series is how much has changed since the movie came out. Where knowing endless music trivia was once the realm of passionate nerds, it’s now weirdly commonplace thanks to the internet. You can’t really write a cool conversation about some niche genre because chances are a wide swath of people already know everything about it. That makes the whole conceit a little harder to pull off.,It’s also possible that there’s just a specific audience for this story, and that’s an audience of people coming up alongside the artists being referenced and still learning everything about music themselves. Looking back at some clips of the 2000 film, nearly all of the musical references I caught were fairly mainstream — stuff I easily recognize now, but would have been clueless to as a teenager. I still love the vibe of ,, I just don’t know that it can be recreated once you’ve already been there.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,After an extended delay (the first trailer for this movie came out in 2018), Disney is finally putting out its adaptation of the 2000s book series ,. This trailer flashes through tons of shiny-looking sequences that suggest there’ll be plenty to gawk at, even if some core elements of the story look a little goofy (apparently a lot has been changed from the books, and ,). The film comes out May 29th.,I was so ready to hate this, but , looks extremely cute and the animation is wonderful. The movie is produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and comes out September 18th.,There’s another cryptic trailer out for the Janelle Monáe sci-fi movie ,, which seems to have Monáe playing a character who slips back and forth between being a modern-day activist and an enslaved woman in pre-Civil War America. It comes out April 24th.,is about a girl from Pennsylvania who has to travel to New York to get an abortion because she’s unable to get one at home without parental consent. The Sharon Van Etten song that scores the trailer certainly helps you feel something fast, but I think this movie would look like a super emotional coming of age story even without it. The film comes out March 13th.,A new documentary is coming up about jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald, featuring interviews with Smokey Robinson, Norma Miller, and Fitzgerald’s son, among others. It comes to theaters starting April 3rd.,This starts out looking like a tired rom-com, but it quickly turns into something a lot more interesting: a story about two teenage girls becoming friends in spite of the guy who comes between them. It comes out March 27th.,Mark Ruffalo stars in HBO’s adaptation of the Wally Lamb novel,. I hadn’t heard of the book before now, and all I can say is that it sounds exceptionally dramatic and seems to have way too much going on. The limited-series adaptation starts April 27th.,Warner Bros. has a new take on Scooby-Doo on the way that looks pretty... fine. It’s a kids movie through and through, but I’ll give it that the Netflix jokes in the middle are pretty good. The movie comes out May 14th.,Taika Waititi has a small but ridiculous role in this wonderfully ludicrous-looking comedy about a cult obsessed with a very specific bathtub. It comes to some theaters on March 6th and starts streaming later in the month.",i spent last week watching through the new hulu s adaptation of the nick hornby novel and more importantly an update to the much loved john cusack film the show was largely shot around where i live so it was kind of just cool looking out for places i know shout out to my local pizza shop for the brief cameo something that i kept thinking about while watching the new series is how much has changed since the movie came out where knowing endless music trivia was once the realm of passionate nerds it s now weirdly commonplace thanks to the internet you can t really write a cool conversation about some niche genre because chances are a wide swath of people already know everything about it that makes the whole conceit a little harder to pull off it s also possible that there s just a specific audience for this story and that s an audience of people coming up alongside the artists being referenced and still learning everything about music themselves looking back at some clips of the film nearly all of the musical references i caught were fairly mainstream stuff i easily recognize now but would have been clueless to as a teenager i still love the vibe of i just don t know that it can be recreated once you ve already been there check out nine trailers from this week below after an extended delay the first trailer for this movie came out in disney is finally putting out its adaptation of the s book series this trailer flashes through tons of shiny looking sequences that suggest there ll be plenty to gawk at even if some core elements of the story look a little goofy apparently a lot has been changed from the books and the film comes out may th i was so ready to hate this but looks extremely cute and the animation is wonderful the movie is produced by phil lord and christopher miller and comes out september th there s another cryptic trailer out for the janelle mon e sci fi movie which seems to have mon e playing a character who slips back and forth between being a modern day activist and an enslaved woman in pre civil war america it comes out april th is about a girl from pennsylvania who has to travel to new york to get an abortion because she s unable to get one at home without parental consent the sharon van etten song that scores the trailer certainly helps you feel something fast but i think this movie would look like a super emotional coming of age story even without it the film comes out march th a new documentary is coming up about jazz legend ella fitzgerald featuring interviews with smokey robinson norma miller and fitzgerald s son among others it comes to theaters starting april rd this starts out looking like a tired rom com but it quickly turns into something a lot more interesting a story about two teenage girls becoming friends in spite of the guy who comes between them it comes out march th mark ruffalo stars in hbo s adaptation of the wally lamb novel i hadn t heard of the book before now and all i can say is that it sounds exceptionally dramatic and seems to have way too much going on the limited series adaptation starts april th warner bros has a new take on scooby doo on the way that looks pretty fine it s a kids movie through and through but i ll give it that the netflix jokes in the middle are pretty good the movie comes out may th taika waititi has a small but ridiculous role in this wonderfully ludicrous looking comedy about a cult obsessed with a very specific bathtub it comes to some theaters on march th and starts streaming later in the month ,last new hornby importantly much cusack show around shout pizza shop something new series much since trivia realm commonplace swath people already everything make whole also people referenced still everything back would clueless still vibe recreated already nine first series shiny gawk even may phil lord miller another seems back enslaved pennsylvania new get abortion get one without parental consent sharon van etten something would like even without new ella fitzgerald smokey robinson norma miller fitzgerald among others like something two becoming spite ruffalo wally lamb seems much series new take scooby doo give may bathtub,2020-03-01,337,hornby importantly cusack shout pizza shop trivia realm commonplace swath referenced clueless vibe recreated nine shiny gawk phil lord miller enslaved pennsylvania abortion parental consent sharon van etten ella fitzgerald smokey robinson norma miller fitzgerald among becoming spite ruffalo wally lamb scooby doo
96,Ashly Burch saves video games by making fun of them,2020-03-13,Joshua Rivera,"isn’t just ,, but , connecting an older, weirder era of its culture to the more mainstream world of workplace comedies. Few people on the show exemplify this more than Ashly Burch, a writer on , who also plays Rachel, a wide-eyed game tester for the studio that makes the show’s eponymous game. ,Anyone watching , with more than a passing interest in games will recognize Burch’s name immediately — she’s spent the last decade as one of the industry’s most prominent voice actors, starring as Aloy in , and Chloe Price in ,. Older heads know her from ,, the long-running (and still funny) web series she made with her brother, writer Anthony Burch. As a writer for , — where she’s currently in the writer’s room for the second season — Burch is one of the show’s most experienced voices when it comes to the world of video games. ,This puts her in a uniquely insightful position when it comes to the ways the show skewers the games industry’s problems with diversity, sexism, and how quickly video game players will take anything you give them and use it to make a penis. ,: It feels kind of surreal to me because I’m a lifelong gamer and I always wanted to be a voice actor and I never, ever would have guessed that there would be a sitcom on a major streaming service about a game company. The business has been seen as so niche for so long. So it’s something that really legitimizes the games industry — not that it really needed that, it’s a multibillion-dollar industry — but it’s still been seen as niche for a long time. We were the kids playing ,and ,and no one knew what the hell we were talking about, and now there’s this show on Apple with an Oscar winner about a games studio!,I just found it exciting to have an outlet to talk about the industry. Because we have those conversations within the industry itself, with devs or with other voice actors. But it’s really cool and sort of fascinating to be something of an ambassador for the industry within the context of the writer’s room, and then also getting sort of the feedback and perspectives of some of the writers who maybe weren’t as familiar. ,I started doing web series with my brother over a decade ago, and that’s kind of how I first started getting into video games [for work], through video game sketch comedy. After that I did voice acting, and then I’ve given talks at different conventions and stuff about the industry, or the culture — so I’ve thought a lot about the industry from different angles for a long time. So it was just interesting and a lot of fun to funnel that knowledge into the context of the show. And to depict games in all of its flaws and all of its grandeur. To show the ugly side but also the beautiful side of games.,Because both exist. It’s a massive industry and it’s an amalgamation of a lot of different types of people, so you’re going to get people that are very toxic and very destructive, and then you’re going to get people that are lovely and love games and put good into the world through that love. I feel like we were able to give a complete picture of the industry, which I’m very grateful for and excited by. ,What I mostly find, honestly, is that people mostly don’t know a ton about the industry. I’ve been a voice actor for a long time, and over that time period, you know, you go to parties, people ask you what you do, I’ll say I’m a voice actor for games, mostly, and their response has more or less remained consistent, which is just confusion. Because, you know, like, Mario! “,They don’t realize that there are so many games with these sweeping epic stories that are just as compelling as any movie or TV show that you’ve seen. So mostly I think it’s been a lack of understanding, which isn’t malicious. It’s just, if you don’t play games, you don’t know! So what I think is awesome about , is that we’re getting the opportunity to present a holistic narrative of the industry and showcase that games are more than just Mario or more than just ,. And that they have a life or community all their own. To me that’s exciting. ,I think it’s probably changing, but I also think that a lot of people just know the broad highlights, they know about games their kids play, or they know about,. And so I think having a show like this just demonstrates a side to this world that people don’t often get to see, and you get to show that these folks are not tremendously that different. It’s not substantially different from a normal workplace, it’s got the same sort of problems. ,There’s a normalization that happens there, which is cool — and then getting to showcase the ways that it , different. Like, in the show when we talk about TTP*, that’s a real thing! [laughs] It’s a real thing that someone from Ubisoft told us about, and that is a complication that is , to games! You know, I don’t think accountants are having to worry about TTP. [laughs],*,Mythic Quest, ,I actually had not heard about it before the show! I hadn’t heard about it until Jason Altman, who works for Ubisoft, he was in the room a lot, and he told us about TTP. I think I, you know, assumed that I have enough of a knowledge of the gamer base to know that yes, they’re going to find a way to teabag someone, they’re going to find a way to make a penis — these things are known. But I did not realize there was an acronym that people used in gaming [laughs].,[Laughs] But sometimes in a good way! Sometimes in a great way. ,I think it would’ve been a huge omission to not talk about that on the show. It has been a problem, it continues to be a problem. We’ve gotten better, I think, but we still have a long way to go. I spoke to a friend recently who is a female programmer, and she said she literally had what happened to Michelle in that episode happen to her, which is that her company brought in a Girls Who Code group as a PR move to talk to her, and she didn’t sugarcoat it. She said, “This is a difficult place to work, and I feel undervalued.” She just kinda went , and it came out!,I am so glad and excited and grateful that Rob McElhenney and Megan Ganz and David Hornsby — that was their M.O. from the beginning: let’s showcase this world, let’s show all of it. You know? The good, the bad. And obviously we don’t want to make the whole show about Gamergate because the whole industry isn’t about Gamergate, but to not have acknowledged this disparity and the problems that women face in games, it would have been a huge omission. ,And I feel like we were able to tackle it in a way that was still funny and thought-provoking. I’m horrified that my friend went through this, but it was affirming that it resonated so much. That she saw that scene and was like, “That was me,” you know? Because it means we’re touching on things really true. ,I think I’ve seen a shift. Obviously the big event was Gamergate, and even though it was such a nightmare, and so harrowing for so many women and people of color during that time, the one silver lining I think was that the majority of developers came down on the side of “this sort of toxicity is unacceptable.” And rather than seeing a bunch of companies kowtowing to the whims of this very vocal minority, you saw, I think, an influx of characters that represented a larger player base. You saw female leads in major franchises and options for people of color in multiplayer games. I think you just saw a shift, and I think there’s no question after that — this is an environment that has a lot of toxicity in it, but also an acknowledgment that we don’t want that to be who we are. ,So the fallout from that — people were made aware how deep the problem went, and a shift happened after that. It’s the beginning of a good idea. We need to keep moving in that direction. ,Representation in games has improved over the years, I think that’s indisputable. I remember playing ,when I was younger, and the representation of women in that game is awful! Now you have Ellie in , or Aloy in ,. It’s different now. But I think the thing we need to keep pushing for is representation on the other side, in game dev. More game devs of color, LGBTQ game devs, female game devs. And continuing to push forward and make space for more diverse voices. ,But I do think that when the industry was confronted with that choice — do you want to continue on the path you always have, or are we going to address this toxicity? — this problem that has been bubbling under the surface of our industry, I do think that they chose the latter, for the most part. Obviously, things are not fixed fully. But what you see is an increase in those types of conversations. There are several prominent companies that have had sexual harassment issues that are being worked through now, and not all the solutions are perfect. But, at least in my view, we are making progress. That doesn’t mean we should rest on our laurels, but at least there seems to be a trajectory in the right direction. ,Oh yeah! They’re still , fun. I haven’t ever been a type of person who is like, “Because I’m writing on a comedy, I can’t watch comedy.” I don’t really have that experience. What’s so cool to me about games is how they still surprise me. I played ,over the holiday break, and that game blew my mind! It was so well-designed... I loved it. And I never would have imagined a game like that would exist — I mean, the short pitch is that you’re an insurance adjuster in the 1800s trying to figure out what happened to a ship! [laughs] Not the most exciting log line, but it’s such a compelling game. So to me it’s really cool to have been in the industry for this long, and to see where games started when I was a kid and before that, and now where we are. ,I do sometimes think that because we perpetually feel like the underdog, that there’s the feeling that , — that dampens people’s desires to take risks. I do wonder what our industry would look like if we just sort of felt like we had arrived, and we didn’t have to keep vying for cultural acceptance or cultural relevance. I feel like we would get to see different games. And I’m excited for that, I want that day to come.
