HBO Max will use anime from Crunchyroll to compete with Netflix’s growing empire,"

Some titles, like ,, also stream on Netflix. While HBO Max won’t be the exclusive home — shows will run on both HBO Max and Crunchyroll at the same time — subscribers will have more access to popular anime.,Although these are just a smattering of titles compared to the 1,000-plus series on Crunchyroll, the hope is to “introduce anime to a wider audience who appreciates compelling stories told through this dynamic medium,” according to Crunchyroll’s general manager, Joanne Waage. ,It’s a win-win for the two streaming platforms, both owned by AT&T. If mainstream audiences subscribing to HBO Max develop an affinity for anime being provided through Crunchyroll, they could potentially sign up for the anime streaming service in addition to HBO. (Crunchyroll currently has more than 2 million paid subscribers.) HBO Max can also tout an impressive anime offering at launch, with a consistent funnel for future content. WarnerMedia will also use HBO Max as the exclusive home for Studio Ghibli’s films in the United States, as Netflix secured the international rights to the popular and critically acclaimed films. ,Both Netflix and Amazon have spent millions of dollars investing in developing new original anime series and licensing top titles. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings expressed , that anime was a core area Netflix wanted to invest in.

How to be a Rick and Morty fan,"
          May  7, 2020,  9:58am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"After a mid-season hiatus, ,returned on May 3rd with the first of five episodes to close out its fourth season. The series is as good as it’s always been — shockingly crass but also sharp, easily one of the funniest and most inventive shows on television. As a cultural object, however, there have been problems around its fans. You know, they’re terrible.,It’s been ,, fueled by a comment that went viral on Reddit. “You have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty,” the post begins, claiming that much of its humor would go over the average viewer’s head. “People who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase ‘Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,’ which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic ,Like anything so obviously Online, it’s impossible to tell if this post is sincere or satire, but it definitely struck a chord. The fan reputation can be so prevailing that enjoying the show often feels as if you need to be at least a little self-aware in your fandom. When I asked a friend if he watched , a few weeks ago, he replied: “Yes, but wokely.” ,Part of that reputation is earned. , fans have a documented history of being extremely annoying — most notably, when an episode mentioned a discontinued McDonald’s Szechuan sauce and said fans began ,. (When the chain brought back the sauce for a limited time, fans were then upset ,.),But some of that reputation comes from the behind-the-scenes dynamic of the show; in the lead-up to season 2, , noted that there were no women on the writing staff, and creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon made jokes about it in response. ,“They make my wee-wee feel weird,” said Roiland. ,“I blame them for the inflation , the recession at the same time,” Harmon continued to riff. “They don’t ask for directions, and they leave the toilet seat down.”,After chalking it up to oversight, they corrected the writers’ room homogeneity by staffing Jane Becker, Erica Rosbe, Sarah Carbiener, and Jessica Gao in one big spree for the show’s third season. Misogynistic fans reacted predictably with much whining online that quickly gave way to actual harassment, compelling Harmon to ,. (Harmon, it should be noted, has also very publicly confronted ,.) The outrage was further proved baseless and embarrassing when Gao wrote “Pickle Rick,” one of the show’s fan-favorite episodes.,But fandoms don’t spring forth from the ether, and ,’s status as an Adult Swim show is part of the problem. Cartoon Network’s late-night programming block notoriously , for most of its existence, and former creative director Mike Lazzo ,. (Lazzo retired in December 2019.) It’s hard, then, to be surprised when the bulk of its audience isn’t supportive of people the network only showed interest in recently. ,Like working in an excellent cafe with poor ventilation, the stench of that grease clings to you, an unpleasant reminder of what was actually a pretty nice time. It can feel strange to publicly be into a show that has some truly bad fans — but it can be done if you are delicate about it and completely abandon the hard sell. No aggressive superlatives. Don’t call it “the best / funniest / smartest show on television,” even if you have a pretty solid argument for that. No shock and / or surprise that the other party hasn’t seen it yet or doesn’t know about parts that they would really enjoy.,Instead, focus on something specific and work on your noncommittal voice, like you’re trying to sound cool in high school by showing off how much you don’t actually care. Say you like , because it’s weird, and you like being surprised every time you hit play or that you just love trying to spot the voices of the , guest stars that roll through or that you really like gross jokes about farts and genitalia, and you didn’t know how clever someone could be with them until you saw ,. But say it all with a kind of shrug, like what you ,want to say is “just live your truth.”,Given the state of , fandom, this is probably the safest approach to practicing fandom: soft sells only. You don’t have to feel bad about liking it, but you don’t need to express pride in your good taste either. ,Rick and Morty,Hearthstone: Heroes of WarCraft,It can feel annoying to have to adjust your approach to account for the bad behavior of a subset of fans, but the whole point of being a (good, not-toxic) fan of something is sharing something you like with other people, and that means being concerned with how they think and feel first, and then showing them that they might enjoy the same things as you. While bad fans don’t have to be a reason for you to give up on something you like, they are a perfectly good reason for anyone else to not pay attention. ,This is the easiest way to transcend a fandom problem — by being a sort of anti-fan. Be quieter about it, less about “fandom” the concept and more about fandom as one of dozens of tiny connections you have with the things you enjoy. It’s nice to like things! It’s less nice to like them because ,Anyway, you should watch this ,show if you want. Dude turns himself into a pickle. He’s called Pickle Rick. It’s hilarious. No pressure, though. "

Netflix miniseries Hollywood isn’t the inspiration it thinks it is,"
          May  5, 2020, 12:36pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"There’s a scene in , for ,, a musical about the life of P.T. Barnum, where Hugh Jackman grins at Zach Efron for saying he does not know what “show business” is. “That’s because I’ve just invented it,” he tells him, cheekily. Like a zombie show where the characters somehow do not know what zombies are, this little bit of irony is fun or grating, depending on the type of person you are. But hardly anyone wants to deal with an entire show full of that. ,, a new Netflix miniseries from Ryan Murphy, is an entire show full of that.,Murphy is perhaps the buzziest maker of television in the business. With this latest project, the writer / director (who co-created the series with frequent collaborator Ian Brennan), who is behind shows like , and , brings his distinct slick, sensational style to the Golden Age of showbiz. Bawdy and transgressive, it starts with a flair and energy that’s hard to look away from, tremendously watchable from minute one. Trouble is, it’s impossible to parse what the show wants to even be ,.  , is an alt-history story about a cast of mostly fictional strivers trying to make it big in 1940s Los Angeles. Just about every core cast member we’re introduced to — writer Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope), director Raymond Ainsley (Darren Criss), actress Camille Washington (Laura Harrier), among others — are from marginalized backgrounds. They’re gay, women, not white, or some combination of the three. They are, by design, people who would have never, ever stood a chance in Old Hollywood, at least not without finding some way to pass. This is the first aim of the show: a rewrite of the well-worn dream-big story, but one starring people who weren’t allowed to be a part of it, and one where they win. ,But the series isn’t just a rosy what-if fable. ,also has ambitions of being a much-needed corrective to our overly simplistic view of the Hollywood that was. The show echoes works like , and the book / documentary ,, offering a look into a more hedonistic side of the Golden Age of show business. This Hollywood was not carefully laundered for mass consumption, a Dreamland where big-name stars had hookups arranged by fixers that conducted business out of a gas station front and secretly gay and bisexual actors and producers threw exclusive parties where they could be secrets no longer. ,In this, the miniseries wants to have its cake and eat it, too. , shows the era for its ugliness — the homophobia, racism, and sexism that shut out marginalized talent for decades — and dreams a new dream where it wasn’t enough to stop our heroes. But its other goal of disabusing viewers of the wholesome myth embodied by the films of the era gets incredibly messy fast. ,Part of the problem is that , is not entirely built around fictional characters. Real names enter and leave the drama throughout, from Hattie McDaniel (Queen Latifah) to Anna May Wong (Michelle Krusiec), real people who did the impossible present to bolster the egos of characters that never existed and therefore, arguably, their creators. Then there’s Henry Wilson (an impressively nasty Jim Parsons), a real-life talent agent who was famous for developing the era’s leading men. He was also, as ,makes , clear, alleged to be the Harvey Weinstein of his day, coercing young men into sex in exchange for parts and stardom. On the show, one of those men is the aspiring actor whom Wilson turns into Rock Hudson — a curious choice since the show barely seems interested in the real Rock Hudson’s biography. ,It’s hard not to see the twin ambitions of , as utterly at odds with each other. The truth-telling of its nastier side inspired by the real version of history undercuts the earnestness of its wish-fulfillment, making it seem cloying and saccharine. In turn, that earnest part of the show makes its forays into Old Hollywood’s real-world underbelly feel exploitative and cheap. There is too much friction between the two for them to build a cohesive whole, and, as a result, the whole enterprise is compromised at best and condescending at worst. ,Like most people involved in the Hollywood of the real world, the characters of , are utterly convinced that everything they’re doing is ,important. They make dreams real, you see, telling stories so that others can see them and be inspired to believe that they can do it, too. We , to have a version of this story where the marginalized succeed because we need them to inspire a more diverse future version of Hollywood so that Hollywood can go on. ,But the show ,wants you to know that it represents a business where abusers thrive, sex can be traded for power, and bigoted men can build systems that protect their interests and extend their reach. That’s just as much a part of show business as the brown kid who gets it in their head that they can make it, matter just as much as the white ones, and become an example that inspires countless others back home. It’s telling that while ,’s marginalized characters find success, its biggest abuser is ambiguously reformed, allowed to stay in the business of dreams after only a few scenes of feeling sorry about it all. ,These are two sides of the same coin: the pernicious reach of the powerful and the inspiring success stories that launder their reputation. In tying the two together once more, the series just props up the old system it thinks it’s subverting. Hollywood’s greatest production has always been Hollywood. "

Distributing Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, and Comedy Central via YouTube, a platform their audience is on, could help reach viewers not purchasing cable packages or tuning into linear television.,The increase in channels coming to YouTube TV, however, could potentially precipitate a hike in monthly cost for the service.

These deals, on top of others that Google has made with companies like WarnerMedia (YouTube TV ,), a potential price hike isn’t out of the question. ,Adding more channels means more costs for Google, but YouTube TV is a growing business that Google wants to invest in. CEO Sundar Pichai called YouTube TV an “exciting product” for the company in a ,, adding that it has “long run value” for the company because it “brings our advertising products together including being able to serve it across TV.” YouTube TV currently has more than two million subscribers. ,“So we are clearly investing in areas where we see opportunity,” Pichai said. “We are pretty thorough about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side.

The whole thing felt a bit like a heist movie in reverse — it’s about a superintendent who’s stealing money from his school district, only you’re watching as the crime unravels, rather than as it plays out.,It’s a fun film, in large part thanks to Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney taking on some big characters. But the movie also takes the course a lot of true-story movies do, where they worry more about telling you what happened than they do about building characters.,I think this works to a point. It’s a wild story, and they do an entertaining job telling it. But I wish the film pushed a little further into who these people are. Showing the crime only as it’s unraveled is a cool way to tell the story, but it also means we don’t get to learn much about what anyone is doing until it’s a bit too late.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Almost a decade after leaving ,, Steve Carell has a new sitcom. While , is a workplace comedy, and Carell is once again playing a boss, he’s taking on a very different role than Michael Scott.

Rick and Morty’s Chris Parnell thinks Jerry would do very well in quarantine,"

After a career in improv,  two stints on ,, and countless roles on sitcoms like , and animated shows like ,, Parnell has perfected the art of using his extremely average appearance — and voice — to deliver disarmingly strange, ridiculous and deadpan comedy. Few are better at making the act of looking like a relatively normal dude and keeping a straight face so , (,).,This is why, as Jerry Smith, Parnell is an essential part of what makes , work. His ability to adopt an aw-shucks affectation even as he bears witness to some of the most bizarre things committed to animation makes him one of the most endearing aspects of the show.,Recently, Parnell spoke with,in a phone call from Los Angeles, where the actor is currently self-quarantined with his family, for a conversation about Jerry’s quarantine odds, ,fans, and what he’s up to during isolation. ,This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.,: You know, every time that I do it after it’s been a long break, I have to find it a little bit, but the voice is not that different than my voice and it’s just sort of tapping into Jerry. But the writing is so good, it’s so much of joy on the page and what the writers create so that it’s really just kind of trying to bring that to life. As long as I’m true to that and being present while I’m recording and all that, it’s not too challenging to get back into Jerry.,Pretty much everything that I do is just solo record sessions, which I enjoy. The hardest thing I think is just remembering to really be present and try to act it well and not just kind of say the lines. So there’s a fair bit of visualization going on in my head and trying to sort of put myself in that place and see it. And it’s very freeing in that there’s no camera on me, so it doesn’t matter what I’m doing with my hands and arms and the way I’m gesticulating or whatever, which I do a fair bit of when I record voiceover. So you’re really just taking all of this energy and funneling it through your voice without being able to see anything which you’re doing physically. Although, obviously, what I do physically with my face and my body is going to affect how my voice sounds.,But yeah, I mean, I feel lucky that I get to do both things. Both the live action and the animated stuff. Obviously, these days it tends to be mostly the animation, but I get to do enough guest star appearances on sitcoms or the occasional movie part or things like that. I get to have that one-on-one interaction with other actors actually with us looking at each other and saying things to each other, so that’s very nice to get to do both.,Would I? Sure. I mean, I probably have at some level. I mean, I’ve certainly done a lot of characters that are ,.,I don’t think so, honestly. Not to be Mr. Tough Guy, but when you’ve had a background doing The Groundlings like I have and once you do live improv shows and stuff like that, there’s really... almost anything goes. And then ,. I mean, people who have been a part of comedy for an extended period of time, as I’ve been fortunate enough to be, for the vast majority of us anyway, there’s not really much that shocks us. Part of doing comedy is doing things that are shocking and surprising and ridiculous, so I don’t know I’ve ever actually encountered anything with Jerry that I was like, “Oh boy. Wow.”,I don’t interact with fans a lot mainly because I’m not on social media, and the only real time for that interaction is at the occasional convention, like Comic-Con or whatever that Adult Swim will send us to. And that’s awesome and that’s really fun and that’s a great time to get to see the crowd react to the screening of an episode or in doing a panel and hearing their questions, so it becomes tangible in a way that it’s not usually. ,But I actually find it freeing to not have to try to do something for an immediate audience reaction and just sort of hope that what I’m doing is funny or whatever it’s supposed to be. And once it’s all put together and animated — obviously, the animation is a big part of it — that people will react in a good way and laugh at [Jerry]. I don’t mind not having that immediate reaction, in a strange way.,I don’t, really. I mean, occasionally I’ll hear that somebody is being nasty or misogynistic or something, but I don’t... other than the broad colors like that. I know that’s very much the minority, but yeah, I don’t have a huge sense of what it’s like.,Yeah? I believe that. ,Well, Rick is fairly amoral. He makes a lot of questionable or outright terrible choices, so I guess there’s going to be people that relate to that in a very particular way and sort of revel in that. ,Any time people get really excited and, dare I say, rabid about something, there’s probably going to be some nastiness involved — and also just inherent in, obviously, social media and people communicating without having to be looking at somebody face to face. Then maybe just the nihilistic nature of , and the darkness of it sort of brings something extra out of some of the fans.,My sons are six and three, so they don’t watch ,, even though they do have some of the plushies and little hard plastic figurines. I mean, my six-year-old knows who Mr. Poopy Butthole is, you know? Other than watching the show with my wife and the bit of feedback I get from her, but we don’t really take the show apart or anything. I’m not sure if my sister watches it. My parents definitely don’t. ,Well, I think Jerry would actually do pretty well with it. I think he would just find some little projects to engage himself with and focus on those and feel proud of his little victories he might have. I know he’s going to be taking up, on some level, beekeeping in these upcoming episodes. So yeah, I don’t think it would be too rough on Jerry. ,Well, I’m on the fourth book of the , series by Dan Simmons. I don’t know if you know that at all, but it’s a great, great science fiction series. I mean, just extraordinary. So I’m making my way through the fourth and last book of that series, and then my wife and I, we have to find shows that we both want to watch at night after the kids are in bed. We love John Oliver, like so many people do. We love Bill Maher and Samantha Bee, we’re fans of hers, and we also watch ,and ,. My wife turned me on to those shows back many years ago, and so, although I never thought I’d be watching reality TV, I do. I am now invested slightly in the lives of those women.,Yeah. Yeah. A lot of it I cannot watch. Like, I have no interest in , or certain shows where I just feel like people are not particularly interesting, but yeah. And then lately my wife’s been having these sort of meetups with some of the other ladies in our neighborhood where they’ll just sit out on the street in lawn chairs and keep their distance, their social distance, and chat. But I’m still catching up with this show,,.,Right? I’ve still got a couple more episodes of, what, season 3, I guess? But yeah, that’s a little treat."
HBO is teaming up with Scener to give subscribers the ability to watch TV together,"
          May 14, 2020,  9:00am EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"People stuck in quarantine who might want to watch ,or ,with friends and family have the option to do so using Scener. ,, an online video chatting tool that allows people to sign in to their Netflix accounts to watch movies and TV shows with friends who also subscribe to the services, is adding HBO to people’s viewing options. Anyone with an HBO Now or HBO Go subscription in the United States can boot up the streaming service, create a private virtual theater for up to 20 people, and watch any title. Scener marks the first major partnership between WarnerMedia’s HBO network and an online co-viewing platform. ,Joe Braidwood, Scener’s co-founder, knew that finding an easy way to give people the ability to stream and hang out with their friends online that also worked within the fragile copyright rules crucial to studios and streamers was important. Braidwood just “didn’t predict it would be a pandemic that makes it mainstream,” he told ,“When the pandemic hit, we saw a crazy surge in demand for our product,” Braidwood added. ,It wasn’t long after that various shelter-in-place orders went into effect around the United States. As more people stayed home, WarnerMedia reached out to Scener about a partnership. Scener and WarnerMedia started working together in March. The new partnership accompanies a new design for the site, including a recent update that helps to  ease the stress on Google Chrome browsers running the app.,“We used to overlay the video and social channels, which injected a lot of code at once leading to a lot of stability issues in Netflix,” Braidwood said. “People were running out of memory because so much was happening on one Chrome tab.”,Since the update’s rolled out, Scener’s received a wave of positive feedback. Something it was hopeful for as usage started skyrocketing was seeing active usage increase 15 times on the legacy product, he said. Having HBO on board was added pressure. Co-watching isn’t a new concept, but “the approach that we take is a very safe and compatible with HBO’s vision,” Braidwood said. HBO, a network that deals with its most popular shows winding up on piracy sites hours after episodes air, wants to ensure that subscribers have the opportunity to watch shows with their friends they can’t see, but not at a cost to their network. ,Piracy is, of course, an issue that Hollywood studios and networks think about, but so does Braidwood. Sites like Twitch often play host to pirated content being streamed by individual users. It’s how some ,, one of HBO’s most successful series. Twitch works to take them down, but on Sunday nights when ,was airing, there seemed to be a new stream for every one removed. ,Part of the appeal of watching a show or movie on Twitch and over Discord is socialization through chat. Braidwood thinks of the current moment like the music industry. Napster became a problem the industry was forced to figure out, and part of the solution came in the form of Spotify. ,“It wasn’t until Spotify’s delightful UX and revenue split that the industry started to move past that problem,” Braidwood said. “Yes, people download and pirate movies, and streaming them on Discord and Twitch, but the majority of people don’t have the time or the patience for that. They want a delightful, easy experience.” ,Scener isn’t the only company trying to get ahead of the co-viewing trend. Amazon, which owns Twitch, is letting streamers , that are available on ,, the company’s streaming service. Everyone who wants in on the party has to subscribe to Amazon Prime, similar to how people who use Scener have subscriptions to Netflix, HBO Now, or HBO Go. Studios and streaming platforms are looking at co-viewing now more than ever because the pandemic has created an increase in demand, but Braidwood doesn’t think co-viewing will only stick around while people are at home. ,“There are watershed moments in history where black swan events change human behavior; that couldn’t be more true for America right now,” Braidwood said. “This is one of the first milestones that starts tracking the new path of co-viewing becoming more than just a trend. We think the sky’s the limit.”"
World’s longest-running cartoon switches to reruns due to COVID-19 disruption,"

Netflix’s The Eddy is a can’t-miss trip to Paris — with one bad detour,"
          May 14, 2020,  3:42pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"The most upsetting thing about ,is that it’s already over. Netflix’s latest bingeable show is a limited series, an eight-episode run about a jazz club in Paris. Produced by Academy Award-winning ,and ,director Damien Chazelle (who directed the first two episodes) and written by acclaimed playwright Jack Thorne, ,y feels like it brings something truly new to the , original series the streaming giant has cultivated of late, and it’s one of the most visually rewarding shows in your queue this year. ,The series follows Elliot (André Holland, terrific) as he struggles to keep his jazz club, The Eddy, afloat during a particularly bad time. His house band is on the verge of getting signed, but bad luck keeps getting in the way. His daughter, Julie (Amandla Stenberg), is now living with him after a bad time with her mother in the States, and she’s acting out. There’s a famous producer interested in his band, but he’s flighty, and the band needs some work. And then his partner, Farid (Tahar Rahim), is murdered.,That last bit is easily the worst thing about ,. The show follows this murder plot through its entirety, grafting a half-baked crime drama onto a superb European hangout. Everything that the series might need from a shocking death — an avenue to explore grief and fuel for character implosions — could conceivably be achieved by replacing Farid’s murder with any other sort of unexpected death. That it chooses to commit so fully to this plotline is baffling, with many scenes of cops and heavies and menacing phone calls just rudely making a mess of what’s otherwise extremely good. ,Sometimes, when writing about TV, you have to be careful to avoid criticizing a series for not being what you want it to be, instead of what it is. , sincerely seems like it wants to be a meandering tale that’s mostly about nothing, just hardscrabble music lovers feeling things and making self-destructive choices on a small scale. Why spend an episode on the bassist who suffers through a day as the third wheel between his former love and her new beau? Or another on a singer’s struggle with her self-worth, caught between two men who want to use her talents to advance their careers and a mother who has never even heard the word “boundaries” in her life? Why film Paris so unromantically, with a wonderful, lived-in feeling, with characters that flow from English to French to Arabic? Why work so hard to marry these tiny dramas to such fantastic music? ,And yes, in keeping with Damien Chazelle projects like ,and ,, , is incredibly good at visually conveying what it feels like to perform music: to be in it and making it at once. In directing the first two episodes, Chazelle sets a standard for this that isn’t ,consistently met throughout — you will notice later episodes dial back his frenetic energy a bit — but they all understand what music , to these characters and work hard to make sure you do, too. ,Above all else, , is a show to be experienced. It’s a shame that its gritty crime plot feels like it comes from a different show entirely — one that wants to shock and pull you from one episode to the next, instead of trusting you will simply flow there with the current. But it’s a small price to pay for some wonderful, textured television. "
Quibi will add sharing features as the app struggles to find subscribers,"
          May 11, 2020,  5:35pm EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"To say that Quibi is off to a disastrous start would be an understatement. Co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg attributes “everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus,” he told , , published on Monday. But Katzenberg is hopeful that rolling out new features will help, including giving subscribers the ability to share content from Quibi shows on social media. ,When Quibi launched at the beginning of April, the app blocked sharing to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit. Now, Katzenberg and the team are working on ways to ensure Quibi is “less walled off from the internet.” People will eventually be able to share Quibi content on social media, but there’s no estimated time frame for when that feature will become available. ,(,Verge,),“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right,” Katzenberg said, “but now that there are hundreds of people on there using it, you go, ‘Uh-oh, we didn’t see that.’”,People also ,.

Quibi currently has about 3.5 million app downloads and 1.3 million active users, according to Katzenberg. ,That’s a far cry from Disney Plus’ , and YouTube’s more than 2 billion monthly users, 70 percent of which ,.

The Snowpiercer TV show slows down a thrilling train ride,"
          May 18, 2020,  1:58pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,", Bong Joon-ho’s gripping sci-fi film, doesn’t seem like a natural fit for television. A tense post-apocalyptic story where the remnants of humanity succumb to class warfare on an endlessly running train, the movie was a finely tuned thriller that also succinctly articulated its themes. More of something isn’t always a good thing. You run the risk of diluting it, especially when the leaner medium of TV forces you to reproduce the original on a tighter budget. There are good ways to do this, but TNT’s , series has found probably the most mundane way to pull it off. ,Ironically, the first change in ,’s TV adaptation, despite being a television cliché, is a really good one: making its protagonist a detective. The broad strokes are otherwise mostly the same as the 2014 film. When our climate crisis reaches an untenable state, scientists inadvertently create another one, making the planet inhospitably cold. In order to save humanity, a 1,001-car supertrain is built to endlessly circumnavigate the globe, a place for the human race to ride out the apocalypse — provided they can buy a ticket. Those who do are stratified by wealth, with the rich in luxe cars up front and the poor stowaways who forced their way aboard penned in the back, living in squalor. ,Layton (Daveed Diggs) is one of those “tailies,” eking out a miserable existence as his cohorts plan a revolution. Things are complicated, however, when Layton is recruited by the people in charge because he is the only passenger who was a former homicide detective, and there is a murder that needs solving — one that slowly, over the show’s first season, causes the fraught balance of the Snowpiercer population to fall apart. ,Shifting the story’s perspective to a detective is a smart way to make ,interesting over 10 hour-long episodes. , quickly shows why: Layton’s recruitment allows him to introduce viewers to the world as it’s been re-created aboard the eponymous train, drifting from car to car as the story requires. Check it out: there’s a nightclub car, a twisted morgue where troublesome individuals are put in suspended animation and stashed in drawers, a school car, suites for the first class, okay rooms for fourth class, and so on. ,This is where dilution starts to be a bit of a problem. , wasn’t a terribly subtle film, turning the evils of capitalism into a speeding freight train that hurtles at the viewer, but every way it expounded on its sci-fi future felt vital. As a TV show, , has to be about more things and show the audience more of the world in order to build a longer, serial story. Unfortunately, that longer story is a drag. ,There’s some really good stuff. The third episode, in particular, “Access Is Power,” delves into the train’s circular, closed economy and the way nothing is ever wasted as passengers from front to tail barter everything imaginable in order to get a peek at life above their station. But the majority of ,feels perfunctory. It’s a competent show that’s efficiently made and is steadily working toward its big season-ending goal of revolution, just like the movie. But lacking the urgency of a shorter runtime, it’s not an engrossing experience, just a nice idle one. ,Watching ,, I found myself wishing it was , of a detective show. Something more strictly episodic, with Layton being asked to investigate a different case every week, would give the show’s writers and directors enough to make the show different every episode. Unfortunately, like every passenger on ,, once you’re on this particular train, you’ve got no choice but to barrel ahead toward the same destination as everyone else. The only difference here is you can get off if you want. "

I think I complained in one of these columns recently that, upon rewatching ,y, I felt like its animation was underused, barely scratching the surface of what such a dark, trippy film could do with that dreamy style. , gets it right.,The series does a wonderful job of using its dreamy look to tell a story where characters are constantly going in and out of memories, leaving moments behind only to return to them later, mid-conversation. It’s something that could easily be overdone, but the story keeps it all grounded, even as the visuals help to express just how disorienting and occasionally wonderful the feeling of slipping in and out of time can be.,And ultimately, the show’s characters are just so strong and colorful on their own that it’d be worth watching even if people weren’t constantly slipping through time and space. The rotoscoped style could have distanced us, but instead it gives the actors space to be even more expressive, as the scene focuses us on their eyes, mouth, or hands, making simple motions feel large and impactful.,Check out seven trailers from this week below.,J.J.

"Avatar: The Last Airbender is back on Netflix, but don’t start with the first episode","
          May 21, 2020,  3:41pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera," is back on Netflix after a seven-year absence, and if you never caught the show, now is a perfect time. ,isn’t just one of the best animated series around; it’s full-stop excellent television regardless of format. This might not be clear from episode 1, though. As premieres go, it’s charming but geared toward hooking children. Skepticism is okay! Just don’t pass it by without diving into one of its best episodes, “Zuko Alone” (season 2, episode 7). It’s a standalone tale that explains everything you need to know — a terrific martial arts Western with surprisingly rich characterization and a gut-punch ending — all in 20 minutes. ,In ,there are four nations, each based on the mastery of a different element: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air. The Fire Nation declared war on the others, and the series is about children caught up in this war. Most episodes focus on Aang, the titular Avatar, the only person in the world with the ability to master all four elements and prophesied to restore balance. The only problem: he’s a child and not quite in command of every element yet. Through a mix of standalone and serial episodes, , follows Aang and his young friends as they help him on his journey to master the elements, while pursued by Fire Nation and stymied by adults in power.,“Zuko Alone” focuses on the young Prince Zuko, one of the show’s primary antagonists, exiled from the Fire Nation after a humiliating failure, left to wander on his own. The episode is removed from the show’s highly serialized plot. Like in a good Western, Zuko takes on the archetypal role of The Man With No Name. He arrives at a small frontier town for rest and a meal when he encounters a conflict: crooked Earth Kingdom soldiers are terrorizing the villagers they’re supposed to protect. As a once-proud member of the invading nation, Zuko has been a villain unaccustomed to caring about others. In exile however, his priorities are slowly shifting, and he decides to intervene. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the plot of ,, one of the most beloved and regularly homaged Westerns.) ,In “Zuko Alone,” the former prince finally gets a chance to see what he’s represented all this time to the people outside of the Fire Nation. His internal conflict is externalized by his decision to hide his identity, and the unspoken idea that his new friends might not respond so kindly if they knew who he was. ,One reason , is loved by its fans is the way it refuses to talk down to its audience. Like Phillip Pullman’s YA trilogy ,, it’s a show that rarely simplifies things to “good” or “evil,” letting its protagonists be selfish and wrong at times and giving its antagonists depth whenever possible. In the world of ,, characters are caught between compassion and conflict, and war provides them with regular opportunity to behave nobly or selfishly. That its main characters are all children only underlines all of this. The frequent goofy hijinks and moments of weakness are all normal parts of growing up, and no matter how much we’d like it to be, growing up does not happen in a vacuum. It happens out in the world where there is conflict, war, and pain. The children of , want to be kids, but they’re also inheriting the world of their parents and are just starting to see it for what it is — but they’re not yet jaded enough to stop seeing what it could be. ,This is what makes “Zuko Alone” a good introduction to ,: it’s a small character study of one of these kids, scarred in more ways than one, coming to terms with all manner of consequence — the cost of his decisions, the burden of his place in the world, the limits of his control over how others perceive him, and the potential he still has to become who he wants to be, under his old name or not. ,That’s pretty good stuff for a kid’s show. , "

The eight episodes (the first three are out now, the rest weekly) that follow illustrate how the Richardsons got here, starting with the arrival of Mia Warren (Kerry Washington) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood), two people who get hopelessly tangled in the Richardsons’ lives, inadvertently exposing their worst traits. ,Mia, an artist, leads an itinerant life and has arrived in Shaker Heights with the hopes of giving Pearl a stability they’ve never had together. She leases an apartment from the Richardsons, and over time, she and Pearl slowly become more integrated in their daily life. Pearl attends the same school as the four Richardson children, befriending middle son Moody (Gavin Lewis) and pining after his older brother Trip (Jordan Elsass). Meanwhile, misfit Izzy begins to strike up a relationship with Mia, as Mia and Elena Richardson, the family matriarch, become increasingly wary of the influence each has on the other’s children. ,From here, , slowly starts to simmer, putting each of its cast of privileged white characters in situations that gradually escalate until they are forced to finally ditch their preferred euphemisms. Each encounter exposes another way in which they believe themselves to be good and decent because they’ve built a world where their sense of selves are not challenged. Elena’s daughter Lexie thinks herself virtuous for dating a black classmate, Brian, although she swears it doesn’t enter the equation. Elena hires Mia as her housekeeper, willfully ignorant of the race and class dynamics at play by hiring someone who pays her rent. Bill Richardson (Joshua Jackson), Elena’s husband, admonishes her for not getting a background check before offering the apartment to Mia. Elena, repeatedly, compliments herself for what a , she’s doing by helping the Warrens. ,Over and over again, the Warrens collide against the polite racism of those who pride themselves as not racist, and those small collisions slowly build to something catastrophic, as a friend of the Richardsons adopts a Chinese baby whose mother suddenly resurfaces, demanding her child back. It’s a crisis that compels the people in it to directly say what they’ve spent their lives talking around, and the results are not pretty.,While , has its sights set squarely on being a withering takedown of petty suburban class dynamics, it’s also remarkably understanding of the people within it. While its heart lies with the Warrens, every major player is considerably complicated. Elena Richardson is perfectly played by Reese Witherspoon — every passive-aggressive action cheerily delivered, and every boundary violation couched in the language of good intentions. As deft as the characterization is, the series is also interested in the forces that produce it — how a woman’s ambitions are stifled by societal pressures, and how she ultimately can end up reinforcing the boundaries that initially penned her in. ,That depth extends in every direction — Mia, as played by Kerry Washington, is a quiet force of nature, slowly realizing that she has just enough leverage to upend the neatly ordered worlds of the people who don’t know how much power they indiscriminately wield. As her past becomes less of a mystery, viewers begin to understand why she would apply that pressure. Through Pearl, Mia’s heartbreak is felt when the fault lines that she sees are clearly exposed for the first time. Through each of the Richardson children, the costs of perpetuating the life their parents made for them begin to manifest in unexpected ways. ,This is what , most clearly conveys: there are no easy answers, but there are people who benefit from the questions that go unasked. And when things get hard, there will always be people who have the option to make good choices and those who do not. Most times, the world counts on these questions going unasked, under the guise of manners. It’s not , to remind white people that they might benefit from whiteness or that people of color are not afforded the same opportunities. How could you make this about race? They would ,."

Tiger King is a show about how the internet eats us all,"
          Apr  1, 2020,  1:15pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera," is one of the strongest contenders for most watchable TV show of the year, and it’s a problem. A documentary miniseries comprising seven quick episodes, each under an hour, you could watch the whole thing in a weekend; given the subject, you’ll probably finish even faster. ,The Netflix series follows a man both larger than life and smothered by it: Joe Exotic, the one-time owner of a successful-seeming private zoo with over 200 tigers and other big cats. He’s a man who ran for president of the United States, then governor of Oklahoma, and then sometime after, may have tried to hire someone to kill his nemesis, a woman dedicated to shutting his zoo down. It’s incredibly compelling, and terribly so: ,is almost wholly dedicated to spectacle, with little interest in any sense of truth. And the truth is about as gutting as , is sensational.,As the eponymous Tiger King, Joe Exotic is magnetic: a ball-capped, mulleted man who swaggers with a knee brace and a drawl, wearing some combination of fringe vests, chaps, and bedazzled shirts at all times. You’ve never seen anyone on television like him. Born Joe Schreibvogel, the man’s eccentricities are accompanied by a tragic backstory that ,will deliver piecemeal and in passing. For the first few episodes, we meet him more or less fully formed: a man who has built a small empire with his larger-than-life personality and his equally large cats — an empire that, somehow, crumbled and landed him in prison. ,Every minute of , yields some new surprise, an unbelievable turn or charismatic stranger with incredible stories to tell. The documentary plays fast and loose with these anecdotes, as Joe Exotic shows us how he married two men at once, went into business with a guy who snuck tiger cubs into Vegas casinos, or nearly got mauled by one of his own lions. With no warning, the show also veers into immensely dark territory, as its subjects recount manipulative and abusive relationships, a death by suicide, and Joe Exotic’s sustained hate campaign against Carole Baskin, an activist committed to ending big cat ownership in America whom Joe Exotic also believes killed her wealthy husband for money.,As , goes on, its greatest strength — the litany of unbelievable stories it has to share — becomes its most concerning weakness, as the filmmakers don’t really seem to be interested in telling a story about its subjects as they are in milking them dry. There’s little point to , beyond its sensational thrills and credulously presenting everyone it puts in front of a camera. The show does not, for example, present any context for how seriously you should take the allegation that Carole Baskin killed her husband — so now this allegation is fodder for viral tweets, , for the , , that happens to have real-world fallout: new leads in case of Baskin’s missing ex-husband are being ,. ,It’s likely that you will watch , and wonder if there’s more to the story, and you’d be right. A cursory search for facts will likely lead to , feature about the tangled histories of Schreibvogel and Baskin, reconstructing their early lives and detailing their rivalry. Laid out in print, the story is far more sobering than the occasional flashes of somber distress we get on the show. Both Schreibvogel and Baskin are reportedly victims of abuse, dogged by misfortune and embraced by strange circumstances. Truth is elusive in both of their lives; Schreibvogel appears to be a serial fabulist, and Baskin’s public persona has a singular focus, with few public associations beyond the cats she keeps on her preserve. In their orbits, lives are destroyed — the overwhelming number of them sacrifices dedicated to the myth of the Tiger King.,There’s a level of complicity to viral fame that’s hard to square with shows like ,. In the streaming era, interest is often the result of direct action. There’s very little passivity left in how we entertain ourselves. We choose what to watch, what to recommend, and who to listen to, so if something like , is a viral hit, it , organic, like something we’re all talking about because we’re genuinely interested in it. ,Because of this, , becomes content that generates , content on websites and social media, which, in turn, leads more people back to ,. This, then, eventually leads to the extremely online becoming amateur sleuths and flooding Florida tip lines about a decades-old murder case. Through this cycle, suffering becomes sport — something that can be said of a lot of true-crime media — but also a call to action. ,It can be seen in the way the , encourages listeners to adopt a vindictive view of the role of law enforcement or in the entire cottage industry spun out of ,’s first season, which birthed an entertainment empire around the guilt or innocence of Adnan Syed. It’s a phenomenon fueled by our need to seek resolution where there often is none to be found. In the absence of finality, we post into the infinite. The tyranny of the internet bleeds into the real world: if there’s enough content, eventually, that content becomes real life. We are consumed by the tiger king. "

Everyone from Netflix to Disney Plus and HBO Now ,, with global streaming growing 20 percent in the same time, but Netflix is one of the only global options.  ,Television, when executed properly, can do more than just entertain.

"Amazon Prime Video now allows in-app rentals and purchases on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV","

        ",Nick Statt,"Amazon’s Prime Video iOS and Apple TV apps now let customers make in-app purchases, including renting and buying films and TV shows. The change marks a huge shift in Amazon’s approach to the App Store, which mandates a 30 percent cut on all in-app purchases. ,Prior to the change, Amazon would not allow you to rent or buy content on the Prime Video app, instead, directing users to a web browser to avoid the App Store fee. You could still sign up for a Prime Video subscription through the iOS app if you are not an Amazon Prime subscriber, but even then, you could not make individual content purchases from within the app. ,Now, when users log in to the Prime Video app, there should be a message reading, “Browse, rent, or buy new release movies, popular TV shows, and more — now within the app.” (Big thanks to George Watson, who tipped us off to this change.) ,The prices do not appear to have been raised to account for the 30 percent fee, as ,. It was not immediately clear whether Amazon reached a deal with Apple or whether it is indeed deciding to pay the full cut. But Apple has since confirmed that it entered Amazon Prime Video into an established program for “premium” video providers. ,“Apple has an established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers to offer a variety of customer benefits — including integration with the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on,” Apple said in a statement given to ,. “On qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Atlice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.” ,Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ,In the new Prime Video app, which does not require an update, there’s now a full-blown store tab at the bottom. It features lists of popular and new movies to buy or rent, including many of the recently released films like ,and , that were in theaters in February and March but ,. ,According to user reports and Apple’s statement, Amazon is processing purchases using its own stored payment methods and through its own processor so long as a user has an Amazon account with that information on file. That’s a notable change in how all forms of in-app purchases have been handled before. ,Typically, Apple takes its 30 percent fee and handles all payment, processing, and security upfront — Apple takes only 15 percent from subscriptions so long as a customers signed up for the services within the iOS app and has maintained it for more than a year. ,According to app developer Guilherme Rambo, the Prime Video app began using a special request related to payment processing that first suggested an arrangement between Amazon and Apple, prior to Apple confirming the new program.,According to ,’s Mark Gurman, the deal struck between Amazon and Apple is not a wholly unique one; it’s been in place for some time although it is unclear when it was started. The program allows a company to use its own payment methods, Gurman says, and it’s already in use by apps from more niche premium video providers like Altice One and Canal+. ,Gurman, in a , published after the change, later explained that the program also extends to supporting a number of Apple apps, services, and features — including the “Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on,” according to Apple’s statement.,Regardless of how long this program has existed and the exact terms of the deal that was struck between the two companies, the change should remove a long-lasting headache to buying and renting movies and shows through Amazon’s app and on Apple TV. ,Bloomberg"

There are three moments in the movie where music plays, and in all three cases, you don’t see its origin (a piano, singers, an orchestra) until well after the music begins, if at all.

"Quibi’s shows are fun, familiar, and a little forgettable","
          Apr  6, 2020,  8:42am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"It’s far too easy to make fun of Quibi. That’s the first problem. You can start with the name: an overly cute mashup of “quick bites.” It’s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to — hence a bizarre , dedicated to explaining it. It’s Netflix, but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt, yet brief enough that you wouldn’t turn to anything but your phone. You know: waiting in lines, pausing to sip a coffee, sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something. That’s Quibi’s second problem: it was created for a world that doesn’t really exist anymore, one put on hold by a pandemic. ,This makes Quibi a harder sell. TV to watch while you’re doing something else doesn’t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on. However, the contrary can , be true: we’re all staring at our phones anyway, so what’s another reason to do it some more? As of today, there are 24 reasons, each Quibi show delivered in installments of 10 minutes or less, each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream. There are 72 snacks in search of a meal.,The content — normally a crass word for art but an apt one for Quibi — runs the gamut, with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven’t really seen before. There’s a , revival starring Chance the Rapper, a series called , where Offset is really into cars and car stunts, a remake of ,starring Liam Hemsworth, and ,, a truly bizarre show where Will Arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the YouTube clip yourself. ,(,The Verg,Polygon,Verge,.),Quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone; almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations. I checked this, incessantly, with every show I watched. There’s something mind-boggling about it, the way Quibi tries to have things literally both ways. It works well enough, but there are strange side effects. In scripted shows, the dual-composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time, and that can make a serious drama feel shallow. In unscripted shows, this adds a layer of uncanniness, as slick network production clashes with a visual composition that’s thoroughly associated with influencers and lo-fi meme makers. You can, ironically, gauge how good a Quibi show is by how well it plays in vertical orientation. ,The majority of Quibi’s programming is the sort of stuff you can find on regular TV, just broken up into smaller pieces. , is a reality show in the vein of , in seven-minute chunks. , , feels like a USA drama, delivered one plot development at a time. , actually , a TV show long before Quibi, but someone figured it might play better if you didn’t have to spend 30 minutes with it. (They were right.) ,Quibi’s best shows are the ones that feel most like they could only happen on Quibi. There’s not a lot of that in the launch lineup, but perhaps the best example is ,, a ,-style courtroom show in which Chrissy Teigen is a courtroom judge mediating exclusively petty disputes, like who got someone a better Lizzo-themed sweater. It’s the perfect Quibi show — like a TikTok that got a little out of hand, but it ends just before it stops being funny. ,Another, ,, features comedians Matt Rogers and Dave Mizzoni as hosts in a competition. In every episode, two different straight men will compete to see who is the better queer ally. Again, it’s a bit that’s perfectly pitched for the platform. It’s savvy and effective, with stunts loud enough to hold your attention and talent deft enough to keep it. (It also might be the most genuinely funny show on Quibi so far.),Documentaries also fare pretty well on Quibi. The standout is ,, about LeBron James’ I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, which serves at-risk children with an approach that’s equal parts social work and education. Compelling, frank, and moving, each eight-minute installment absolutely flies by. ,Still, there’s a frivolousness to Quibi that none of its programming can seem to shake because the platform was built for frivolity. I could put on a Quibi show and keep up with it just fine while writing a grocery list, chopping garlic, or brushing my teeth and only glancing at it. Once, I almost put on a Quibi show while watching something else on my TV. ,For this reason, Quibi’s best point of comparison is podcasts, not streaming TV. It’s a medium for filling space that you probably already had filled with something else, but for some reason, you got it in your head that you should be , something in that time. It exists in a nebulous space between the steady dopamine rush of TikTok’s constant supply of novelty and the chill, lackadaisical time-sink of Twitch. Boredom is the constant, and it’s most often resolved by habit. This then, is the platform’s biggest ask: can you change your habits to accommodate it?,Because Quibi is designed to be habitual. New episodes are scheduled to drop every day, and new shows will premiere “every single Monday,” per Quibi. It’s a steady stream of quick bites coming from an endless bag of treats. Even in a world shut down by circumstance, Quibi is an interesting idea, one that wants us to use our phones the way we already do, like fidget spinners with Wi-Fi or a smoke break we can take anywhere. But that’s the third problem: no one remembers a snack. They remember a really good dinner. "

Michael Scott’s outbursts in ,don’t transition well to Slack, where the equivalent is a message typed out in all-caps. That’s not as funny. ,Videoconferencing has also never been easier. Services like Zoom allow remote workers to talk face-to-face, all from the safety and comfort of their own homes. In December 2019, Zoom saw heights of 10 million daily users — by March 2020, Zoom was hitting “more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid,” ,“We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. ,Companies have transitioned quickly from operating in physical spaces to moving everything online. Zoom is hitting record-breaking numbers, as is Microsoft Teams, a group chat and collaboration tool from Microsoft that rivals Slack. Slack is no different. CEO Stewart Butterfield shared numbers in a lengthy tweet thread, noting that on Tuesday, March 10th, Slack’s concurrent users passed 10 million. That number jumped to 10.5 million just six days later, reaching 12.5 million on March 25th. ,“We have an incredible business that has been growing very quickly and that will continue to do so for many, many years to come,” Butterfield told Slack employees, as seen in ,. “We provide a platform that is going to become even more useful to the world in the years to come.” ,This pandemic will forever change parts of our lives, much like the 1918 influenza did more than 100 years ago. A big part of that will be the physicality of work. “The age of the office as we know it is probably over, and the bell can’t be unrung,” Matt Burr, CEO at Nomadic Learning, ,. More employees, once ready to commute into an office every day, will use tools like Slack and Zoom to work from home more often, according to Burr. Companies will see less of a reason to have physical space and will use remote advantages to build teams in different cities. ,Work has changed, and television will follow. Pop culture has always reflected our lives at a certain moment in time. Similar to how we revisit ,or ,to scratch the nostalgic itch for times when families were corny and homely or marathoning shows like ,and ,to reminisce about a time when people actually hung out, ,yearns for simpler times. Actress Angela Kinsey (who played Angela Martin on the show) described the series as inexplicably comforting. That comfort comes from the normalcy of a work routine — something I’ve come to miss in the weeks I’ve been at home. ,Less than 20 years ago, people worked in offices. Now, many of us work from home. Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein, co-producers on ,, are developing a new workplace comedy, but this one won’t include characters like Dwight and Jim throwing pencils at each other over their computers. Instead, the show is about a “wunderkind boss who, in an effort to ensure his staff’s connectedness and productivity, asks them all to virtually interact and work face-to-face all day,” , ,We’ve walked toward this change in work culture for years, but now it’s here for millions of people. The pandemic didn’t suddenly flip a switch; it proved that people can — and will — work without an office. Last year, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 26 million Americans, or approximately 16 percent of the total workforce, work from home. Imagine if half of ,’s cast suddenly stopped showing up because they could conduct calls at home and check in with co-workers online. Between 2005 and 2015, employees who telecommuted rose by 115 percent, the bureau reported.,Those years also happen to represent ,s run. As ,went off the air, so did the idea that day-to-day work would look the same as it did in 2005. More than 55 million people are gig workers who don’t have offices to go to, more people are set to work from home than ever, and an entire generation of employees may not experience that type of work setting — one considered universal less than 20 years ago. That’s the future pop culture will incorporate. There’s something poetic about ,’s co-producers being some of the first to try. ,“Start with the office comedy, lose the office and you’re just left with comedy,” co-producer Lieberstein told ,. “The math works.” ,In the meantime, many of us are at home, so lonely that we are wistfully streaming old episodes of ,, longing for the Dwight Schrutes in our lives, wishing they could do something annoying enough that we could turn to another colleague for just a moment and roll our eyes."

Tales from the Loop turns small-town America into a sci-fi feelings machine,"
          Apr  6, 2020, 10:50am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"is so pretty it breaks your heart. Based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, famous for his scenes of pastoral tranquility draped around uncanny sci-fi sights, ,’s newest drama is a collection of eight short stories where everyday rural life is tinged with the supernatural. But unlike, say, ,, where the otherworldly takes center stage, , uses it as an excuse to dig deeper into the people who must continue to live mundane lives, even as the extraordinary looms just inches away. ,While , features a recurring cast of characters and overlapping plots, each episode functions as a standalone short story. Since critics were sent three out-of-order episodes for review, it’s safe to assume that continuity isn’t really a concern for the show; just consider it , with every episode set in the same town. ,And what a town it is! The series takes place in a fictional Ohio neighborhood built above The Loop, a machine built to “explore the mysteries of the universe.” The Loop is massive, and, while it employs most of the residents who live above it, few know the full extent of what goes on within its confines. All they know is that the work done there has changed the texture of their lives. Some of these changes are overt and intentional, like advances in technology that make robotic limbs, hovering tractors, and walking mechs commonplace. ,Other phenomena are less intentional: strange, inexplicable sightings; objects that appear out of thin air; fluctuations in space and time. In the ecosystem of this small Midwestern town, The Loop is an invasive exotic, reshaping the balance of life and nature around it. And everyone there has to just roll with it because they have no choice. Besides, sometimes The Loop has its benefits. ,In the episodes provided in advance, a girl’s mother disappears and leaves behind a strange artifact in “Loop,” a boy hears voices coming from a strange globe in “Echo Sphere,” and in “Parallel,” a man stumbles into another universe. What follows each is a tender drama that feels like a play, each devoted mostly to loneliness. ,Each character, at least in the episodes screened, yearns for connection. While “Loop” is set in motion by a disappearance, it’s really about distance, as the girl’s search for her missing parent serves as a window into how they became strangers to each other. “Parallel” shows a man meeting himself in another universe, but it chooses character drama over genre thrills as the two versions of the same man attempt to befriend one another. Over and over, , gestures at some inarticulate sadness and shows its characters trying to work through it. ,It’s not that big of a stretch from Stålenhag’s art, which is overwhelmingly melancholic in the way it juxtaposes the mundane and the fantastic. Transposed from its original Swedish context to an American one, that sorrow takes on new wrinkles. The Loop puts boundless potential literally within arm’s length of small-town Ohio, and yet, its denizens lead more or less the same lives they’d live without it. People still work in what seem like dead-end jobs, they have trouble tilling their fields, they don’t see their families enough. Through the eyes of a set of acclaimed directors — Ti West, Charlie McDowell, So Yong Kim, and Mark Romanek each helm an episode — every moment feels delicate and human, and despair never overwhelms wonder. ,is an understated work in a time when more muted stories are easily swallowed up in the wealth of available options. It’s worth making the time for, though. These are slow stories about how technology was never going to fix us no matter how promising it seems. We still have to go the slow route and try to fill the void in ourselves by reaching out to others. "
"The Good Fight can and will do anything to get your attention, and it’s damn good at it","
          Apr 10, 2020, 11:56am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"One of the benefits of having a TV show on a streaming platform is something few actually take advantage of: you can more or less do anything. Freed from the shackles of broadcast ratings, once a streaming show is greenlit for a season, it’s basically guaranteed that season. ,, a legal drama on CBS All Access, has spent three years playing by no rules other than its own, upending everything you might expect from a legal drama to become one of the most slept-on shows out there. Its season 4 premiere, out this week, is the series at its most absurd and most incisive. ,To understand ,’s audacity, you have to know where it comes from. The first episode of , began with the Trump presidency. The show, a legal drama spun out of , (you don’t really need to watch that to enjoy this one) leaned into this. Its first scene featured protagonist Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a wealthy, successful lawyer, watching the inauguration and swearing. Then, she makes plans: she quits her job and makes preparations to run off to Italy, where she can ignore the looming political carnival. Things don’t go as planned, and she’s stuck here with the rest of us — her money gone, her former firm shutting her out, and her old way of life upended. ,She’s hired by a law firm owned by black partners, and , turns its premise on its head. Instead of being a story about a wealthy white woman dealing with Trump’s America, it’s about her confronting just how different that America is — and always was — for people of color. ,Perhaps that makes the series sound didactic, like it’s serving civic vegetables. And while it’s cathartic to see the writers handle topical issues like ICE’s lack of accountability or the consequences of a record number of barely qualified judges being approved by Congress, , is also unbelievably ,. Like any good courtroom drama, its cases are full of moves and countermoves that make each episode feel like a dance, and it’s frequently laugh-out-loud funny. One of the most memorable characters is Roland Blum (Michael Sheen), and amoral, fentanyl-sucking sleaze who blows through the show’s universe like a dirtbag hurricane that feels too cartoonish to be true. Then you notice he appears in an episode called “The One Inspired by Roy Cohn” and realize that he is, in fact, inspired by Roy Cohn. ,At its best, ,’s jokes always have a little bite. ,Take this season premiere as an example. In a completely out-of-nowhere twist, Diane wakes up to find she is in another universe where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, and she’s the only one who remembers the timeline where Trump did. Again, I must stress that ,is a legal drama. It does , dabble in science fiction or the multiverse or alternate timelines. And yet, that’s what the premiere does because , decided it had to make a point, one that it maybe didn’t underline well enough in previous episodes and one that feels especially resonant in an election year: the problems do not begin and end with the person in the White House. People have blind spots. , excels at satire that is both over-the-top and incredibly sharp — a talent that has made it the first truly good series about the Trump era, even as it continues to unfold. It’s a show that’s not afraid to be ridiculous in an effort to underscore the absurdity of the times, while affixing its drama to underappreciated stories ripped from headlines that the news cycle glosses over all too quickly. The thread tying this season together, for example, involves a top-secret memo that allows the rich to completely opt out of the legal process, a plotline clearly lifted from last year’s long line of Trump associates who simply refused to comply with subpoenas — a criminal offense. ,But perhaps the biggest reason ,resonates is in how it takes advantage of its case-of-the-week structure to continually widen its lens to look at how the systemic corruption of the judicial system is felt by people beyond its world of lawyers, who, by nature of their profession, must continually compromise. Sometimes it falters in this, reflecting the blindspots of the characters it usually is self-aware about. One season gets a little too mired in a #Resist plot, and in another, the , pee tape appears. (Yes, , pee tape. What other one could we possibly be talking about?),Yet, on the whole, , doesn’t want the rich and powerful to be the only ones writing the story of our surreal, nightmarish present. It knows that the justice system is hopelessly compromised, and it isn’t naive enough to think it can be fixed from the inside. The good guys can’t always win, but they can leave a record. "

"Zoom became Saturday Night Live’s breakout star in historic all-digital, remote episode ","
          Apr 12, 2020, 10:32am EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"“Live from Zoom, it’s ,” isn’t a phrase people ever assumed NBC’s quintessential late-night show would ever open with, but then again, most people likely weren’t using ,.,The breakout star of ,’s unprecedented remote episode was the video conferencing tool tens of millions of people are using while working from home. It wasn’t just a casual throwaway line in a sketch during ,’s most recent episode. It wasn’t just a venue where the show was filmed, standing in as a digital replacement for Studio 8H at 30 Rock in New York City. Zoom became a cast member in its own right as the ,team worked remotely to put together a 90-minute show for Saturday night. There was a dedicated Zoom sketch, constant jokes that ended with Zoom punchlines, and an impressive Weekend Update segment all done using the productivity software. ,Like everyone else stuck working from home, the cast of ,was also left to figure out a way to remain productive in an extremely abnormal time. For ,, that means there aren’t any sophisticated props, costumes, or audio and visual effects to carry gags. It’s a group of people sitting in front of their webcams, trying to think of witty one-liners. Zoom provides the bare-bones of what regular people need to continue working remotely, but as a venue for the show, it stripped down a form of entertainment reliant on a number of external factors into nothing but sheer drive from comedians to ,. ,The big question is did it work? Not always, but ,rarely produces a show with nothing but outstanding sketches. As guest host Tom Hanks, who recently recovered from the coronavirus, said in his opening monologue, “It’s , — there will be some good stuff, maybe one or two stinkers.” Or to steal a traditional showbiz phrase, the show must go on. Ensuring that show goes on is much easier with a multi-billion dollar conglomerate behind it (,airs on NBC, which is a division of NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast) even without the props, cameras and sets its budget usually provides.,That was obvious in the sketches that made it to air. If Zoom was the stage, the format was more in line with what people might expect out of a YouTube upload or viral video on Twitter. Last night’s ,more closely resembled TikTok than the live show fans are used to, but with even more limitations. There wasn’t any physical comedy to drive home jokes — no spit takes, exaggerated falling, or weird body contortions. Outside of a couple of sketches, there weren’t even major collaborations among the comedians — a staple of , and the element that makes it a variety sketch show. ,Instead, comedians filmed from their bedrooms and basements. Kate McKinnon included her cat. Pete Davidson filmed on his street in suburban Staten Island, in front of a house he shares with his mom. They used makeshift green screen backgrounds on Zoom for any kind of visual gag. Technology effectively replaced physical props, becoming just as much a creative crutch, a safety blanket in the form of Zoom audio issues and Twitch live stream setups, as it was a means for distribution. ,That means certain sketches fell flat. Although ,has moved toward incorporating more digital sketches throughout the years, those are still based around multiple people appearing together. Since that was impossible for last night’s episode, ideas that might have worked well if there was more than one person in a video, didn’t have the same magic. Pete Davidson rapping about Drake’s new song in his basement is one example. ,Other ideas managed to pull it off by leaning into the format. Heidi Gardner’s popular Weekend Update character, a Bailey, finally got to record an entire episode of her movie review show on YouTube. Mikey Day became a Twitch streamer who sucks at ,in another sketch. Aidy Bryant used different Zoom backgrounds to guide viewers on a meditation journey. Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney (alongside special guest Fred Armisen) used a FaceTime call to turn a conversation into a song. It’s in these instances where ,zoomed in on the absurdity of our lives right now that jokes really landed, pun not intended.,Last night’s episode was one of the show’s most heartfelt, even if all-digital, remote episodes are not its future. ,couldn’t have accomplished what it did last night without the technology that allowed the team to collaborate, record, and edit from home, or without enough recognizable instances of daily tech use in our lives for ,to riff on. The things that ,managed to poke fun at — Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, FaceTime, Zoom — only work because tens of millions of people use them daily. ,found its moment of normalcy in satirizing the technology that brings us together right now — an attempt to redefine normal reflected in our own lives around the world.

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"Netflix , a first-look deal with comics publisher Boom Studios for new TV series based on Boom’s comic book franchises, giving the streaming service another avenue for intellectual property based on which it can create new shows.,While not nearly as large as big-name publishers like Marvel, DC, or Image Comics, Boom Studios is still one of the most popular comic book companies in the world, producing major franchises like ,,,,,,,,,and ,.,With the new deal, Netflix gets access to a wealth of franchises and series from Boom’s original lineups to turn into new TV shows, something that Netflix badly needs in the increasingly tribalistic streaming wars.

Narcos: Mexico is a show for people who want the drug war to last forever,"
          Feb 14, 2020,  3:34pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"started as a show about Pablo Escobar, a real-life gangster who outdid even the most outrageous fictional ones. The show built a compelling two-season crime thriller around his astonishing life and death. But while Escobar died, , — a hit that premiered in 2015, when Netflix was rapidly building its streaming empire — needed to go on. A third season followed another Colombian cartel. Then a spinoff, ,, tracked a parallel cartel in Central America. The first season detailed its rise; the second chronicles its fall. If there was any point to all this, it’s become hard to keep track of. The show is too busy following the cocaine., is the story of Mexico’s first drug kingpin, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (Diego Luna). The 10 episodes that premiere this week detail the dramatic implosion of Gallardo’s empire, a collapse that makes for extremely bingeable television. Yet, despite the thrilling spectacle, exhaustion seeps in. Even though it aims at being something more, , doesn’t seem to have ambitions far beyond those of the criminals it follows, pushing more product. ,The second season of , wants to make a point about consequences, at least on a surface level. The collapse of Gallardo’s empire stems directly from brash actions taken during his ascent — most directly, the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña), which sends agent Walt Breslin on a reckless mission of retribution. There are also bridges burned along the way, friendships set ablaze to use as fuel for ambition that leave many eager to see Gallardo out of power. ,Throughout, , occasionally makes overtures at the grander significance of the story it’s telling. Across 10 episodes, Gallardo’s desperate maneuvers to retain control of his business and stick it to those who have slighted him have consequences that reverberate beyond the criminal underworld, ultimately resulting in a rigged presidential election. “Sound familiar?” the show’s narrator winks. ,There is a long series of assumptions in this, ideas that have been present in , from the start, even as it occasionally paid lip service to their subversion: that Central and South American nations are lawless playgrounds for the corrupt, where prosperity can only be seized by crooks and violence reigns. Every now and then , does its diligence to complicate this picture, almost entirely via narration: a tossed off line that notes the Mexican and Colombian drug trades exist wholly to serve the appetites of the wealthy in the US and Europe, or another about the fundamentally destabilizing influence of the United States’ foreign policy that created problems in exchange for the glow up of “solving” them. ,The actual moral universe of the show is far simpler: dope dealers deserve whatever’s coming to them, the bad guys often win, and the good guys should be able to do whatever it takes to stop them. , can’t truly complicate itself any further because doing so would acknowledge that all these stories are the same story, and in telling them, the show becomes complicit. Midway through the first season of ,, Gallardo (Diego Luna) leaves his native country for a secret meeting in South America. In a moment that’s designed to be a big surprise for longtime , fans, Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) is waiting for him. ,“I’ve always sort of seen this as of the Marvel superhero universe of connecting narcotraffickers, and that they all coexist,” showrunner Eric Newman , not long after the season premiered in 2018. It’s a crass way of describing the dynamics at play in these stories of cartels and corruption, but also a very American one. The gringos, as the Mexicans doing the dirty work for the cartel bosses say, always want more. And what better expression of “more” is there than the excesses of the modern cinematic universe? ,This is how , has carried on, and how it will carry on if it continues its run. Just as , harkened back to , with a well-deployed Escobar cameo depicting a meeting that likely never happened in the real world, the show continues to hint at the ways it will sprawl outward and continue telling these kinds of stories now that it has exhausted the drama of Gallardo’s Federation. It’s not subtle about it either, making sure in its first season that you know Gallardo’s driver Joaquín Guzmán goes by “Chapo” and spending a considerable amount of time this season laying the groundwork for rivalries that he will carry into the future, for what will be one of the most prolonged conflicts in the history of Mexico’s drug war. ,You could tell this story indefinitely, because it is still being told today, with every story of a white person enraged at the sound of Spanish being spoken, with every ICE raid, with every chant for the wall. Cartel dramas like , are fairy tales for a nation in decline, flattening diverse and complicated countries for the benefit of a nation that refuses to acknowledge the havoc it has wreaked on the world.

Which FX shows should you stream on Hulu?,"

And aside from some uncomfortable corporate consolidation undertones, it’s a boon to everyone who is ,. ,Think of FX like a basic cable HBO — a network that consistently churns out damn good television. It’s hard to go wrong with a lineup so consistently good, but here are a few favorites. ,follows Sam Fox, a middle-aged actress and single mother to three kids. The list of reasons to appreciate the show is long: it’s one of the warmest you can watch, full of love and empathy for nearly every person on-screen. It’s very funny, with cold opens that often leave you laughing within 30 seconds. And it’s completely beholden to its own interests, with each episode being an entirely different, lovely experience. Currently in the middle of its fourth season, , is a fantastic showcase for co-creator and star Pamela Adlon, who faced the unenviable task of contending with co-creator Louis C.K.’s admission of sexual misconduct between the show’s second and third seasons. Somehow, Adlon didn’t just weather the storm but she made a good thing even better. ,This is just... the coolest show. Distilled cool. One-hundred-proof slick. The story of Raylan Givens (devilishly handsome Timothy Olyphant), a US Marshal reassigned to his Kentucky hometown after his Wild West attitude gets him in hot water, , starts simply enough. Each episode features Givens on a new case, giving it a nice episodic feel while ongoing conflicts simmer in the background, eventually building to long-game payoffs. It’s a tremendously good binge, stylish from beginning to end. , has a quick hook: Earn Marks (Donald Glover) wants to prove to the mother of his daughter that he’s worth something, so he convinces his cousin, up-and-coming rapper Al “Paper Boi” Marks (Brian Tyree Henry) to let him be his manager. The show almost immediately abandons this premise in favor of surreal standalone episodes with only the smallest hints of continuity between them. In ,, creator Donald Glover and his collaborators have crafted a vehicle where anything can happen, and they can do whatever they want, from “Teddy Perkins,” an astonishing and unsettling episode about a Michael Jackson analog to an episode about a party Drake throws where Drake never appears. Satirical, sharp, and provocative, it’s impossible to know where , is going, but it’s always worth the ride. ,Let’s get this out of the way: the earliest seasons of , don’t play so well in 2020, 14 seasons (and counting) removed from the pilot. , has always been about the limits of good taste, and as times change, jokes simply hit you differently. But they’re also instructive: , is never a lazy show, continually evolving the situations it throws its cast of awful barflies in, always possessing a clear sense of who the real villains are: the privileged, moronic white bigots at the center of the show. It’s perhaps the finest show about a collection of jerks since , and easily the most inventive.,An eight-part drama about the push and pull between two of the most dynamic influences on the stage and the screen, , explores the tumultuous relationship between Bob Fosse (Sam Rockwell) and Gwen Verdon (Michelle Williams). As a choreographer and director, the former was known for changing Broadway forever behind the scenes, and as a dancer and actor, the latter was the face of that change. The reality of their dynamic was more complicated and involved than that, and while , is a bit shy when it comes to showing the fruits of their relationship — dancing, mostly— the series is a soulful, compelling look at two titans of show business struggling to hold their lives together when they weren’t putting on a show. ,One of the greatest missed opportunities in television, ,is a dramedy about two pals, Hank Dolworth and Britt Pollack, who work together as unlicensed private detectives in a San Diego beach town. As familiar as that may sound — the detective genre is one of TV’s most enduring — it’s never really been done like ,Almost lackadaisical in a manner that recalls ,, but also melancholy with a rich sense of place and character, ,is easy to love, a show that deserved a revival but also ended perfectly after its only 13-episode season. ,You probably know all about ,There have been blogs about it since blogs were invented. This is the , Best Show Ever Made, the story about a thoroughly corrupt anti-gang unit in the LAPD and their ongoing attempts to stay ahead of the consequences of their actions. That relentless focus on consequence makes , one of the most breathtaking TV shows you can watch, as stunning decisions made in the pilot reverberate to the very final episode, seven seasons later. The show attracted actors that were both already famous and a few years out from blowing up: Forest Whitaker, Glenn Close, Anthony Anderson, and Michael Peña all show up for varying lengths of time, each contributing to the tension in a different way. Uncompromising and raw, , ended too late to be adored as a nostalgic classic but also too early to benefit from a streaming glow-up like ,.

Together, they make a barely functional, astonishingly misanthropic pair that should be forbidden by law. But through sharp, clever writing and a willingness to break your damn heart, , manages to use the toxic couple at the heart of its story to make a surprisingly earnest exploration of love and relationships. While the middle seasons stumble, veering a little too far in the direction of unpleasantness, the show lands on its feet to be one of the most memorable and unlikely romantic comedies on television."

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"Every year ahead of the Oscars, all of the animated and live action shorts get bundled together and screened in theaters so people have a chance to check them out. I always go see the animated ones, and they’re always a lovely, strange, beautiful, and very mixed bag.,This year’s had some obvious standouts: ,, which won, really deserves to be a feature; and ,, by Pixar, was heartbreaking and had the best animated cat I’ve ever seen. The other three had some lovely animation — , was my least favorite of the package, and even that one I admired for the way it brought a natural, shaky camera movement to stop-motion animation, which is something I’ve never seen before.,The company that packs all the shorts together always pads out the running time with a few other short films from the year that didn’t snag a nomination. Usually, they’re appreciably worse. But this year, one of the bonus films was among my favorites and deserved to be a contender. It’s called ,, and it’s just six minutes of wonderfully goofy and perfectly done slapstick comedy. I understand why it wasn’t nominated. It’s not “serious,” but that’s exactly why it’s so refreshing.,Check out 10 trailers from this week below.,This is pure Wes Anderson, and there’s not much more to say. The film is about a fictional ,-esque magazine, and it also depicts several of the (also fictional) stories being published in the magazine’s final issue. The trailer is impossible to follow because of how many stories seem to be going on, but really, who cares? It looks great. The film comes out July 24th.,Here’s the thing: after this trailer came out, I read the , for the story of the Green Knight, and it’s just bonkers. None of it makes any sense. But it kind of seems like this movie is playing into that?

It looks like we’re headed to Russia this season.,This isn’t even a trailer, it’s a “camera test,” which is kind of a ridiculously early release to include in a trailer roundup. But it’s for a big title, so here it is: a first look at Robert Pattinson as Batman. The movie is currently scheduled to come out in June 2021.,This trailer is ostensibly for a movie starring Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it’s absolutely bizarre to watch. The reason why: the distributor is trying its best to hide the fact that this is not really a movie starring Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but a 2019 sequel to a Russian/Chinese film that happens to have the two action stars in small roles. It looks... not great, but I guess that explains why.,The premise is more than a little twee, but it’s worth keeping an eye on ,. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is an executive producer and has a recurring role on the series, which seems like as good a reason as any to check in. The show debuts April 12th.,The main thing you need to know about , is that the Charles Dickens’ adaptation is directed and co-written by Armando Iannucci, the creator of ,, and it looks just as ludicrous as you’d expect.

How The Mandalorian teamed up with Fortnite creator Epic Games to create its digital sets,"
          Feb 20, 2020,  2:19pm EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"One of the most impressive parts of , (other than ,) was the production design, with the varied locations, sets, and effects despite the comparatively lower budget for television as opposed to a blockbuster film. ,As it turns out, that’s because most of it wasn’t real. Rather, more than half of the season was shot using Industrial Light & Magic’s new StageCraft technology, which uses giant 20-foot-tall LED video screens to create fully digital environments as in-camera sets and backdrops, ,. ,Those environments are purely digital creations, which ILM ,, and then projected around the actors and physical set elements (like spaceship parts or speeder bikes) to create the finished project. As part of that effect, those LED screens are actually then shot on camera for a seamless effect that replicates location shooting without the costs. (The 3D environments are specifically lit and rendered from the perspective of the camera to accomplish that.),There are also real benefits to the virtual sets compared to a traditional green screen setup. Since the actors are actually on the set with the displays, they can see and react to things in the background while they’re actually shooting, instead of imagining effects that will be added later.,It also means that the lightning from those digital sets is present on set and interacting with the physical elements, like the actors and props. So shots where Mando and Baby Yoda sit around a fire, with the sunset shining off Mando’s armor still look right because that light is actually there on set. It’s just coming from an LED screen instead of an actual sun. ,Additionally, because the “sets” are just digitally projected 3D environments, they can be moved around and edited on the fly. Don’t like where a mountain is in the background for a particular shot? Simply move it around, or just delete it entirely. ,ILM had already been using effects like this on existing films, ,, where the “windows” of the Millennium Falcon were digital screens, allowing for the lighting effect of the hyperspace jumps to be projected on the actors’ faces in camera. But , took the technology to a much bigger scale, with a 270-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling that created a 75-foot-wide set.,Again, check out ILM’s video to get the full look at StageCraft. But best of all, ,’s first season is just the start for this new tech. The company announced today that it’ll be making StageCraft available for use by filmmakers and showrunners worldwide as an end-to-end solution, meaning that the digital set technology could be showing up in a lot more TV shows and movies in the future."
Dish Network floats merger with DirecTV over pace of cord-cutting,"
          Feb 19, 2020,  3:46pm EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"The two biggest satellite TV providers — Dish Network and DirecTV — may be looking to merge, according to Dish chairman Charlie Ergen, who called a potential merger with its biggest satellite rival “inevitable” on the company’s Q4 earnings call, according to ,. ,The news comes as Dish reports that in Q4 2019 it lost 100,000 satellite TV subscribers, along with roughly 94,000 Sling TV subscribers — the first time Sling TV’s subscribers have ever gone down. The drop in satellite customers isn’t nearly as bad as Dish reported a year ago, when it lost 386,000 subscribers, but it’s certainly not a good trend to see. All told, Dish lost a net total of 511,000 subscribers in 2019, compared to a loss of about 1.13 million in 2018. ,It’s that ongoing downward trend that led Ergen to comment that Dish and DirecTV “should get together,” noting that “the growth in TV is not coming from linear TV providers, but from huge programmers.” It’s not entirely clear what a merger would look like, given that DirecTV is currently owned by AT&T, but a sale of the satellite portion of AT&T’s TV business to Dish seems like a distinct possibility, especially given AT&T’s focus on new ,. ,Ergen went on to note that there would likely be regulatory issues to work out — after all, Dish and DirecTV already make up a considerable portion of the satellite market, and had already been barred from merging back in 2002 over concerns of eliminating competition. But the increased pressure from nontraditional internet TV services and streaming is taking a toll. “You just can’t swim upstream against a real tide of big players,” Ergen said. "

        ",Jay Peters,"A new deepfake puts Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pilot episode of the original ,, “The Cage” — and I kind of love it. In this particular AI-powered face swap, Bezos plays a Talosian alien with a huge bald head, while Musk plays Captain Christopher Pike (who is the captain of the USS Enterprise before James T. Kirk). 	,Here’s a very short version of what’s going on in this scene, if you’re wondering: in this episode, the Talosian aliens capture Pike to enslave him and use him to breed humans that will be used to rebuild a destroyed society. Pike tries to escape throughout the episode, and eventually, the Talosians decide that humans’ resistance to captivity won’t make them a good fit for that plan.,The conversation is kind of hard to follow, and that’s probably because the clips from the episode are stitched together to make it seem like it’s only the Talosian alien and Captain Pike having a conversation. In the actual episode, there are a number of other characters who are critical to the conversation that this deepfake doesn’t show. ,But even though the scene is confusing, I think the deepfake is scarily impressive, particularly the unsettling-looking Bezos as a Talosian alien.

Netflix’s Gentefied follows a Mexican American family in the heart of a gentrifying LA neighborhood,"
          Feb 21, 2020,  2:07pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"In ,, everyone knows the score. That’s the dark joke about being a young person of color in the US, where access to information is more equitable than the power to use that information. It’s easy to know exactly how you’re being shut out of opportunity and hard to do anything about it. For the Mexican family at the heart of ,, the game is clearly rigged, and winning it might cost more than it’s worth.,Netflix’s new half-hour dramedy from producer America Ferrera and writer / creator duo Linda Yvette Chavez and Marvin Lemus follows a trio of cousins who struggle to keep their grandpa’s taco shop afloat in Los Angeles’ Boyle Heights neighborhood. This is harder than it’s ever been: gentrification is sweeping through the neighborhood, slowly forcing the Chicano population out of town at a time when money isn’t easy to come by. ,Each cousin has their own dream in addition to the family one: Ana wants to be an artist and struggles to scrounge together expensive supplies and find a showcase for her work. Erik is torn between being responsible for running the shop and his desire to have a family of his own. Chris, just back from college, wants to be a chef in Paris, though it means stifling his Mexican heritage. ,In following the three of them and those in their orbit, , is both a celebration of a modern Mexican American family and also the story about their struggle against the ever-present threat of erasure. At every juncture, there’s something that wants them to forget who they are. In his studies to be a chef, Chris has developed an affinity for the upper-class, culturally sterile world of fine dining. Ana’s desire to find a platform for her art puts her at odds with her activist friends. Erik’s pride and machismo jeopardize the profitability of the shop and his relationship with Lydia, his estranged, pregnant ex who he wants to prove he’s good enough for. ,Lined up above them all are the invisible guillotines that dangle over many people of color in America. The ever-present call of the landlord; the racism of employers that must go unanswered, lest you lose your job; and the ambient threat of ICE officers who do not particularly care if you are a citizen. ,The show does seem to sometimes rely on a checklist, the kind that comes into play whenever there is a story about the slow infringement of wealthy white people on communities of color. A lot of the same tropes are present, whether it’s a show like , or ,or , before it. There are millennials who want all the same Instagram-friendly food and decor for taco Tuesday, landlords who would rather rent to said millennials at top dollar than the already-high rates they charge their current tenants of color, and the upper-middle-class institutions that only really want people of color if they clean up their act. (Read: be more white.),Because of this, ,is at its best when it gets specific: a midseason episode that follows a mariachi singer who frequents the taco shop, another that chronicles the lifelong friendship and romance between Ana and her girlfriend Yessika, or Chris’ ongoing struggles to prove to his fellow line cooks that he is “Mexican enough” and not a “coconut” (a term implying that he’s brown on the outside, white on the inside). ,Stories about the children of immigrants often revolve around the fundamental tension of being caught between the culture of their parents’ homeland and that of the home where they were raised. These kinds of stories are as old as immigration itself. In ,, there’s the modern wrinkle of “authenticity,” the monied interest in a culture sanitized for white consumption and social media clout without any concern for place, for people, for history. It is a constant pressure, easy to give in to and fun to participate in. ,It’s also impermanent. Soon, there will be something else. The tastemakers will move to another neighborhood, and no one will care for the accommodations once made for them. This is the existential threat facing the children of immigrants now. Fighting it seems impossible, an extra set of obstacles in addition to the regular set of hurdles you have to clear in order to achieve the better life your parents want for you. Give in, and all that will be left is the exorbitant rent in a gutted neighborhood your family left long ago, leaving fragments of a culture you are already starting to forget. "

While looking up where to stream it, Google presented me with its “top voted tags” for the movie (I have no idea how these are generated), which were: slow, boring, pretentious, overrated, confusing, strong acting, and “+3 more.” ,, I thought.,One fascinating technique the film repeatedly uses is to obfuscate the beginnings of things and drop us into events well past when they’ve begun. The entire beginning of the central romantic relationship is left offscreen, as is all but the ending of a very significant argument between the couple. It’s disorienting and strange, but it helps to convey the feelings of the protagonist — suddenly in over her head, not entirely sure of how things got this way.,There’s apparently a sequel in the works.

"Hunters review: good at killing Nazis, and very bad at most other things","
          Feb 19, 2020,  8:43am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera," has a premise that feels like a double entendre. Amazon’s Jordan Peele-produced drama about Nazi hunters in the 1970s feels made with this specific moment when white nationalist sentiment gets parroted by government officials and in the national news. Characters are constantly saying things in a way that winkingly acknowledges the camera: ,The delivery always sounds like a dick joke, but the dick is Nazis. ,The slow-burn premiere introduces Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman), a Jewish teenager who lives in Brooklyn with his grandmother. When said grandmother is murdered in their home, Jonah discovers something she hid from the world: she was a member of a secret fraternity of Nazi-hunting vigilantes, exacting revenge on those conspiring to bring about a Fourth Reich. ,Headed by the wealthy Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino), the Hunters (if they sound like a superhero team, that’s intentional) methodically vet and seek out their victims and dole out painful justice on them, making sure they know exactly what crimes they are asking for. Interspersed throughout are interludes and flashbacks to concentration camps and the atrocities committed therein, lest the viewer start to feel that the Hunters are being a little , cruel. ,There are also strange diversions into dance, Guy Ritchie-style title cards but with a Yiddish exploitation twist, and fourth wall-breaking sketches. The villains monologue and salute a long-deceased Hitler with tears in their eyes. , is in the business of hurricane-force whiplash.,The only real anchors in all of this are the show’s two leads, Jonah and Offerman, and unfortunately, only one of them works. Despite being the de facto protagonist, Jonah doesn’t offer much to latch on to as a character. We get brief glimpses of his personal life — his friends, his crush, the anti-Semitic bully who tries to cheat Jonah out of the drugs he has to sell in order to help his grandmother pay the rent — but it’s all in the service of the plot. If we meet a person in his life, it’s because they’re going to ferry him to wherever he needs to be for the next scene to happen. ,This makes all of his big moments feel like they occur in a vacuum — especially when he’s paired up with the other Hunters, all of whom have a disappointingly small amount of screentime. Pacino is great. Everyone else makes you wonder what their deal is. (Also, Josh Radnor is on this show... why?),The five episodes that were made available in advance to critics leave things at a critical juncture halfway through the 10-episode season. Some of ,’ biggest thematic questions revolve around whether ends justify means or if the pursuit of vengeance risks corrupting those who seek it. These are familiar questions, perhaps even tired ones, but it’s possible that , comes up with an interesting answer. ,This is the upshot of a show as tonally uneven as ,: there’s no telling how it’s going to end. It’s hard to be optimistic. While the show does a lot of different things, one thing it doesn’t do is spend its time well. The first episode is nearly an hour and a half long; each of the four that follow clock in at about an hour. An inordinate amount of that time is spent mulling over a missed opportunity, longing for moments with the barely expressed rage of Pacino’s Offerman, or following any of the other Hunters instead of Jonah. It’s telling that, for all its stylistic quirks, the show is at its best when it’s playing it straight: the fourth episode, which tells twin stories of a bank heist and a couple’s desperate escape from a concentration camp, is among the best of the bunch and is delivered in a simple fashion. ,Like the eponymous team it follows, ,has a list of goals, and some of those goals are in conflict with one another. It wants to be a harrowing remembrance of the suffering of the Holocaust, a satisfying revenge fantasy, a sensational period piece, and a dark comedy. These can all be achieved together with skill, but only if the tension between them is acknowledged and addressed. Instead, the show shifts from tone to tone, more temperamental than genre-bending thrill ride.,It’s frustrating because even the ridiculous, preening Nazis of , share a trait that real-life fascists have: they know what they want. A show about the people who fight them should, too."

Better Call Saul knows how much we love a good scam,"
          Feb 25, 2020,  3:09pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera," was always going to be a show about a man dying in slow motion. At the start of the series, Saul Goodman — best known as Walter White’s huckster lawyer in , — goes by another name, the one given to him at birth. Jimmy McGill is a different, more earnest person than Saul Goodman, someone who does not exist in ,. Unlike Walter White, we know exactly what’s going to happen to Jimmy, and ,is a better show for it. ,In the show’s fifth season, Jimmy’s transformation into Saul is nearly complete. McGill is getting his feet under him after the death of his brother and the end of a yearlong suspension from practicing law. Now, he’s back in the saddle and trying to build his practice as fast as possible under his Saul Goodman alias, which he used for much of the last season to build connections with petty criminals he sold burner phones to for fast cash. ,It’s all so very sad, even if Bob Odenkirk’s carnival barker performance as Jimmy / Saul is as entertaining and funny as it’s always been. As a man who lost his brother, Jimmy never gives himself the opportunity to mourn, instead throwing himself back into the world of two-bit hustles that he knows best, working over suckers and building his reputation in the untapped market of low-level criminals in the habit of committing misdemeanors. Bit by bit, Jimmy McGill is being buried alive, and Saul Goodman is holding the shovel. ,Like the show from which it spun off, ,’s dramatic arc is an inevitable one. We know that things aren’t going to end well from the start — to a degree that , might sound repetitive to people who have seen ,. On a superficial level, this is true: both are shows about a man going sour. But the hows and whys of ,’s downward slide feel more vital and relevant, perhaps because they are more tragic. ,If ,showed us what entitled toxic masculinity looked like when it ran rampant in the life of the most milquetoast protagonist imaginable, , is about a slower, sadder thing: a man who learns that having feelings is for suckers. It’s a show for the irony-poisoned and extremely online where nothing is assumed to be genuine, and everything is probably a scam. , is concerned with what happens when people decide that scamming is the only way to win, and the immense harm inflicted by people who have convinced themselves that anyone behaving earnestly is just playing the game wrong. In ,, this is illustrated by Kim Wexler, Jimmy’s longtime friend and girlfriend / partner, a damn good lawyer in her own right with a bit of a grifter’s streak in her. ,Kim, however, is a character of integrity with a sense of justice and lines that she only crosses when that notion of justice is violated. She’s a vigilante scammer where McGill is an equal-opportunity swindler. At the end of the day, she believes in the system and in Jimmy’s capacity to be an honest man. This means, in ,’s universe, she’s doomed. ,In this penultimate season — the show will only return for one more — Kim is learning a truth that Jimmy’s in denial of: no matter how much you tell someone that they are capable of being honest or good, once they have decided that truth does not pay, it’s only a matter of time before they stop maintaining the charade altogether.

"In I Am Not Okay With This, being a teen girl does not get easier with superpowers","

        ",Joshua Rivera," begins with Sydney Novak, covered in blood, running down the middle of the street at night. There are probably other ways she’d rather be spending her time. That would seem to make sense with the series’s narrative: her life is pretty normal — up until the part where you find out she has superpowers that allow her to blow things up with her mind. ,Netflix’s new comedy is a work of low-key dread that recalls a lot of other stories about young women coming of age. It has ,’s supernatural angst, ,’s oddball quirk, and the smart-twee edge of ,. Syd is a gross weirdo — she’s equally fascinated and frustrated by her leg acne, pretty fine with being ostracized by her classmates, and perplexed by the people she is attracted to. The difference here is that Syd is also very, very angry.,Sydney’s powers are a manifestation of her rage, and she has plenty to be mad about. Her best friend has fallen for a crude jock, her single mom is overworked and demanding, and, as the show slowly reveals, there’s a deep family trauma that has haunted her since before the series began. ,But even with this in mind, , spends most of its time being more charming than angry. Much of it focuses on Syd’s budding relationship with fellow weirdo Stanley Barber. Stanley is played by Wyatt Oleff — best known as one of the kids in , — who reads here as Timothee Chalamet, but a little bit wrong. This plays incredibly well opposite Sophia Lillis’ Syd, another , star and a tremendously talented young actor. ,Lillis juggles all of Sydney’s wildly conflicting emotions with ease, able to simultaneously portray the anxieties expressed in the running narration from Syd’s diary that’s read throughout the show and the quirky facade she presents to the world. With only seven short episodes, there’s not a whole lot of plot to burn through, but Lillis’ performance never lets you forget the multitude of emotions burning beneath Syd’s disaffected exterior. , doesn’t really end as much as it stops in its tracks. The season finishes with an abrupt conclusion that is clearly meant to set up a second season, but it also brings little in the way of resolution — something that feels a bit unfair given how lean and sharp the show is, each episode taking only just the time it needs to make its point and leave. (Usually, this doesn’t take much more than 20 minutes.),It doesn’t help that its cliffhanger ending tugs at the one plot thread that would make the show stand out beyond its new-school take on ,. Since its first image immediately conjures ,’s climax, the comparison is unavoidable and will immediately cause you to guess where,is going. (You probably won’t be that far off from the truth.) There’s more to this story, and readers of the Charles Forsman graphic novel it’s based on might be frustrated at some of its most fascinating and darkest plot beats are being reserved for another set of episodes. ,Despite this, ,works really well because of all the things it conveys without speaking a word, all of them difficult: being a young woman who doesn’t adhere to a narrow definition of femininity, who is figuring out her sexuality, who is handling grief, disillusionment, poverty, , superpowers. Why, the show quietly asks, is there no one there to catch Sydney if she falls apart?"

It was great! , made me worried that the film would be too stylized and stark, but I was actually really impressed at how it balanced those elements were while still telling the straight story.,The film uses a lot of the stylized humor to set up its characters and world, then slowly fades it out as the drama ratchets up. Emma’s father is constantly ridiculous, a key love interest is dressed down before he’s built back up, and a secondary character is annoying to exaggerated lengths, nicely setting up how she later impacts the plot.,Finding that balance between stylized humor and natural storytelling always seems challenging, and I love how much it happens in setups and payoffs here.

"McMillions review: finally, the burger-related true crime series we’ve been waiting for","
          Mar  2, 2020,  2:45pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"It’s a good idea to have a few questions in mind whenever you order a burger. Nothing too wild. Simple stuff, like: Does this burger have cheese? (It should.) Other toppings? (Knock yourself out.) How about fries on the side? (Anything worth doing is worth doing right.) And then the most important question: Is this burger involved in a massive, years-long fraud scheme? Because, as HBO’s , would like to remind us, if you got a McDonald’s burger in the ’90s in the hopes of winning the chain’s annual Monopoly game, there was a huge criminal conspiracy devoted to robbing you of your chance to strike it rich. ,The documentary miniseries — which has aired four of six episodes — brings viewers back to the heyday of McDonald’s most successful promotion, which encouraged customers nationwide to buy fast food in order to score more Monopoly-themed game pieces. Prizes for collecting these pieces ranged from inconsequential (free fries) to massive ($1 million). And for twelve years, the game was completely rigged by a slowly expanding group of criminals who figured out how to crack the system. , devotes its hour-long episodes into slowly unspooling how this crime unfolded over its decade-plus reign, starting from the FBI agents who first started to pursue a tip they nearly dismissed outright, to the associates of the suspects they identify as the case gains traction. It’s a great story in and of itself, one ,in the summer of 2018. For the first few minutes of , however, you wonder if it’s being oversold — there’s some truly cheesy re-enactments, and the show’s initial focus makes it feel terribly narrow, like there isn’t much to hold your attention for five more hours of this. ,But there is much more, and the reasons to keep watching start piling up fast. First, there’s Agent Doug Matthews, the most prominent source early on. A junior agent in the FBI at the time the investigation into the Monopoly fraud scheme began, Matthews is such a good TV character it’s hard to believe he is, in fact, a real person. Loquacious and vain, Matthews talks with a soft drawl and heavy bravado, happy to recount his early days helping to construct an elaborate and reckless sting to draw out the fraudsters. He’s almost , eager, to the point where it starts to feel strange to essentially start rooting for the feds at a point where it’s not clear what the ,crime is. Then the bigger picture starts to come into focus, and the cast of characters expands. , quickly becomes a whirlwind tour of an unlikely underworld, full of wannabe gangsters, Southern real estate impresarios, and friendly drug dealers who look like Jerry from ,. Like a lot of the most satisfying mysteries, the who of this story is apparent early on, and the hows and whys are what keeps you watching.,Mostly, it’s extremely satisfying to get lost in a true crime tale that doesn’t revolve around a grisly murder or the grifting of everyday people — the biggest victims here are almost always McDonald’s, and the people who get too greedy as the Monopoly fraud scheme grows. ,The biggest note of discomfort in , doesn’t necessarily relate to the fraud scheme at hand, but the idea of McDonald’s. Early on in the show, the corporation is described as being eager to cooperate with the FBI because of its brand image, a talking head noting that if McDonald’s cannot be trusted thanks to some fraudsters, it would cause irreparable damage to the brand. It’s an aside that kept coming to mind as footage lifted from news reports over the last decade or so played throughout the miniseries, video that showed all manner of everyday people flocking to their local franchise to eat. ,It’s striking how ordinary they are in comparison to the louder cast of characters that , follows. They’re an unassuming bunch of people, presumably doing what they need to do to get through an already-too-stressful day. They remind me of the times I ate McDonald’s as a kid, one of too many mouths to feed on not enough money, and then again as an adult, stretched thin and aware that it was sold to me by people paid too little, stretched as thin as I was, for the benefit of suits who, frankly, did not care. It would be a shame if anything happened to that brand image, though. "

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,", and so are the first official numbers for Netflix’s latest streaming hit ,. The company says the series was watched by 76 million households, making it the most-watched first season of television ever for Netflix. That’s according to Netflix’s newly unveiled definition of “watched,” which it changed from “watched 70 percent of a single episode of a series” to anyone who “chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes.” ,In explaining the new metric, Netflix notes that the two-minute time period is meant to be “long enough to indicate the choice was intentional,” and it says that it follows similar metrics used by BBC’s iPlayer, YouTube, and ,’ measurements of page views. But the reasoning behind the change is obvious: to juice viewer numbers, with Netflix acknowledging that the new two-minute metric is “about 35% higher on average than the prior metric.” ,To put that number in perspective, two minutes of , is less time than it takes to reach the opening credits of the first episode; the action-packed cold opening is coincidentally two minutes and 16 seconds long. By Netflix’s new metric, anyone who watched just the opening scene of the episode (or 3.2 percent of the total runtime of the episode, which is itself one of eight episodes) is now counted as a view for the entire season.

It comes out February 21st.,Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots star in this strange sci-fi movie about a couple who become trapped in a neighborhood of identical homes and are forced to raise some kind of freaky clone baby. It seems fun, and I’m assuming there’ll be some cutting criticism of suburbia in here. There doesn’t appear to be a release date just yet. (As a side note: At one point, this trailer flashes a huge Rotten Tomatoes logo advertising an 89 percent rating, and while that’s a great score, I still find loudly advertising a B+ to be kind of hilarious. The rating is now at 87 percent.)"

        ",Sean Hollister,"If you were hoping to watch the Super Bowl on your Roku TV or set-top box, I hope you weren’t counting on streaming it through Fox’s apps — Roku is pulling all its Fox apps off of the platform, effective Friday, two days before the Big Game.,That might strike you as sudden, considering , that Fox Sports was working hard to bring a 4K HDR stream of the Super Bowl to Roku’s streaming sticks, pucks, and TVs. But minutes ago, Fox Sports removed references to Roku from multiple spots on its Super Bowl website, and we’ve now confirmed with Roku that seven channels in total are leaving... unless Fox and Roku strike a deal.,You see, this isn’t an arbitrary move, or even a technical issue — it’s a carriage dispute between the two companies, Roku tells ,Roku and Fox have a distribution agreement set to expire tomorrow. “We offered Fox an extension... if an agreement is not reached, we’ll be forced to remove the channels,” a company representative says. ,Here’s Fox’s statement, which clearly shows how heated this situation is:,Roku told us that it would be “forced to remove the channels” if an agreement is not reached, but Fox says that’s false; it’s entirely Roku’s decision. Roku declined to answer whether there’s actual contractual language that forces them to remove the channels.,Either way, these are the seven Fox channels that are disappearing, according to Roku:,Note that even if you still have these Fox apps on your Roku, the company says they won’t work anymore starting Friday. ,But there are other ways to stream. “The game will stream free on the NFL app on Roku unless Fox blocks your ability to stream it,” reads ,.

Alternatively, you can sign up for FuboTV, YouTube TV, Sling TV, or Hulu with Live TV, a number of which have free trials if you haven’t previously been a subscriber. A rep says FuboTV may even offer a 4K stream.,But there’s a very good chance you can’t count on Fox’s own Roku apps to bring you the Super Bowl on Sunday, since Fox and Roku are playing hardball.,That may be a surprise to some Roku owners, since this is all that Roku is currently telling them via email — no mention of the game:,We’ll have to wait and see.

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"I finally got to see , the other week since I am, temporarily at least, a Hulu subscriber again, and that’s where it’s currently streaming. It’s a great movie with a tough political viewpoint that feels all its own, at least among (arguably) mainstream films. It’s all the more impressive considering that it’s the debut feature from Boots Riley.,One thing I particularly appreciated was, after the fact, getting to read some of Riley’s writing offering insight into how he saw his characters and why his movie was crafted the way it was. So often, stories are left out there like singular, pristinely drawn objects that could only ever have existed one way. In a (since deleted) , , ,, Riley spoke to other ways the screenplay could have been crafted and why he landed on certain characterizations and events.,If you’ve seen the film already, it’s worth a read. His note offers a great look into some of his thinking behind the movie, and it’s one of the most useful responses to viewer criticism that I’ve ever seen — not rejecting something and moving on, but explaining out his point of view and acknowledging the challenges he faced pointing things in different directions.,Check out seven trailers from this week below.,There’s no series , staffers are more passionate about than ,, and the next entry looks like yet another two-or-so hours of truly ridiculous nonstop action with occasional pauses for platitudes about family. Aka, it seems perfect. The film comes out May 22nd. And yes, apparently , is the full name for this one.,This movie looks gorgeously shot, intensely moody, and extremely uncomfortable. , is a thriller about a pregnant woman who begins to harm herself through means suggested by the film’s title. The trailer has me extremely unsure of how this all plays out (the film seems to be extremely cold and cruel to its main character), but I’ve seen multiple reviews referring to it as a “feminist thriller,” so perhaps the trailer is just misleading. The film comes out March 6th.,The showrunner of HBO’s , teams up with Nicole Kidman again for a new short series about a woman who starts to fall apart after a killing. Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland make appearances, too. The series starts in May.,Forest Whitaker stars as a reverend who befriends a white supremacist in 1996 South Carolina in this film, which is apparently based on real events.

The best anime of 2019,"
          Jan 31, 2020,  1:50pm EST
        ",D. M. Moore,"Hundreds of new anime series come out every year, so it can be difficult to pick out which ones are actually worth watching. With each new anime season, , tries to point fans to interesting new shows via , ,. But it can be hard to judge a series by its cover — or at least by the first few episodes. Some of the best shows each year don’t always make it into those previews. To highlight all of the shows that stood out after a complete watch, we’ve assembled this list of the best new anime of 2019. While it won’t be entirely comprehensive — it only includes series we’ve watched and finished — everything on the list is something we can unequivocally recommend.,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind,A few years back, I wrote a list of recent shows that would be , to anime. The recommendations in it were divided by genre to point people toward avenues they already liked. , has become the show I flatly recommend when asked for suggestions — a series so good it would get the same attention prestige dramas do, if only it were live-action. ,For the animation studio behind the series, WIT, it feels like their capstone work for the decade. It demonstrates everything they learned from making action shows like , and ,, to character dramas such as , and ,. , captures all of that experience and focuses it into a story full of memorable characters, amazingly animated action scenes, and great character drama in the midst of much bigger historical moments. If I had to pick a single best show of the decade, let alone the year, it would be hard not to choose ,.,In , science is a superpower, but it is never used as magic to handwave away something complicated. Instead it relishes in the details, and in the trial-and-error and hypothesizing. At its core, the show is actually about being a scientist: the importance of knowledge, of being inquisitive about the world, and of being ethical in what you use technology to do. It makes science fun by demonstrating how magical it can be, and then shows you how anybody can become a wizard.,is a charming show that forgoes the idea of wish fulfillment. Most shows that feature characters reincarnated in fantasy worlds give them amazing, unique powers. ,instead focuses on an adult librarian taking over the body of Myne, the sickly five-year-old daughter of a poor city guard. It becomes more about the everyday struggles of Myne and her family as she uses her knowledge from our world to try and make books, but also improve the lives of her family and friends without arousing suspicion that she isn’t the real Myne. It’s a show that is ideal for the whole family, or as a way to relax. Even in its most stressful moments, , just feels nice to watch.,It isn’t rare for the anime version of a manga to elevate the source material, as adaptations often rewrite characters or moments of the story with better foresight about later developments. And the addition of sound and animation can expand on and enhance moments in ways just not possible in the comic form. What’s rare about ,’s adaptation is the consistency with which the animation and voice acting enhances the work, not just for specific important scenes, but every episode.,The spectacular action scenes are most noticeable — they’re stylish and easy to follow, even when seemingly impossible things are occurring. In smaller, subtler moments, the animation and voice acting breathe life into the characters and make them more endearing. The best example of this is the way protagonist and titular demon slayer Tanjiro looks genuinely sad when killing a demon. He has genuine pity for them, even though they’re terrible, irredeemable monsters. He has to continue to humanize them, so he can justify continuing to travel with his now-demon sister, looking to cure her. Small characterizations like this speak volumes by making the spectacular climactic moments more emotionally meaningful.,The concept of , a girl starts living with two cousins who both turn into different animals from the Chinese zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex — makes it sound like a comedy romance series in the vein of ,. But , isn’t so lighthearted. It’s more of an emotional gut-punch, episode after episode, as it reveals the terrible things that have happened to each of the characters. They’re never quite what you expect them to be.,But the show isn’t all sadness. It’s an amazingly hopeful story about finding acceptance, finding a family, and working through issues — not with quick solutions, but through sustained care. It finds a great balance between drama, romance, and comedy, which makes those devastating moments land particularly hard., is stressful, hilarious, awkward, heartwarming, melodramatic, cringeworthy, and absolutely brilliant. The show follows the five girls of a high school literature club as they collectively start thinking about sex and adult relationships for the first time. They’re all individually attempting to figure out their feelings and sexuality, and their stories interconnect as they collectively support (and sometimes impede) each other., in some ways is similar to a show like ,, except without the focus on nostalgia and cringe humor. Instead, the show goes for drama with dashes of comedy. It ranges from more lighthearted, cute romantic fare to frank discussions and storylines about queer romance, teen pregnancy, and possibly inappropriate (and sometimes , inappropriate) relationships with adults. It’s a testament to the writing that it manages to deftly navigate tricky subject matter without being problematic or preachy., is a show about Karou, a young single office worker, and the strange lazy bear Rilakkuma who comes to live in her apartment. While Rilakkuma is something of a freeloader, he effectively earns his place in the apartment by teaching Kaoru how to relax from the stresses of her work and relative lack of social life, by finding enjoyment in everyday things. That makes it an incredibly relaxing show. And the amazing stop-motion animation work adds a charming tactility. ,, which makes it marvelously smooth and lively.,The second season of , feels as though there wasn’t a three-year break after the first season. The show continues to be an amazing animation showcase, and watching it often feels like the animators at Bones, the studio that animated both seasons, are showing off and having ,. But what makes both seasons great is the sense of humor and heart on display.,This new season goes to some darker places than the first season. It’s less focused on testing the incredible psychic powers of middle-schooler Mob and more focused on testing his empathy and maturity as he grows up and becomes a person rather than an ultra-powerful psychic force of nature. Even with the darker tone and themes, a wonderful sense of absurdity and humor still grounds the whole series and keeps it from losing its relatability.,Some anime series start off with such strange conceits that they either completely put the audience off or become utterly captivating to understand. , is that sort of show. It follows three middle school boys who get turned into mythical creatures called kappas. They’ll only become human again if they steal a fictional desire-organ from inside the butt of a spirit monster that’s magically stealing items from the city to serve an evil empire of otters.,The real crux of the show, which is hidden beneath all the strange kappa and otter mythological imagery, is personal and human. It’s about exploring the ways we connect with those around us and what those connections mean. It’s a great follow-up for fans who watched , when it hit Netflix and are ,. But despite how weird it can get with all the kappa butt stuff, anyone could enjoy this show. It’ll likely be talked about for years to come, not just for the writing, but for the animation as well.,Early on, , feels like it’s writing a check it has no chance of being able to cash. It seems unlikely we’ll get any significant character development for the 10 different main characters, and their transition from not even amateur runners to one of the top college-marathon teams in Japan seems like it would be fantastical at worst and dubious at best.,Yet, over the course of its 23 episodes, the series presents a convincing story by being less about the sport than about these college students figuring out their lives in the present and future. The running acts as a constant that forces them all to interact, confronting issues in their lives while coming together as a group. This all climaxes in the show’s final episodes: as they run their section of a competitive two-day relay, they reflect on everything that’s happened. The ending only works because of how much the audience knows and cares about the characters, having seen so much of what they’ve gone through.,’s anime adaption is incredibly faithful, but it’s also a fascinating interpretation of the source material about the oldest kids at a secluded orphanage learning that they are actually being raised as food for demons. The manga is fundamentally more of a thriller, while the anime takes on a more horror-like quality. It’s not because they changed anything in the text of the work; it’s because of the way , Mamoru Kanbe visually approached it. Conversations as the kids secretly plan or try to work out what new information they have, are shot in an almost voyeuristic fashion, like the camera is spying on them from around a dark corner. The style adds to the creeping dread of these scenes in a way that isn’t found in the manga.,Even with all that, Emma, who is effectively the lead protagonist, is a breath of fresh air. She exudes a caring and optimism that serve as the driving force for keeping the characters moving forward, while affecting the way they think about approaching problems. She’s never presented as too naïve or not smart enough to understand her dire situation, though, which keeps the show from getting too dark or despairing to enjoy.,initially looks like it’s going to be a wish-fulfillment power fantasy. It’s about a middle-aged Tokyo man who dies while protecting his co-worker from being stabbed. But before completely dying, he awakens in a fantasy world as a low-level slime monster in a cave. Thanks to some strange abilities given to him as part of his transference to this fantasy world, he’s able to absorb items and creatures, allowing him to use and combine their abilities. After befriending a powerful dragon and receiving its blessing, he sets out to learn more about the new world he’s a part of.,The subsequent story could just be about him using his cool new powers in a fantasy world to get everything he ever wanted. Instead, the show is full of empathy. Rimuru is incredibly overpowered, but they understand that while they are possibly indestructible, others aren’t. So they end up using that power like a well-meaning middle manager, knowing how to delegate, and when and how to correctly protect and support others. This all adds a charm to the show, as the drama and story becomes less about Rimuru and more about those around them., has the intensity and mind games of ,, except it’s a bizarre rom-com about two people who like each other and are trying to get the other one to admit it first. Kaguya is vice president of the student council at a prestigious private school and heiress of a rich and powerful family. Student council president Miyuki is from a less auspicious family but is one of the most popular students at school. ,The concept is an interesting twist on a high school rom-com, but that alone isn’t enough to put it on this list. The show’s animation adds so much to the tension and emotional stakes of each scene, with incredibly stylized shots and exceptionally well-animated moments. These shots often elevate the absurdity of the dramatic confrontations, which are comedically great when you remember how trivially stupid the stakes are here, with both characters scheming to get the other person to ask them out. This isn’t a will they / won’t they show. It seems obvious that they’ll eventually come together. It’s just about watching the bizarre antics as these two would-be lovers stumble over their pride.,From the previews, , gives every indication that it’s going to be a cute show about a guy who adopts a cat. Instead, it’s a humorous, heartfelt show about social anxiety, trauma, and depression. It doesn’t just explore this through the secluded author Subaru, who’s dealing with the sudden death of his parents; it explores the same things with Haru the cat, who has her own issues from trying to take care of her siblings when they were abandoned.,The series shows almost everything from both Subaru and Haru’s perspectives, which helps contextualize Haru’s reactions to what Sabaru sees her do. Mainly, it shows how the growing connection between the two helps them find a better balance in their lives where their issues aren’t a constant impediment. It’s not a flashy show with amazing animation, but it tells a poignant story about mental health with the right amount of humor.,Where to start in talking about , It’s such an odd combination of action, body horror, fashion, and meta-referential musician references. For fans who’ve watched the series since part 1, it might all seem pretty normal now. But coming into this latest series fresh could be jarring. Still, this season, the fifth part of the series, works as a standalone piece since it’s narratively separate from the previous chapters. , turns the show into a story about internal strife in an Italian mafia full of people with ridiculous psychic abilities.,The series is ostensibly built on putting its characters in incredibly melodramatic and increasingly ridiculous situations. For instance, the main crew gets stuck on a train with someone who is trying to kill them with his ability to make people age quickly in enclosed spaces. So they hide in a living room created by a psychic turtle inside its shell. , makes the characters so appealing that wondering how they’ll get out of these situations matters more than the completely incomprehensible nature of their problems., manages to really distill this aspect of the series by offering up a small crew of people the viewers really want to root for. They’re gangsters, but their camaraderie and backstories, which reveal how they came to be so close, make them engaging. So does the constant danger they experience, especially since they usually don’t make it out unscathed. The audience’s constant concern for their safety feels justified. It isn’t just manipulative melodrama without consequences."

Little America has small ideas about the immigrant experience,"
          Jan 28, 2020,  9:20am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"According to its ,, , is “an anthology of funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring, and surprising stories about the lives of immigrants in the United States.” Its first season, released this month on the streaming service, is a collection of eight half-hour stories about immigrants who are trying to make it in the US. It’s the best show Apple has produced so far, but it’s also the most misguided. ,It almost hurts, considering the talent behind ,. Created by Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Lee Eisenberg, just about every episode is an excellent half-hour of television. Each actor on-screen is wonderful to watch, warm and likable at all times. The array of brown faces in front of and behind the camera is dazzling: Uchenna “Conphidance” Echeazu, Eshan Inamdar, Kemiyondo Coutinho, and Tze Chun are actors and filmmakers from a wide variety of backgrounds. The stories they tell (all based on real life) stop just shy of being saccharine.,The trouble is the framing. Like many immigrant stories, they are about overcoming or confronting nigh-insurmountable hardships. In “The Manager,” protagonist Kabir is 12 years old when his parents are deported, and he must take over the family motel, raising himself and running a business while writing obsessively to the government about his parents being readmitted into the country. He will not see them in person again until he is an adult.  In “The Son,” a gay Syrian man flees his family who reacted violently to discovering his orientation, crossing the border into Jordan in the hopes that he can one day claim asylum in the United States. “The Rock” is about an Iranian father who wants to purchase a home in the US but cannot afford it. Instead, he buys a plot of land with a massive, unremovable rock on it and commits to removing it, one chunk at a time. The house is never built.,Because , positions these stories as “inspiring,” it’s worth thinking about why. ,The idea is that we do not see these people represented very often — people who, in the real world, suffer all manner of prejudice and setbacks because they have dared to live a life in a country that is not made for them, even as it postures as the land of opportunity. ,, and works like it, exist as an act of empathy: look at these people. They just want the same simple things you do. A home, a business, a job, love. There are so many shades to the same story. ,But the exceptional nature of ,’s subjects plays into the idea that immigrants must earn our empathy, earn the right to be in the US, earn the mere chance to find happiness. In the US, stories like these are treated like a guidebook for citizenship if you’re a person of color and “inspiring” fodder for white people who want to believe themselves tolerant.,In another, more equitable pop culture landscape, maybe ,would land better. There is room for stories like these, and it bears repeating: it’s pretty good television! What hurts the series most is its frequent refusal to acknowledge that there are , its characters struggle with such hardship. In ,, coming to the United States to make a life is just ,, and the reasons are irrelevant — when, in fact, they are vital. ,The episodes that rise above this are the ones that show , each character faces the plight they do. “The Son” makes it immediately clear why a gay man must flee his Syrian family. In “The Grand Prize Expo Winners,” a Chinese woman wins a cruise for herself and her children. During their time at sea, her dreams of the American life she has obtained and the dreams her children have after being raised in the US come into quiet conflict. The bittersweet nature of the immigrant experience is made tangible for half an hour. ,These episodes are the exceptions. A good second season of , (which is already on the way) would follow their lead. A better one would ditch our cultural fixation on immigrant struggle porn entirely. ,There is dignity in being unremarkable. A noble life can be lived by those who are not paragons, by people getting by on wages too small in homes that do not fit their families in less-than-desirable neighborhoods. , wants its audience to regard immigrants as fully realized people.

Disney’s direct-to-consumer division is centralized, giving executives within the division more control over their streaming businesses.

Galavant was the decade’s most underrated show that no one watched,"

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"“,” ,So begins the tale of ,, , that ran in 2015 and (somehow) returned for an even longer second season the following year.,On the surface, it’s a generic send-off of the fantasy genre that plays like a watered down version of , (with a little less heart and a little more snark). But , has a trick up its sleeve — it’s also a musical, a song-and-dance affair like a live-action Disney movie of old. , like a Disney movie, in fact, given that the songs were all written by the legendary Alan Menken (,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,) and co-collaborator Glenn Slater. ,The show starts by setting up a classic fairy-tale story in its , — Galavant is a gallant knight, riding to save his beloved Madalena from the clutches wicked King Richard — and then promptly blows the entire premise to bits. ,What follows are a few hours of fantasy-fueled musical comedy. There are jousts. There are sword fights. There are a variety of guest cameos. And of course, there are lot of enjoyable tunes, which range from clever to impossible to get out of your head. ,The cast is great, too: Joshua Sasse plays the titular hero, given equal opportunities to flex his golden pipes and biceps; Karen David is the iron-willed Princess Isabella, and Mallory Jansen is Galavant’s trope-dodging lost love Madalena. But the standout is Timothy Omundson’s King Richard, the initial antagonist who steals the show as a blustering, bumbling dictator with a heart of gold (and a truly magnificent beard). It helps that nearly all of the main cast can actually sing well, which means that there’s less of the awkwardness and auto-tuning typical of a Very Special Musical Episode from most shows. ,It’s not deep, but it’s deeply fun, especially if you (like me) particularly enjoy Disney renaissance movies and stage musicals. Thanks to its very unpopular nature, , is also extremely short, the kind of thing you can easily binge on a weekend when it’s too cold to go outside. To say that almost no one watched the first season of the show is an understatement — it was one of ABC’s worst shows that year — and despite a cliffhanger ending, it seemed like , was doomed to be nothing more than an easily missed blip on ABC’s schedule. ,Except, for some reason, it wasn’t. ABC gave the show a “miracle” renewal for a second season, and , delivered one of the most satisfying sequels of the decade. Season 2 takes everything further: more songs, more episodes, more off-kilter fairy-tale wackiness. The first episode, titled “A New Season ... aka Suck It Cancellation Bear” (a reference to ,) starts with a song that sees the , and features a shameless appeal to viewers to watch , instead of football, the Golden Globes, or , ,.

It also means that all the music is available to listen to, which you will mostly likely want to do after watching ,.  ,That the show even got renewed at all is a wild story. , was announced as part of ABC’s lineup in 2014, before being consigned to the mid-season break as filler for , Sunday night slot. (ABC had so little faith in the series that the eight-episode season was actually condensed into four weeks, with two episodes airing each Sunday). As expected, ratings were dismal, with the adorable musical comedy series being utterly crushed by ABC’s generally poor viewership, playoff football games, and award shows like the Golden Globes. A cancellation was all but guaranteed — except that ,was a favorite of then-ABC president Paul Lee, who ordered a second season against all odds (and against all common sense, if we’re being totally honest).,’s renewal — along with another season for the also poorly performing Marvel spinoff , — was part of Lee’s strategy to create “sticky” content that bet more on building brands with long-term cultural staying power over immediate rating success. This bet would spectacularly fail — ,, both ,and ,swiftly returned to lose half of their already poor audiences, and Lee was soon ousted and replaced by Channing Dungey. ,Lee’s ideas (and ,) might have just been a little ahead of its time; today’s streaming era puts a far bigger emphasis on word-of-mouth success and cultural mindshare than it does hard numbers about who’s watching.

"Netflix’s The Witcher is a dark, funny, and faithful adaptation of the fantasy series","
          Dec 20, 2019,  3:01am EST
        ",Andrew Webster,"You learn nearly everything you need to know about , hero Geralt (Henry Cavill) a few minutes into the first episode. The titular witcher — a work-for-hire monster hunter with some helpful superpowers — is first seen in a swamp, nearly killed by a giant spider monster, beaten and almost drowned. In the next scene, Geralt heads to a local pub for information on his next quest, only to be subjected to ridicule and scorn from villagers who are scared of his supernatural nature. Ultimately, he’s saved from a barroom brawl thanks to a helpful young woman, who very quickly becomes a romantic partner.,The Netflix adaptation captures the enigmatic hero perfectly. He’s struggling to survive in a world that hates him, stubbornly sticking to a moral code that forces him into dangerous  situations. He’s gruff and sarcastic, always down for a fight, impossibly charming, and frequently irresistible. It’s a premise that worked well in book and video game form — and now it’s one of the best series on Netflix., is based on a series of fantasy novels from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which reached a new level of global popularity thanks to a series of video games. ,, in particular, propelled the franchise to blockbuster status. Every iteration follows Geralt, part of an ancient and dwindling line of monster hunters known as witchers. They’re mutated from a young age to be stronger and faster, and the process also gives them limited magical abilities and prolonged life spans. Geralt is a gunslinger type, moseying into a town in trouble, slaying the inevitable magical beast, collecting his pay, and moving on.,In this way, , is different than most fantasy stories, including obvious contemporaries like ,. It does have the elements of a vast epic tale — including plenty of political machinations and lots of warring kingdoms — but at its best, , is like a fantastical detective series, with Geralt investigating dangerous magical creatures and inevitably being pulled into much bigger conspiracies.,What makes the new show work so well is the way it seamlessly blends together these two types of storytelling. There , an interesting overarching story. In addition to Geralt, the show also follows Ciri, a young princess with mysterious powers who is on the run from a rival kingdom, and Yennefer, a fiercely independent sorceress with grand ambitions. Viewers follow along as their three paths inevitably intertwine. But instead of the serialized approach favored by prestige television, for much of its runtime , has more of a “creature of the week” structure. (This changes in the final two episodes as the season rushes towards a conclusion that very clearly sets up the second season.),Each episode — many of which are based explicitly on short stories from the books — tasks Geralt with solving a different monster-related problem, whether that’s a princess turned into a beast, or a vengeful djinn who has cursed his best friend, the bard Dandelion (who primarily goes by Jaskier in the show). The structure feels true to the spirit of the series, while also making it work well for television.,It also means that the show demands a bit more from viewers. Events in , don’t always unfold in chronological order, and there’s no explicit indication of whether you’re watching a scene in the past or present. Instead, you have to sort out the timing based on contextual clues: a line about an event you’ve already seen, or how close two characters have become. (Figuring out the timing isn’t helped by the fact that witchers and sorcerers barely age.) It took me a few episodes to get a solid sense of things. This also means , benefits from repeat viewings, where you can pick up on small details you may have missed the first time.,The most important part of ,, though, is Geralt himself. I’ll admit: I was nervous after seeing the initial photos of Henry Cavill in a Party City-esque white wig, but he absolutely nails the role. His Geralt is the exact right blend of scary, sexy, and sarcastic. Even his gravelly voice is perfect. The wig may look strange at times, but ultimately it doesn’t distract from what makes Geralt interesting. You even get to see him in multiple ,.,As a TV show, , is particularly refreshing in an era full of nihilistic fantasy stories inspired by ,. Yes, the show gets brutal at times. The wonderfully choreographed fight scenes are extremely violent, as is one very particular and hard-to-watch magical transformation. It’s a show where — shock! — the bad guys are usually humans, not monsters. What makes , feel different, though, is in the details. These stories aren’t full of people being awful for the sake of it; they’re making choices based on love or survival, and then things go wrong. What makes , so compelling is how it delves into these gray areas, exploring why people do what they do. By the end, you’ll have some measure of sympathy for almost everyone, no matter how irredeemable they might seem at first.,Crucially, , has a sense of humor. It’s not all dark and dire. Jaskier (Joey Batey) frequently plays the comedy relief, following Geralt around despite not being welcome, in order to turn Geralt’s exploits into song, sometimes breaking the fourth wall in the process. “There I go again,” he says at one point, “just delivering exposition.” When he meets the witcher for the first time, the bard tells him “I love the way you just sit in a corner and brood.” Meanwhile, Geralt’s quietly sarcastic nature is on full display. He can cut through any situation, no matter how awkward or horrible, with a frustrated “fuck.” And one of the show’s most dramatic sex scenes is accompanied by a playful jig and gawking onlookers making jokes.,could’ve very easily turned out wrong. It’s not hard to misinterpret what it is that actually makes the series interesting, but the TV adaptation gets it. ,is funny, intense, and uncomfortable, and it balances out those disparate emotions almost perfectly. Yes, it stars Henry Cavill in a bad white wig, but you’ll forget about all of that as soon as he starts talking."

But it was the next scene that got me fully on board, one that showed that Rorschach, the original comic’s most popular character, was a hero to white supremacists. It felt transgressive but also right — and then I flipped back to the comic and you know what? It ,right. The TV , sold me on its relevance by resurfacing something incredibly obvious about its source material that years of fan culture had scrubbed away, mostly because the character looked cool. ,There’s an understandable urge to laud popular culture that ,, to credit shows or movies that address injustices or give a platform to the marginalized. It’s a good impulse, even if it leads to overly forgiving criticism. So it’s important to note that, while , is definitely one of this year’s best shows for the provocative way it centers race in a way that both mainstream entertainment and pundits often do not, it’s also incredible for being fun as hell. There’s time travel, killer action, a deep conspiracy, and a great love story. There’s a lot there — maybe too much to end well. And you know what? If it doesn’t, that’s fine.,In 2019, , (the comic) was arguably more trouble than it’s worth. As a work of comics, it’s as good as everyone says, a rich reading experience that’s held up for decades. As a cultural touchstone, however, it’s been a disaster, inspiring a whole generation of creators and fans who were more fascinated in its “realistic” take on superheroes than its pervasive ideas about a world marching toward its own annihilation, and the cultural attitudes that brought it to the brink of doomsday. ,One way to measure the success of HBO’s , has been how satisfying it is to watch the show completely rewrite its source material, trading its anxieties for current ones, taking its criticisms of superhero fiction and extending it further to make it a criticism of power and the whiteness of that power. In this new ,, superheroes aren’t just the purview of thrill-seekers and proto-fascists. They’re how white supremacy digs its roots deeper into the culture: not just by seizing power, but also by seizing our fantasies. We all wanted to be heroes, but white faces were the only ones behind all the masks and superpowers, by design. ,And so, across the eight episodes leading up to this finale, , took a sledgehammer to this foundation. It corrected its fictional history the way we have begun to correct our real one, re-centering the main thrust of its stories on the people of color previously ignored. Hooded Justice, the first superhero, is not the white man historians assumed he was, but a black hero born from the trauma of the Tulsa race riot and refused justice at every turn by the racist country he tried to serve, first in war, and then with a badge. Doctor Manhattan, the godlike superhuman, is reinvented under the guise of Cal Abar, a black man living in Oklahoma. The villain of the show is a folksy white senator, friendly and seemingly well-intentioned, secretly leading a cabal of racists who want to help him steal the powers of a god, simply because he feels entitled to take them. ,The ,comics are celebrated because they challenged popular notions about superheroes and comics, changing our perceptions of what they could be. Over thirty years later, HBO’s , is doing the same thing, by upending the foundation of , itself. If it never gets a second season, that’d be enough — even if the finale doesn’t quite stick the landing."
How to avoid Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker spoilers,"

When , was released, the film’s biggest plot twist was hidden within a misleading video titled something like “LMAO funny Madden 16 glitches.” (Needless to say, there were no funny , glitches to be found.),Of course, the most logical suggestion for avoiding them is to simply log off indefinitely, but that’s probably not going to happen.,There are several ways to remain spoiler-free without curtailing your computer or phone use. If you spend a ton of time on Twitter, ,. Facebook doesn’t allow for the filtering of specific keywords, although you can snooze groups that you follow for 30 days if there’s one whose participants usually share spoilers. ,If you want broader protection across the web, that comes in the form of browser extensions.

The page lets you add specific keywords to block, along with the action that you’d like performed when you stumble upon that keyword. You can also turn off images and videos associated with that keyword. ,Spoiler Protection 2.0 is , aggressive at blocking things, so that’s a good sign that it works. But with videos and photos switched off, it impacts more than just the content related to your spoiler keywords. YouTube still works, but most other photos and videos just stop loading at all. ,As my colleague Thomas Ricker put it ,, Unspoiler is the “scalpel” method of blocking spoilers online. Put up against Spoiler Protection 2.0, which is more of a blunt tool for eliminating any trace of a spoiler, this is a lighter, more precise solution. ,Once Unspoiler is activated in your Google Chrome browser, enter any keywords that you’d like to remain happily oblivious to. This extension does a good job of censoring headlines and blocking certain images related to your keywords. Chances are pretty good that you’ll remain spoiler-free, though it doesn’t block quite everything. A Google search, for instance, revealed several pictures, and website synopses aren’t covered up.,There are actually countless ways to block spoilers on your browser, but if you’re looking for a mobile solution, your options are more limited. Besides the aforementioned Spoiler Protection 2.0 add-on, the only other satisfactory one I found was an Android app called ,, which acts like Spoiler Protection 2.0 by applying a hard block of color over every page element that makes a mention of your spoiler keyword. It’s a bit drastic, though it’s cool that it can draw over every app you have installed on your phone.  ,Spoilers don’t bother everyone, but if you’re like me, you prefer to stay in the dark until you can enjoy a new movie, TV show, or game with fresh eyes. These extensions aren’t a perfect solution, but they’re definitely useful for keeping spoilers out of sight until you get caught up."

But if you’re coming to the books from the TV show, I’d recommend first delving into the short story collections, which predate the novels. There are two of them — , and ,— and both feature tales that form the basis for many of the show’s best episodes. The episode “Rare Species,” for instance, is based on the story “The Bounds of Reason” from ,, while the disturbing story “The Witcher” in , is the core of the episode “The Betrayer Moon.”,There are differences between the books and the show, of course. The Netflix series also weaves in an overarching story about warring kingdoms and the importance of destiny, which is largely absent from the short stories. But the two complement each other well, and they follow a similar structure, jumping back and forth in time with reckless abandon. In my opinion at least, , is at its best in this more standalone format, with Geralt investigating a new monster-related tragedy in each story. These two books will give you plenty of that.,You might be tempted to start from the beginning when it comes to the games. But I’d recommend sticking with the most recent entry in the series. Unlike books, games tend to age poorly, and this is particularly true for RPGs where quality-of-life updates can make older titles a chore to play through. But 2015’s , still feels fantastic today, and it’s the best — and most ambitious — entry in the series. It shifts things toward an open-world structure, and it’s filled with the same morally complex storytelling that makes the TV show so compelling. The two don’t cross over much, though; Netflix’s , is explicitly based on the books. And despite the three in the title, you don’t need to play the previous games to understand what’s going on.,Now is also the best time to play ,. For one thing, the game received two massive expansions, so if you’re just starting, you have , of video game in front of you. (The main story lasts dozens of hours on its own.)

Uh, okay.,And in the finale, we finally learned that the island kept its mystical energy because... a plug in a pool kept the island’s magical water from draining away. Following season after season of increasingly clever answers to increasingly clever mysteries, seeing the banal reality of a giant drain stopper was something of a letdown.,But I loved the finale anyway. Instead of checking off every box, executive producers Carlton Cuse (who has since created , and Amazon’s , series) and Damon Lindelof (, and HBO’s ,) instead packed the finale with as many unforgettable character-driven moments as they could. And that, in retrospect, is what the show was , the best at the whole time, anyway. Who can forget iconic moments like “,,” the reveal of the show’s ,, and ,?,Ironically enough, the finale made its character moments really shine by paying off , mystery in a huge way. Season 6 played with , trope of flashbacks or flash-forwards by instead presenting flash-,a weird alternate reality where Oceanic Flight 815 didn’t crash. In the flash-sideways, the characters apparently have no knowledge of their connections on the island. The audience doesn’t know what the point of the flash-sideways was — until they reach the series finale. By that time, the audience knows that the show’s characters can “wake up” from the flash-sideways and suddenly recollect their lives on the island.,These sepia-toned recollections are powerful flashes of each character’s most memorable plots throughout the entire show, usually with their one true love, and each is backed by the very best of Michael Giacchino’s amazing soundtrack. The finale gives us ,: , how they rekindled their relationship and eventually died together. , how they fell in love. , their amazing, wonderful, best-ever relationship. ,These moments of recollection in the finale were beautiful when I first watched the final episode live in May 2010. But when I recently rewatched the episode, sitting next to the person I would marry six days later, these scenes , me. I cried at every single one.,I’ve come to realize that the point of the finale, and perhaps all of ,, wasn’t to get answers to the plot questions that got many of us to care about the show in the first place. (That is something I also think is true about most of the recent enduring prestige TV dramas, including ,, ,, and, yes, even ,.) The point was to deliberately show that the real journey, and I mean this with no irony, was the friends the characters made along the way — and maybe that’s what the journeys of our real lives are, too."

The Mandalorian shows why Star Wars should be smaller ,"
          Dec 28, 2019, 10:30am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Two months ago, just before , was about to premiere on Disney+, I made a joke to some friends: wouldn’t it be funny if this show was better than ,? I thought it was unlikely, but possible: ending a trilogy well is hard, and , didn’t have nearly as many expectations riding on it. Eight weeks later and , is out, a very profitable ,, and , concludes its first season with a finale that doesn’t try for much, but also rocks. It is, surprisingly, the better Star War.,(Very mild spoilers to follow.),Most of the reasons why I like , boil down to restraint: It’s full of things most Star Wars movies , do. It doesn’t have a Jedi, or anyone who’s even , of the Force. It’s not about a Chosen One. It’s not even particularly concerned with its place in any grand narrative — sure, the show makes it easy to figure out that it’s set after , and there are a number of familiar , accoutrements. But its overall story? Very much doing its own thing. ,Let’s recap: The eponymous Mandalorian is a bounty hunter who takes a high-paying job for a former Imperial officer. That job turns out to be a child with special powers. He decides not to hand the child over to the definitely evil Imperial holdouts, and goes on the run. The stoic Mandalorian and the adorable baby have adventures, most of them aiming for you to say, “Hey, that’s cool” about two or three times per episode. ,I love how inconsequential , feels, especially since the , films have been about people doing Big Important Things involving the fate of the galaxy or whatever. It even ends with a reassertion of the status quo: Mando and The Child, out and about. What will they find next?,A big part of the , charm is the way that it feels like a world you can live in. And ,? It shows people just trying to get by, out in the galactic equivalent of a small midwestern farm town. Sure, the Empire has fallen and the New Republic is starting to get its feet (only to fall again by the time , rolls around) but none of that matters. Out here, they’re just trying to raise ugly lizards and gas up their spaceships so they can make it to the next job. ,Now that I’ve seen it, this is the , I want more of. Smaller stories, about smaller people, being noble or selfish in ways that ripple through their own communities, not the whole damn galaxy. It’s this implication at the heart of , that made that movie so compelling, and the diversions , made into the lives of Clone Troopers fascinating to watch.

"Netflix’s stalker thriller You returns for a second season, and it kills","
          Dec 23, 2019,  9:00am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Perhaps the most deliciously satisfying thing about ,is that it began as a Lifetime show. It seemed to fit right in, too — based on the novel of the same name by Caroline Kepnes, the show followed bookseller Joe Goldberg as he began to stalk a woman named Beck, gradually inserting himself more and more into her life as he attempted to woo her and isolate her from all her friends. You know. Lifetime stuff. ,After a killer-but-little-watched first season, the show migrated to Netflix, where it will maybe find the audience it deserves — and yes, it does deserve it. Because ,masquerades as trashy thriller in order to get you to underestimate it — dismiss it, even — while it goes to work subverting every assumption you had about it. It’s a trick that doesn’t seem repeatable, but in ,’s second season, out December 26th, the show somehow pulls it off.,The second season of , is a bit of a reset. ,’s first season was fairly conclusive (I’ll be vague to preserve the fun for those who haven’t seen it), so in its second season, Joe — trying to start over after the first season’s events in New York — moves to LA, a place he hates, but also a place no one knows him. ,After briefly entertaining the notion of being a changed man who has left his stalking ways behind, Joe quickly falls into his old patterns. This time, his obsession is a woman named Love, his coworker at the hybrid wellness store / bookshop Anavrin. (Spell it backward and groan with me.),At first, it seems like , is simply repeating itself, playing the same beats with a different woman in Joe’s sights. To a certain extent, that’s true — there’s even a running subplot about a troubled woman who lives next door with a plucky kid Joe becomes protective of, a mirror image of season 1 — but as the twists pile up, the reflection comes across as intentional and effective. And it’s not like there aren’t new things happening here. Love’s codependent relationship with her brother takes , into some unexpected places, and the show’s new setting gives it new arenas for exploring toxic masculinity. There’s also some leftover threads from last season that turn the pressure up. And finally, harkening back to a similar moment in season 1, when the show finally breaks free of Joe’s perspective to let the audience in on Love’s side of the story, things , take a turn. ,What makes , subversive, brilliant television is delightfully simple: Joe is an idiot. Sure, he reads a lot of books and, as an observer of people, is pretty deft at manipulating the fundamental selfishness of others. But as a criminal? He’s hilariously incompetent. This is where , twists the knife you never knew it slipped in, because the point of the show is that he doesn’t , to be good at any of this. , makes it easy to condemn Joe because we are privy to his private moments and thoughts, the ways he justifies every overreach and horrible action. But to everyone else? He’s just a man, standing in front of a girl, patiently waiting for her to love him. He benefits from decades of cultural attitudes that have worn away at the agency of women, of romance tropes that valorize the persistence of men in pursuit of a woman, and the gendered head games that give men the upper hand in most every interaction they have. ,It does all this while also being extremely fun pulp nonsense, which somehow makes it feel ,dangerous. Throughout it all, Joe Goldberg is… funny? Sharp? And, thanks to Penn Badgley, perhaps the best voiceover narrator you’ve ever heard? You , Joe, and, because of a combination of Badgley’s performance and the incredible savvy of every member of the crew that points a camera or light at him, you frequently suffer whiplash for liking him, as he goes from charming book nerd to sardonic lead to super creep in the same shot. ,What we call prestige television is often a function of marketing. Prestige shows — the kind of stuff you see on HBO and sweeping the Emmys — involves a lot of putting on airs, signaling an intent to be literary or ambitious. , does no such thing. It is every inch the Lifetime show it began as, and just as wickedly sharp or thoughtful as another show with loftier goals. This makes , feel dangerous. Like it shouldn’t work so well. And then, when you start to think about why it does — well then, the show has you."
"Netflix blew the release for ‘Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,’ the hit song of the season","
          Dec 30, 2019, 12:02pm EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"Netflix’s , adaptation seems to be the streaming service’s latest hit, helped at least in part by the massive viral success of the hit song of the season, “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,” sung by the bard Jaskier (Joey Batey) at the end of the show’s second episode to immortalize the epic deeds of Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill). ,But there’s one huge issue with “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher” (other than the fact that it will get stuck in your head seemingly forever): Netflix hasn’t released it (or any of ,’s soundtrack) for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, or any other major streaming or music purchasing service. ,The only semi-official release of the song, in fact, comes not from Netflix, but from a post from Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli — the composers for ,’s,soundtrack — ,. The post itself has nearly half a million views, which is certainly impressive, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions of plays it has across channels on YouTube — plays that could be going toward an official Netflix release on Spotify or Apple Music (or at the very least, with an official YouTube post from Netflix that links viewers to ,).,It’s not like Netflix couldn’t have seen this coming. ,, Batey commented that, “It’s the most annoying thing I’ve ever heard. It’s so catchy,Later in the interview, Batey elaborated that the song has stuck with him for months, compared to the scant week the rest of the world has had with it. “Everyone’s been listening to it for a week or so now, and humming it. I’ve had that in my head for eight months.” ,In other words, there’s no way that the folks over at Netflix couldn’t be aware that “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher” wasn’t going to blow up. , from Belousova, an official soundtrack release for , is theoretically ready to go, assuming Netflix decides to release it at all. “We have the soundtrack ready to go and can’t wait to get it out, however there’s no ETA at the moment since it is up to Netflix whether or not to make it happen.”,Compare that strategy to shows like ,, which has had official soundtrack releases for its popular songs (like ,) ready to stream just hours after the episodes aired. This kind of brand awareness isn’t a new idea for musically inclined TV shows, either. Series like ,, ,, and , have all experienced the benefits of having songs ready to stream — and potentially go viral across the internet — immediately. Netflix itself has seen the power of having potentially popular songs ready to go: the recently released comedy special , , and , the day it came out, as have plenty of other series (like ,). ,And even if one wanted to argue that there’s no demand for a full , soundtrack, Netflix could have still had just a single ready to drop for “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher” — a move the company has recently used for the original film , and ,. ,It’s possible all this is simply temporary, and Netflix is planning a big release for a, soundtrack down the line. But even if the company does have one in the works, it’ll have missed the viral moment around the song — and there’s no way it’ll be able to recover that."
The Witcher’s success is held back by Netflix’s release strategy in a post-Game of Thrones world  ,"
          Dec 31, 2019,  9:00am EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg," has everything it needs to be Netflix’s next success: popular source material, a massive marketing campaign, a well-received performance by Henry Cavill, and an iconic meme in the form of , Yet, while certainly popular, it doesn’t seem like , is going to become “must see” television like other recent hits, such as , on Disney+ or , on HBO. At least part of the reason why is how Netflix released it: in a single, all-you-can-eat drop — like almost all of its other shows — instead of a more traditional weekly rollout.,Weekly releases have numerous benefits for fans: continued and focused conversation every week around the latest episode, a chance to digest and process events, and fewer demands on viewers’ time upfront. ,By dropping every episode at once, Netflix is sacrificing weekly discussions around , for a short burst of popularity, after which it trickles off into the void as people’s attentions are quickly grabbed by the next big thing. That extra time between episodes would let viewership build over time, as more people hear about the show or proselytize it to their friends.,Compare that to a weekly release, like ,, which captured a burst of attention with each new Baby Yoda GIF, or the weeklong discussions and theorizing that would fill the time between episodes of ,. Not everyone may have been on board with , at first, but when everyone else on the internet started talking about it and sharing GIFs, they may have been willing to give it a shot. ,Weekly releases (at reasonable hours) also transform streaming shows into the kind of appointment television that viewers flock to and watch together, reacting in real time. The weekly release schedule means everyone is roughly at the same place in the series; for the most part, no one is confused about why the song from the bard is a big deal because they haven’t gotten up to that episode yet. ,A weekly release also makes it less of a slog to actually watch a show. Give someone one episode, with the promise of more, and you’ve given them something to look forward to without demanding too much time upfront. Netflix dumps hours of content on viewers at once, demanding that they watch it all in a binge session that the site used to be famous for.,It’s not that , isn’t popular, either: at least one data firm says it’s more popular than ,at least for its first weekend debut, ,. But even if that number is correct, it’s just a single week, compared to the months that , dominated the conversation. How long can , keep that success going with no new episodes to drive viewers back and plenty of other new content waiting in their queues?,None of this is to say that Netflix’s traditional “dump it all in a single day” strategy isn’t always effective. Some of its original series — the three seasons of ,for example, ,, or any of the various Marvel shows it used to make — are filmed and designed as what amounts to a single 10-or-so-hour-long movie that just happens to have convenient episode breaks. While weekly releases still might make more sense, at least from a mindshare perspective, the release strategy there is at least understandable given the nature of the content. ,There was a time when Netflix’s approach was seen as a breath of fresh air, especially compared to the bloated, 24-episode and months-long seasons that dominated traditional broadcast. Netflix’s strategy killed the cruft, and promised an almost cinematic-like experience where the entire show hit at once. But hours-long TV show seasons aren’t movies, and trying to force episodic stories into a cinematic box just doesn’t work. ,Even among Netflix’s shows, though, , in particular feels designed for a weekly release, given the literal “monster-of-the-week” style plotting that (at least for part of the season) sees Geralt go somewhere and fight something in fairly self-contained chunks. Add in the , and developing storylines, and you’ve got a show that’s almost tailor-made for today’s ,/ ,/ ,-style cottage industry that loves to theorize and debate over shows. It’s hard to have a , podcast series, for example, when all the discussion happens over the course of a weekend. , style juggernauts are few and far between, even as more and more companies try to hit whatever magic combination of popularity and quality makes a show so hyped. Not every show will be the next , or , — take Apple TV Plus’ ,, which had a weekly release, huge budget, and star-studded cast but still flopped by virtue of not being very good. , probably won’t be the next ,It’s probable that no show ever will be: the success of , looks increasingly like a once-in-a-generation type of occasion. But Netflix’s release strategy isn’t giving its best shows the chance to even try, with the service choosing to burn off all its content in a single shot instead of a slower burn that could see it rise to greater heights.

(And you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking that — in November, Disney did , that it, unlike some other services, wouldn’t have a “rotating slate” of licensed movies each month.) But that doesn’t exactly appear to be true, given that some movies have already been removed from the service, less than two months after launch.,Why? My colleague , that these removals are due to issues with legacy licensing deals:,The removals also came as something of a surprise, since Disney didn’t say that they would be leaving the service before pulling them. Content coming and going from streaming services is a reality most consumers are used to at this point, but other streaming services like Netflix and Hulu will at least announce what content is coming and going from their services on a monthly basis. ,It’s unclear when ,, ,, or any of the movies that have already been removed may return to the service, although Disney says it’ll happen at some point. And other movies may also disappear from Disney+ in the future, as , there’s a chance that huge Disney movies like ,and ,, among other late-decade titles,,will return to Netflix starting “around 2026.” That suggests they wouldn’t be available on Disney+ that year — if Disney and Netflix’s current deal stands. But there’s always a chance the company could make a new deal with Netflix — like when it , with Starz to get ,on Disney+ at launch.,What this all means for the future is that Disney+ probably won’t ever have every Disney-owned movie at any one given time, and you can’t necessarily expect anything added to the service to stay forever. Until new and different deals are inked (if they ever are), if you see a movie you want to watch on Disney+, you might want to watch it as soon as you can. "

        ",D. M. Moore,"The new decade is starting with over 35 new anime shows, and more than 15 continuing from 2019. In order to help you weed through all of these shows, I’ve put together a list of six that stand out as being the most interesting, whether you are a newcomer or long-running anime fan. Most of these shows are available for viewing internationally the day after they air in Japan, thanks to streaming services like Amazon, Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, and Hulu.,Besides the series included below, three shows (,,,,,and ,) from , are continuing into the winter, and one show (,) should be getting an international release on Netflix during this season. We’ll continue to update this post as new information concerning where and when these shows are streaming is announced.,Set in a fantasy world where monster-like races rule and humans are persecuted, a golem comes across an abandoned human child, Somali, in the forest. The child mistakes it for her father. With only a little more than a year left in the golem’s lifespan before it completely breaks down, it journeys to try to find a place where Somali can be safe.,This is a show I badly want to be good. The colorfully friendly but intricate look of the world and the people in it is utterly charming in the trailers. And since the show is about the golem and the child journeying through this world, the promise of getting to see more of it — and how cities and communities are interpreted when their inhabitants are monster-like — is greatly appealing. On top of that, this is clearly going to be a very heartstring-pulling story about family, which could make it a really good show for parents to watch with their kids.,started streaming on , January 2nd.,This is the newest anime from Masaaki Yuasa, the director of ,, and his animation studio Science Saru. , is based on a comic of the same name, and follows three first-year high school girls as they attempt to make an anime together: one working as the director / writer, one as the animator, and one as the producer.,I saw a preview of the first ten minutes of the series at Anime NYC, and the involvement of Yuasa and Science Saru is enough to interest me, given their unique kinetic experimental style of animation. But that’s not all: seeing what that means for a show about animation is a whole other thing, with them trying out all sorts of techniques and ideas to convey how the girls develop their anime. ,could potentially be the first great new anime of the 2020s decade.,will stream on , starting January 5th.,This is a new adaptation to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of the series’ original light novel. The story follows Orphen, a young but powerful sorcerer. Orphen left his home to find a way to save his sister, who was magically turned into a dragon and then disappeared. While searching for her and for a cure, he also has to protect her from other sorcerers looking to kill her.,From the trailer, it seems that this anime is keeping to a very classic late ‘90s style, but made with modern techniques and technology. With the animation being handled by Studio Deen (,), it should look good both during action scenes and more character-driven dramatic moments as well. Perhaps most notably, the story has been adapted by Reiko Yoshida, who wrote the excellent adaptations of ,,,,,and , for Kyoto Animation., will stream on , starting January 7th.,Chiyuki Fujito dreams of becoming a fashion model in Paris for her father’s modeling agency, but she’s too short. At school she discovers that her classmate Ikuto Tsumura is a talented and aspiring fashion designer, but is putting off his dream so that he can help support his mom and so his three younger sisters can go to college. After Ikuto makes a dress for Chiyuki that goes viral, their dreams become intertwined.,The concept for , intrigued me enough to look more into it, and I read the first chapter of the manga (which is ,). In that chapter, there is a good mix of drama and humor. The characters are clearly dealing with a lot of issues, but that isn’t the sole thing that defines them, allowing them to be more multifaceted. Because of this, along with its fairly unusual subject matter, I have high hopes for the show.,will stream on , starting January 10th.,After a three-year hiatus, one of the best sports anime ever returns. The series follows Shoyo, who is considered too short to be a volleyball player, and the other talented and scrappy players that make up the Karasuno high school volleyball team as they try to become the best team in Japan. This new season picks up with the Karasuno team training for their trip to Tokyo for the national tournament., manages to stand above a lot of sports shows by not only having great volleyball action (that is beautifully animated and easy to follow even if you don’t know the sport), but also by having a large cast of characters that you come to care about. Every match isn’t just a sports contest, but an opportunity to explore a player or team’s storyline. It is full of moments that challenge the characters’ development and growth as players and as people. So while this season is probably not a great one to jump in if you’re new to the series, it is still a great excuse to start watching.,will stream on , starting January 10th.,In a rusted-out post-apocalyptic city called the Hole, people live in fear of sorcerers who come to their dimension to test out their powers on humans. Caiman was cursed by one such sorcerer, and is now a giant lizard-man with no memory of who he really is. He searches the Hole for the sorcerer who cursed him, whom he can identify by the face that appears in his throat when he puts a sorcerer’s head in his mouth.,I’ve long heard friends sing the praises of the , manga which, despite its gritty setting, is more fun and comedic than it might look. And it’s in incredibly good hands with director Yuichiro Hayashi, probably best known for directing both seasons of the visually stunning ,; writer Hiroshi Seko, who did the adaptations for , and both seasons of ,; and animation studio MAPPA, responsible for ,and ,. Given the staff and source material, it seems likely this will be one of the best new anime this year., will stream on ,; the US airdate has not yet been announced, but should be sometime this year.

It’s Matt Lauer. Farrow’s reporting took place (about a year) before allegations of sexual assault would be leveled against the venerable ,anchor. At the beginning of ,, Farrow details a meeting he had with Lauer, one of the few people at NBC supportive of the Weinstein story. Feeling reassured by the encouragement of the network’s biggest figure, Farrow leaves Lauer’s office, and notices a peculiar thing: a button under the desk that closes the door behind him.,, the mega-expensive prestige drama launching on Apple TV Plus, imagines the aftermath of a beloved anchor felled by the revelations of his sexual misconduct. The allegations are not as severe as Lauer’s — the show , its audience all sex was consensual — but it’s hard not to see him in the character of Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), repeatedly referred to as the “dad” of morning news and donning a name that even sounds like a bizarro-universe Matt Lauer.,It is not Kessler but his co-host Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) who has to deal with the fallout immediately. They’ve been on , together for nearly two decades — the mom and dad of America for a program with the tagline “Start your day with your family”— and Alex scrambles to figure out how to address the news of her fired co-host, and who will replace him. To further matters, Alex is deeply concerned about her own contract with the show being renewed, which makes you wonder if the most important question here is whether she can keep her job., is a confounding series full of actors you like, none of whom seem particularly thrilled to be there. In addition to Carell and Aniston, Reese Witherspoon plays Bradley Jackson, a small-time news anchor with the least convincing southern accent I’ve heard since Cindy in ,. A clip of her screaming at a coal protest goes viral, and through a series of bewildering decisions by Alex and her boss, Bradley is suddenly in the running to replace Mitch.,Mitch, by the way, is far from cast off in the show. ,explores how one might wrestle with the repercussions of being Me Too’d. That turns out to be little more complicated than watching Carell bash a flat screen TV out of anger, and then later, unbelievably, tell an old colleague, “At first they came for the rapists, and I said nothing.” That’s probably the nadir of ,’s writing, the rest of it largely — if not clumsily — functional, but Carell does himself no favors by confusing awkward yelling with compelling acting. (In fact, his tantrums are not far off from his character in ,.) ,The only actor on , who seems to be having any fun is Billy Crudup as Cory Ellison, a caricature of a network exec. Still, he moves through the show effortlessly with a smarmy charm (schmarm?), even though his motivations are more inscrutable than they are Machiavellian. At one point, Crudup shouts “chaos is the new cocaine,” and he almost gets away with it.,Most of the dialogue involves characters announcing how they feel. When they’re not, it sounds like they’re telling jokes without punchlines, like when Levy says, “People are idiots. Am I right?” At times, you can sense the show’s aspirations to be something of the Aaron Sorkin universe, except it possesses none of Sorkin’s strengths (the briskly paced chattiness; frequent levity) and most of his weaknesses (a privileged, navel-gazing sense of self-righteousness; the attempts at inclusion that end up feeling kind of racist). The show even looks deeply bland, which honestly might be the most refreshing non-decision in a world where every streaming show is basked in moody, saturated colors or attempts to evoke realism by shooting on handheld cameras.,Similarly, you could also describe the politics of , as glossy and uncomplicated. Predictably, the fight for journalism is basically divided between good, salt-of-the-earth folks like Bradley and greedy, cynical execs like Cory. At one point, the argument is so stark that Cory says, in all seriousness, “What we really need on television right now — it’s not news, or fucking journalism. It’s entertainment.” (Again, somehow Crudup sells this without batting an eye. Give this handsome man an Emmy!),Still, Jackson and Ellison’s dynamic is the show’s most intriguing one — a strength of on-screen chemistry — even if it is still situated in a very basic idea of an employee being real spunky with her boss. In fact, , constantly addresses the notion of power and who has it, but never seems interested in how or why. Network execs are powerful because they’re at the top. Anchors like Levy have power, too, because they’re famous and in front of cameras (though the show finds the most improbable ways for her to wield it). ,But for a series that wants to run at Me Too, it has little to no curiosity in how bad behavior is ignored, allegations are suppressed, or the people and institutions that keep it this way. Farrow’s book revealed the insidious and very deliberate ways men like Weinstein, Lauer, and Tom Brokaw could protect themselves through intimidation and NDAs. In ,, everyone is just too dang earnest, or really, too selfish to think about anyone but themselves.,Even the time we spend with Mitch, whose arc is unclear (though my hope is that it goes in the direction of “acceptance” rather than “redemption”), feels unearned. We get scenes like the one where he struggles to work the Keurig machine in his home. He gets frustrated, then furious, but eventually figures out how to operate the very simple coffee machine. And we’re supposed to feel… what exactly? It’s unclear. It seems fitting that , is the key launch title for Apple’s major foray into original content. This is a company that values simplicity, clarity, and loves smooth corners so much that they designed their headquarters to be completely without rough edges.,There are hints of promise, though. At the end of the third episode, the last that was screened in advance to critics, a producer, Mia Jordan (Karen Pittman), wanders into the now-vacant office of Mitch Kessler. She admires his things, gazes in the mirror, and locates a button under the desk. The door of the office closes. The short scene suddenly gives , a sense of menace and foreboding that had been missing for the previous three hours. Mia then goes to Levy’s office to confront her about how complicit she was in Mitch’s behavior. And suddenly , has its first interesting moment, because it finally wants things to be messy."

It’s the one where Jason Momoa’s character picks up a book for the first time. Since the show is set centuries after a virus deprived humanity of sight, he has no idea what’s in his hands. He complains it smells like “dead bark” and holds it the way a toddler might hold a vegetable when they were in fact expecting a cookie. Then Alfre Woodard’s character demands he hand over what he’s found, and speaks its long-forgotten name: ,.,It’s extremely funny in context, and probably debilitating out of it.

Makeshift curtains of beads make for boundaries both audible and physical, fights involve a lot of probing contact and grappling (as does sex), and there’s a lot of finger snapping. , is extremely invested in showing you how all this stuff works, so much so that it barely delves into its characters. ,Baba Voss (Jason Momoa) is a man who must take his family on the run after his adopted twins, Kofune and Haniwa, are born with sight. The trouble is, the very idea of sight is heretical — much like witchcraft in colonial America, troublesome people are accused of having the ability to see as justification for burning them alive. And there’s also an evil queen who learns of the twins, and as a religious zealot who worships the “darkness” (by, and I will testify to this in court if I have to, masturbating as she prays) she wants them brought to her for evil queen reasons. ,A generous and forgiving read of , could interpret it as an attempted meditation on knowledge, ignorance, and responsibility, but ,actively resists attempts to latch on to anything of substance it might have to offer. In the first three episodes made available in advance to critics, , is more interested in the logistics of its world than it is in implications. ,Sometimes that leads to fun television. The third episode, the best of that initial bunch, is largely unconcerned with the season’s main arc, instead telling a story where Kofune is kidnapped by slavers and must be rescued. It’s visually striking, introducing a tribe of people that, unbeknownst to them, are living in the ruins of an amusement park. It’s got a killer fight scene, with unique choreography that clearly conveys the limitations and skills of everyone involved and depicts brutal violence with grace and skill. And it’s got personal stakes, which I won’t spoil here because it’s one of the only bits of character backstory you get in the first couple of episodes. ,None of these things make , a more interesting show beyond the hour you spend watching them. It’s cotton candy, a fun confection for one moment, and just plain sugar the next. , is clearly interested in drawing people into its elaborate and well-crafted post-apocalypse, but it’s telling that the only questions I have after watching are purely pedantic ones. Like how did a blind society make such perfect and deadly weapons, or build homes that never leak, or clothes and makeup that look so nice? ,These are questions asked by jerks and spoilsports, and I wish I had better ones to ask of ,. The show is strange, but fails to justify that strangeness with a compelling story, characters, or literally anything other than the list of ideas you and your stoned cousin would come up with if you wondered what it would be like if we all woke up one day totally blind, man.

The sudden announcement of the shutdown comes just a week after a ,saying Sony was looking for a buyer for the service, which has continually lost money for the company since its launch in March of 2015. Sony has repeatedly raised the price of Vue to try to offset its rising costs, most recently ,. ,“Unfortunately, the highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected. Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business,” Sony said in a blog post announcing the shutdown. “PlayStation fans can continue to access movie and TV content through the PlayStation Store on PS4 and via our partnerships with top entertainment apps.”,PlayStation Vue launched four years ago as an early competitor in the so-called pay-TV market, which is a restructured form of cable made popular by companies like Sling. Like most other vendors, Sony offered a skinny bundle of channels with the option to add more premium ones, like sports and entertainment channels, by paying a higher monthly subscription fee. After the price hike, the entry-level Vue plan cost about $50 a month. At its height, Vue amassed about 500,000 subscribers, which is far less than competitors like Sling and YouTube TV, , reported last week. ,Ultimately, it looks like Sony couldn’t make the economics work, as the cost of licensing cable channels far outweighed the money Sony could recoup on subscriptions. Vue’s demise is also a signal that customer interest in traditional cable bundles, skinny or otherwise, continues to shrink. As a result, major players in the entertainment industry are , to compete with Amazon and Netflix. That includes Disney with Disney+, Apple with Apple TV Plus, AT&T with HBO Max, and NBCUniversal with Peacock, among others. "

BoJack Horseman is its own harshest critic,"
          Oct 29, 2019, 10:54am EDT
        ",Jack Godwin,"Few of the viewers tuning into Netflix’s animated series , in 2014 could have anticipated how the series would evolve over the course of its six seasons to date. What began as a pun-filled send-up of celebrity culture and the media circus, set in a world full of anthropomorphic animals, soon presented a nuanced take on mental illness and the cycles of trauma. Before long, series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg was turning this critical eye to his own perceived failings.,From the start, ,was always introspective and prone to putting its characters’ behavior under the microscope. But as the series progressed, the scrutiny became far more intense. Bob-Waksberg eventually turned the show toward examining its own cultural impact, even questioning his desire to self-evaluate. The sixth season, which launched on Netflix on October 25th, continues this pattern of criticism, as the series’s protagonist, depressed former sitcom star BoJack Horseman (Will Arnett) begins his own journey to recovery, interrogating his behavioral patterns and revisiting trauma sites. More so than any fan or commentator, the show holds the top spot as its own harshest critic.,BoJack longs for a life as simple as the one in his former hit sitcom,, where every conflict was resolved in one episode, so everything could reset again. From the beginning, the series made it clear that this fantasy was incompatible with reality, and that BoJack’s refusal to deal with his problems was only going to make things worse. Although Bob-Waksberg set out to subvert viewer expectations, this subversion soon became routine. One woman BoJack dates even highlights this trend by asking him to “do that BoJack thing where you make a big deal over nothing and everyone laughs at you but at the same time relates, because you’re saying all the things polite society won’t.”,For the first few seasons, the show has its cake and eats it, too. Bob-Waksberg mines ,’s sitcom status for all its absurd comedy, such as BoJack’s best friend Todd (Aaron Paul) landing himself in a “two-dates-to-the-prom” situation with rival prison gangs. At other times, the show emphasizes that life rarely fits this structure, such as when BoJack’s former friend and , creator Herb (Stanley Tucci) rejects BoJack’s heartfelt apology, even on his deathbed. The series brings in sitcom tropes and structure to mock them, but also to seriously reflect BoJack’s damaged psyche. ,But from the second season onward, the writers became increasingly aware of their complicity in the sitcom-reset fantasy, and they worked harder to keep their stories from growing stagnant. The show started taking BoJack’s bad behavior to darker corners with plots where he’s caught with a friend’s 17-year-old daughter and a reckless drug-fueled bender with Sarah Lynn (Kristen Schaal), a former ,child actress who had gotten clean and sober. In the season 4 episode “The Old Sugarman Place,” he demolishes his family home in an attempt to “move forward” and return to Los Angeles. This forceful return to the status quo also reflected BoJack’s cycle of delusion and entitlement, as well as his inability to pull himself free from the quagmire of depression.,Dealing with thorny topics like trauma, privilege, mental illness, harassment, and substance abuse isn’t easy, especially when they have to be balanced with animal puns and goofy antics. (“Viva Toddfoolery!”) The writers frequently use comedy to provide catharsis amid tension or tragedy, with Todd getting into a ,caper in the same episode where feminist writer Diane (Alison Brie) faces the fallout of speaking out on sexual misconduct. But the creative team eventually cornered themselves by calling out the incompatibility between real life and sitcom structure, given that they’d set up a scenario where they needed sitcom structure to tell their stories.,By the third season, the episodic cycles of BoJack’s toxic, damaging behavior ran the risk of becoming repetitive and predictable. But the writers acknowledged the problem, with Todd calling out BoJack in the season 3 episode “It’s You”: “You can’t keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself as if that makes it okay — you need to be better!”,This isn’t just Todd pushing back against a friend who is all too ready to be forgiven. It’s the writers examining the impact of their show. It’s one thing to derive comedy from BoJack’s misanthropy, but allowing it to go unchallenged sets a dangerous precedent. Rather than shying away from the question, the creative team wrestled with their purpose as the series progressed. When BoJack plays gritty anti-hero detective Philbert in season 5, Diane questions whether such ultra-dark characters have a negative influence on the viewer. By extension, she’s implicating BoJack’s role within ,, and his effect on the Netflix viewership.,In season 1’s penultimate episode, BoJack asks Diane whether he’s a good person, and she answers with crushing silence. While she later tries to explain that no one is truly good or bad, and that “all you are is just the things that you do,” he still seeks to purge himself of the guilt he feels. Following his toxic mantra, “There’s always more show,” and taking some damaging advice that he should “keep running forward, no matter what,” BoJack avoids confronting his problems and insists he isn’t going to change. He sees Philbert — who he and Diane both helped bring to the screen — as a role model, playing into Diane’s fear that Philbert allows “dumb assholes to rationalize their own awful behavior.”,BoJack explains in the season 5 episode “Head in the Clouds” that Philbert teaches “We’re all terrible, so we’re all okay.” Diane, who is already struggling with her part in creating the show, is horrified by this interpretation, and points out that normalizing and rationalizing harmful behavior is dangerous. During this conversation, the show reaches one of its darkest and most self-critical points by bringing up BoJack’s relationship with Sarah Lynn. She saw him as a father figure even into her adult life as a pop star, but that became complicated when their relationship later turned sexual.,“I’m the one who has suffered the most because of the actions of BoJack Horseman,” he argues. Diane raises his unquestionable negative effect on Sarah Lynn as proof he’s wrong. “That’s been really hard for you, the main character in this story,” she says sarcastically. In one of its most merciless scenes, the writers reflect on their choice to empathize with a character like BoJack. They also seem to lament how they initially played BoJack’s sexual encounter with Sarah Lynn as a gag, and questions the cultural norms they were reinforcing.,Diane isn’t free from criticism, either. She’s often the show’s moral arbiter and its voice of reason, but she subjects herself to severe scrutiny, representing the show’s impulse to endlessly dissect its characters. Diane suggests we should be “asking more of ourselves and the people in our lives,” but she’s told she should also find ways to forgive herself and other people. ,is constantly striving for that balance.,Part of Diane’s self-examination may be inspired by the controversy surrounding her casting. Diane is Vietnamese-American, but she’s played by Caucasian actress Alison Brie. After a fan brought up the issue ,, Bob-Waksberg , he’d “soured on the idea of ‘color-blind’ casting as an excuse to not pay attention.” He later gave a , where he expressed “tremendous guilt” over the casting, and said his “understanding of [his] own responsibility” had changed. The same humble and honest outlook on guilt and responsibility underlies much of the show, especially in its later seasons. It’s notable that season 6 takes the time to answer fan ,, a Caucasian character with a Latinx surname, as if leaving no stone unturned.,The newly released first half of season 6 takes BoJack to rehab, in a recovery process that isn’t just about dealing with addiction, but about questioning the realities of forgiveness and personal change. Even the new opening credits see him passing through past regrets that still linger and threaten his future. A frequent refrain of the show brings together BoJack, seeing himself as a “stupid piece of shit,” and Diane, seeing herself as a “rudderless garbage barge.” They’re both trying their best to forgive each other because they can’t extend that same courtesy to themselves., often explores questions of forgiveness, both between people and between stars and their fans. We may find it easier to forgive BoJack’s mistakes than the unrepentant misogyny Hank Hippopopalous (Philip Baker Hall) exhibits in “Hank After Dark,” but the series has long since outgrown any simple ideas of heroes and villains. Secondary characters like Mr. Peanut Butter and Princess Carolyn — who initially served as counterpoints to BoJack’s pessimism and immaturity, respectively — become deeply flawed characters in their own right. Meanwhile, loathsome antagonists like Vanessa Gekko and Rutabaga Rabitowitz were revealed as the protagonists of their own stories.,As the show heads toward its finale, it’s still exploring that question BoJack asks Diane in season 1: is he a good person at heart, or is it too late for him? The sixth season shows that change is possible for BoJack, as he begins to make amends for the things he’s done, face addiction, and try to forgive himself. The self-examination that has taken place both within the story and in the writing room has demonstrated a maturity capable of tackling such broad and complicated issues. Rather than providing simple platitudes, the series brings its characters together through empathy rather than sympathy, and honesty over blind faith. Being its own harshest critic has let , evolve, and be the best version of itself."

        ",Julia Alexander,"If ,is , crown-jewel prestige drama and ,is its bet on sci-fi programming, , is its most fun. Circumventing Apple’s idea of what a prestigious show should look like brings some much needed carefreeness to the streaming platform.  ,The show finds Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld) in the 1850s as she struggles to follow her dreams of becoming a poet at a time when female writers were frowned upon. Her father Edward (Toby Huss) sours at the idea of people in Massachusetts finding out she’s a writer, afraid of the shame she’ll bring to their family. Only two people support her ambitious desires: George Gould (Samuel Farnsworth), a local literary magazine editor who also wants to marry Emily, and Sue Gilbert (Ella Hunt), her best friend turned secret lover.,Using period-accurate costumes and sets gives it a slightly prestigious feel, but the dialogue is deliberately contemporary. Characters speak to one another like they’re living in modern times, cursing at each other and saying things like, “What up, girl?” Though ,feels like it’s nearing disaster at times, the show’s best moments come when it leans into its own absurdity: when a science experiment is used to simulate an orgasm, or a house party devolves into maelstrom as underage teens mess around with opioids, twerking to pulsating trap music.,doesn’t have the boundary-pushing ,, HBO’s popular teen drama that aired over the summer, but it’s unabashed in its admiration for youth culture. Teens in ,are unapologetically teens. Relationships are intoxicating, self-discovery is angst-ridden, and the future is full of endless possibilities built on beautifully reckless dreams only teenagers can have.,Emily Dickinson’s poems are obsessed with youthful themes: fame, popularity, intense bouts of emotion and, of course, a fetishization of death. Her work isn’t changed in ,. The stanzas are true to the source material. Modernizing the way characters speak to each other, but keeping the poems consistent, allows Dickinson’s words to feel more approachable for an audience that came into their own by way of Lil Peep Instagram live-streams and SoundCloud emo rap.,Most brilliantly, ,isn’t trying to be a teen show. That’s precisely why it works as one. It kind of stumbles into itself, finding its footing along the way. There isn’t any clear direction or structure to help it stay on the same path. ,doesn’t shy away from ludicrousness, but leans into it unabashedly. It’s an “unapologetic, crying on the floor at two in the morning, flirting with the fetishization of death even when floating on the undeniable highness of life” type of disaster. ,That’s especially true when it comes to Emily’s forbidden relationship with Sue. Steinfeld and Hunt charm whenever they’re on-screen together, excellent at playing up grandeur expressions of their love for each other while putting just as much importance into the small gestures that cement their relationship. They’re giddy when with each other, full of sneaky kisses and uncontrollable giggles that define first loves.,Although their relationship is forbidden, made harder by Sue’s engagement to Emily’s brother, Austin (Adrian Enscoe), it’s never tragic. Their obsession with each other is all-encompassing. Everything is carefree and in the moment. It’s not fraught with drama or cocooned in sadness the way other queer relationships on TV can be, especially with younger characters. Emily is upset by Sue’s engagement, but even that isn’t enough to drive them apart. They simply exist, together, now.,is so unafraid of being itself that I found myself enamored by it, flaws and all, by the middle of the first episode. It’s one of the only Apple TV Plus shows that I wanted to revisit after watching the first three episodes provided to critics.

As much as this is just a silly kids spinoff, it looks like it’ll probably still be a funny watch for the adults sitting through it, too. All of Disney+ premieres November 12th.,The final trailer for , doesn’t go too deep into the movie — it’s really just a highlight reel of all the great reviews the film has gotten. There’s a big cast, a simple premise, and a writer/director who loves toying with genre conventions, so this ought to be fun. The film comes out November 27th.,On one hand, this looks like a really straightforward rom-com. On the other, it’s beautifully shot and looks like it brings a depth to the formula by folding in the complexities of not knowing one’s family history. Plus, it stars Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield. Obviously, this one’s coming out on Valentine’s Day.,I love that this candy-colored film is actually covering up a very eerie sci-fi story. It centers around scientists developing a plant with pollen that appears to have a mood-lifting effect, to eventually problematic results. It comes out December 6th.,Here’s all I care about: the grumpy dude is voiced by Michael Douglas. The show starts November 8th."

That’s why HBO’s , something the company rolled out earlier this year, is getting a big lift on ,. Celebrities will now have pages where they can list their own recommendations. HBO Max customers can then use those recommendation pages to select a movie or TV show directly from that celebrity’s profile. ,A new function, called “highlight,” is designed to help people not have to worry about scrolling through an app to choose something to watch. Users spend about nine minutes just scrolling through options, and HBO Max is designed to cut through that. Highlights, as seen in the photo below, are curated and packaged together to offer subscribers more specific choices.

Apple TV Plus is basically free because Apple’s end game is replicating Amazon Prime,"

        ",Julia Alexander,"Apple CEO Tim Cook offered a simple answer when investors asked why the company decided to essentially give away its upcoming streaming service, ,, for next to nothing: it’s a “gift to our users.”,“We’re really proud of the content,” Cook told investors ,. “We’d like as many people as possible to view it. And so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going.”,Apple TV Plus ,, but anyone who purchases a new or refurbished piece of Apple hardware will get a free one-year subscription.

Maximizing subscribers is important to the company and to investors who are eager to figure out Apple’s strategy. ,This is a new space for the company, one it’s been trying to crack for years.

Customers pay for Amazon Prime Video; they just get it through Amazon Prime. They also get Amazon Music and one free Twitch Prime subscription every month. Apple wants to replicate Amazon’s success by using its big advantage: hardware. Once customers are reliant on Apple’s apps, upgrading to a new iPhone or MacBook makes even more sense. ,People are still spending money.

A classic Mary Tyler Moore Show episode mirrors Apple TV Plus’ Morning Show series,"

Over the course of seven seasons, the groundbreaking sitcom followed Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), an unmarried career woman working as a broadcast news producer at a Minneapolis TV station where the demands of the job regularly interfered with her personal life. In “Assistant Wanted, Female,” Mary’s boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner) allows her to hire some help, and she takes a chance on her snobbish, conceited neighbor Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman) who has a hard time taking orders from someone she considers her inferior.,Because , debuts on Apple TV Plus today.,Consumers will be inundated with new subscription streaming services over the next six months, with ,, ,, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock all launching soon, offering original programming alongside an impressive back catalog of classic television and movies. Apple TV Plus will be one of the least expensive of the streaming market’s major players, though, without a Disney- or HBO-like archive of highly valued older content, the company intends to lure subscribers solely with its own products. The service arrives today with a small handful of TV series in a variety of genres, from period dramas to kids’ shows.,The centerpiece of the Apple TV Plus first wave is ,. The backstage melodrama stars Jennifer Aniston as a veteran network TV news anchor who fights for her job and tussles with a new rival (Reese Witherspoon) when her longtime co-host (Steve Carell) is fired for sexual misconduct. The star-studded series (which also features Billy Crudup, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mark Duplass, and Bel Powley as well as guest appearances from Mindy Kaling and Martin Short) tackles the same fragmented, rocky modern media landscape that led to the creation of Apple TV Plus in the first place. It also deals with how women are treated in show business in the #MeToo era., is hardly the first series to find drama and humor in the evolving roles for women in media. Beginning in 1970, , built a devoted audience with its sophisticated, funny take on the everyday grind of turning out a local news telecast — and with its depiction of the toll the job takes on one independent woman. Mary Richards had her share of romantic subplots during the run of the show, but the writers (including Silverman, one of the few women in the room) were far more interested in her friendships and in how she navigated a stressful, fast-paced workplace., was especially good at contrasting Mary with the other women in her life. “Assistant Wanted, Female” opens with her sharing breakfast with her best pal Rhoda, a wisecracking cynic, stressing out about her diet. (“Just a 70-calorie hard-boiled egg for ol’ tubbo,” Rhoda says of herself, before giving in to temptation and having toast with jam.) Both of them bristle at Phyllis, who swoops into Mary’s apartment looking well-dressed and perfectly coiffed, boasting about “being a model wife and a perfect mother.” (“She’s going to give overbearing, aggressive women a bad name,” Rhoda gripes.) As Mary strives to be taken seriously at work, she sees reflections of herself in her two friends: the one who gets on everyone’s nerves because she tries too hard and the one who stays primed for disappointment by treating everything as a joke.,Anyone interested in tracking the transitions women have experienced in the workplace, and in media, in particular.,“Assistant Wanted, Female” arrived early in ,’s run when Mary was still trying to find her bearings at the fictional Minneapolis station WJM. Without making a big point of it, the episode exposes the gendered power imbalance in the newsroom where Mary is expected to work through lunch, covering the phones and doing the filing, while news anchor Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) takes a long nap after a two-hour Mexican feast.,Most of the humor here comes from the way Mary manages two competing egos as she runs interference between the evening news’s sour, unsentimental producer Lou and the above-it-all Phyllis. Because she takes this job mostly as a lark, Phyllis has a lackadaisical attitude toward her clerical assignments and working hours. When Mary chastises her for embarrassing her in front of Mr. Grant, Phyllis assumes her friend is just jealous and wonders if she should’ve dressed more “dowdy,” so as not to overshadow Mary. Like the best of ,, “Assistant Wanted, Female” is snappy, with a keenly nuanced sense of how bad habits and unfair presumptions have way too much to do with how the world really works.,Hulu.

"New trailers: Bad Boys For Life, Pixar’s Soul, Wendy, and more","
          Nov  9, 2019, 10:00am EST
        ",Jacob Kastrenakes," wrapped up a couple weeks ago with one of the all-time weirdest final episodes. Part of me loves it: the show jumped decades into the future to show just how much New York has changed, which has really been the story of the show all along. It also felt like fan service, letting people see how these characters and events turned out down the road.,Jumping from a very stylized 1970s / 80s to a sort of stylized 2019 is extremely weird, though. It’s like seeing a character from a Western pop up on a space ship — just completely and utterly out of place.,I’m sure that was part of the point, but combined with James Franco in old man makeup, the whole thing felt uproariously goofy. , has always tried to be so much bigger than it can handle (e.g. the final episode’s emotional climax took place during a surprise wedding for a couple who are at best tertiary characters), and jumping ahead to the present day was kind of the ultimate demonstration of that.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,I think motorcycle chases are probably just inherently cooler than car chases because the vehicles are more nimble and you can see the rider. At least, that is my takeaway from the end of this trailer, where there are a bunch of motorcycles and one definitely blows up. The movie comes out January 17th.,Oh no, this trailer is only a minute long and I’m already borderline crying. Point being, Pixar’s latest looks like it’s going to be good. It comes out next year on June 19th., is the first film from director Benh Zeitlin since ,, and the two movies seem to share a lot of wonderful things in common. This reimagining of , from Wendy’s perspective looks utterly magical and charming. It comes out February 28th.,With Apple TV Plus live and the first set of shows available, Apple is now starting to preview what comes next. One of those is as trailer for a series from M. Night Shyamalan about a fake baby, or a creepy nanny, or... some combination of very eerie-looking things. It comes out November 28th.,Apple is also getting a film starring Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie about two men in 1950s California who buy a bank to help black residents get homes in white neighborhoods. It’s based on a real story — and prosecution — and comes out December 6th.,Of the three Apple TV Plus trailers this week, , is absolutely the standout. It’s about a Pakistani American teenager figuring out how to straddle two worlds — the adventures of high school, and the locked-down world of overprotective parents. It comes out December 6th.,Having not seen ,, I am truly confused by what to expect from ,. But I like that John Malkovich is in it, I like that there are neon lights, and I like that there appears to be a pope showdown in the cards. The season starts in January.,Okay, it has happened twice now that Netflix and HBO released trailers for their upcoming pope titles during the same week. Both involve two popes. Both somehow look really good. But like, what? How is this happening? This one comes out December 20th.,It’s been far too long since we got a bonkers Nic Cage movie, but thankfully , has come along. Just gonna quote Nic here: “Then everything just blew up. Big flash. Like a pink light. Or actually, I don’t even know what color it was. It wasn’t like any color I’d ever seen before.”"

The Mandalorian’s first episode shows that Star Wars can work on the small screen,"
          Nov 12, 2019, 10:03am EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg," has always been heavily inspired by classic Westerns. But that’s never been quite as overt as it is in ,, the first live-action TV series for the franchise and the marquee title for the brand-new , streaming service. Outside of a few animated TV shows aimed at kids, , has largely been a brand that has thrived on the big screen — the original films practically invented the modern concept of a summer blockbuster — but can it make the jump to a prestige TV drama?,With just a single episode out, it’s hard to say whether Disney has succeeded, but one thing is clear: , is off to a great start, and it’s perhaps the best proof yet that the , universe can lead to compelling content that isn’t packaged for kids or reliant on Luke Skywalker showing up. ,The first episode does a lot of heavy lifting to acclimate viewers to a part of the , universe that feels both familiar and new. There’s the eponymous Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), a bounty hunter not unlike the fan-favorite Boba Fett from the films. The Mandalorian is largely a blank slate; he’s mostly silent, always masked, but very good at what he does: hunting down and sometimes killing bail-jumpers and smugglers for money.,We get a crash course in how the bounty-hunting system works, complete with the Bounty Hunters Guild — a long-standing , concept — taken extremely literally as an actual unionized workforce of bounty hunters. There are labor disputes over clients refusing to pay guild rates. It is possibly the most relatable thing to occur in the episode. We also get a hint at the current state of the galaxy following the destruction of the second Death Star and the downfall of the Empire. It seems Imperial credits aren’t in demand, these days. ,There are very few overt references to the films so far. Unlike , and , (the first wave of spinoff films, which could, at times, feel smothering in their desire to explain and reference the main saga), , feels more like its own thing. There are plenty of , trappings, of course — droids and Stormtroopers and people frozen in carbonite abound — but the show feels less reliant on name-dropping events and fan service-y cameos than past elements. The heavily Western mood does suggest that Disney is learning from its blockbuster Marvel franchise, which has seen massive success by dropping the MCU formula and characters into different genres. Much like how , is designed in the vein of classic spy films or the , films are modeled after superheroic heists, , wears its influences proudly. It’s possible that this will change and the ghost of Darth Vader will show up in episode 3, flying the Millennium Falcon with Luke Skywalker. But for now, the show seems far more comfortable existing on its own than previous titles.,We also get the basic setup for the rest of the series. After a successful run of smaller bounty-hunting gigs, Carl Weathers’ Greef Carga, the local guild representative, puts the Mandalorian in touch with a mysterious client (Werner Herzog’s unnamed but clearly Empire-affiliated villain) who offers a far more difficult bounty on behalf of his associate, Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi). The reward? ,, or Mandalorian iron, an incredibly rare substance that’s used to make true Mandalorian armor, which can famously deflect blasters and even lightsaber attacks. It should go without saying that things do not go smoothly. ,Unlike , heroes past, including Harrison Ford’s charming Han Solo, Pedro Pascal’s Mandalorian is more of a quiet lone gunslinger in the vein of Clint Eastwood, speaking only when he needs to. There’s not a ton of depth, although there’s a clear establishment of the “heart of gold” trope, despite his grim profession. (At one point, he donates a portion of his earnings to support orphans.) There’s also a requisite tragic backstory that will no doubt be explored in future episodes. Pascal does good work, despite the restrictions of the masked role, playing the part with cool efficiency.,The show looks fantastic; Disney clearly spared no expense. Everything from the CGI for the spaceships and blasters to the elaborate sets and costumes feels right at home with the giant blockbusters that have made up the franchise so far. ,The big question remains whether , can keep up this momentum for the rest of the season and beyond. (The series has already been renewed for a second season.) The first season’s eight episodes are almost as long as an entire ,trilogy of movies, making the show one of the largest chunks of the constantly evolving live-action , canon.,Combined with the lackluster reception of previous spinoff attempts no doubt weighing heavily on Disney’s mind along with the upcoming end of the more reliable Skywalker Saga films with ,which is due out in December, , has to be more than just a good show. It has to carry the entire , franchise forward while also providing a reason for millions of people to pay a monthly price for Disney+.,The closest comparison I can think of is 2017’s ,, which similarly had to carry a long-rushing sci-fi franchise into a new era while serving as the main incentive to subscribe to an otherwise back catalog-heavy streaming service. Two years later, it’s safe to say that,’s experiment was a success on those counts. CBS All Access is still going strong, and the brand has been revitalized with a bevy of new shows and spinoffs in the works. , may not be the next ,and Disney+ may not succeed as a service. But what’s here so far is a good , TV show, one that takes the existing lore and setting and expands it in a new and exciting way. For now, that’s more than enough of a reason to watch."
Disney+ will fix The Simpsons’ joke-destroying 16:9 aspect ratio starting in 2020 ,"
          Nov 15, 2019,  7:07pm EST
        ",Jay Peters,"With the launch of Disney+ this week, many fans were excited to have easy access to all 30 seasons of , — only to find , that their original 4:3 aspect ratio had been discarded for a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, cropping out many visual gags entirely. But now, Disney says that it will be fixing this in “early 2020” by making an additional version of the first 19 seasons in 4:3, the way they were intended to be viewed.,Here’s Disney’s statement: ,To give you an idea of what you might be missing with the widescreen format, here’s an example:,Why 19 seasons, instead of all 30? From 2009 on, partway through ,s,20th season, the show had already switched to the 16:9 aspect ratio — so those episodes should be fine already."
"New trailers: Sonic the Hedgehog, Harley Quinn, The Invisible Man, and more","
          Nov 16, 2019, 10:00am EST
        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"I watched , a few weeks ago now that it’s finally streaming. The first one was an unexpectedly smart and hilarious take on what a Lego story can be, and this second one does a good job of keeping up the momentum. The film is funny, and it still grounds the whole thing in a story about family and growing up.,That said, I do think there’s an odd tension within the movie. The sequel wants to tell a story about toxic masculinity and supporting traditionally feminine interests, but to do that, it kind of makes a joke of them first. Likewise, the film acknowledges related issues like how the original movie played into the trope about an incompetent man becoming the hero thanks to guidance from a fully competent woman... but then immediately follows that up by having the incompetent man have to rescue said woman once again.,In the end, I love where the sequel lands and how many surprising topics it touches in the process (flipping around “Everything is Awesome,” for instance). But I can’t help but wonder how else this same story could have been told, given a perspective that just flat-out supports its female characters from the start.,Check out seven trailers from this week (okay, one is from last week) below.,Studios have to contend with a lot of fan backlash, often for the wrong reasons. But this is one of the instances where the studio was truly out of touch — the original Sonic design was, without question, off-putting and bizarre. This week, we finally got a look at the redesigned character, and hey, it looks like Sonic! Now we just have to deal with the rest of the film. It comes out on, um, Valentine’s Day?,DC is making a Harley Quinn show for its DC Universe streaming service. The first few seconds of this trailer are a boring reminder that Batman and other famous characters are going to show up, but after that the trailer gives a much better sense of how this character is being updated for 2019, with, for instance, a very unexpected yet responsible HPV joke from Bane. The show comes out November 29th.,I missed this one last week. , was originally supposed to be part of Universal’s obviously doomed “Dark Universe” of interconnected classic monster movies, but the studio scaled that effort way back after a series of flops. That’s led , to a less flashy and likely better place, with the movie becoming something of a psychological horror film about abuse and failure to believe women, with Elisabeth Moss as the star. (Though it looks very bloody and filled with over-the-top fight scenes, too.) The movie comes out February 28th.,Jennifer Reeder’s new film is filled with a surprising amount of bright colors and friendly shapes for what’s actually a dark thriller under the surface. The film has been getting positive reviews out of festivals, and it comes out on December 6th. ,I will admit that, on its own, this trailer is not that engaging — even if it does have some great imagery in it. What makes this worth checking out is this: if you check the IMDb page for ,, you’ll only find a single name: Gints Zilbalodis, who wrote, directed, edited, scored, and so on, the entire movie. It comes out November 29th.,If you’ve ever taken a film course or spent time around people who talk about the Criterion Collection, you’ve probably seen ,, and you can probably recognize Jean Seberg. I had no idea that beyond her film career, she became a civil rights activist targeted by the FBI for her support of the Black Panthers. It’s a fascinating story, though I do hope this film contends with the fact that it makes a white woman the focus of a piece set within a black revolutionary movement. It comes out December 13th.,This movie is directed by Michael Bay. And all I can really say is: ............what on earth?"
The best streaming shows and movies to binge-watch this Thanksgiving ,"
          Nov 27, 2019,  9:00am EST
        ",Verge Staff,"Thanksgiving is almost here, and nothing goes quite as well with a weekend off from work and eating huge amounts of food like hours spent digesting on the couch, binge-watching movies and TV shows. ,Unfortunately, given the massive amount of content available on the myriad streaming platforms, actually , something that everyone can agree on to watch can be as miserable as whenever someone brings up politics during Thanksgiving dinner. Here are our suggestions to help make your holiday streaming go smoothly. ,The Princess Bride is a classic adventure movie with something for everyone: “Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles…” Think family comedy, but with one of the greatest fencing scenes ever filmed. My huge extended family used to rewatch , every single year after Thanksgiving dinner — probably the one thing everyone could agree on — and it only gets better with repeat viewing. Though as a result, I believed Rodents of Unusual Size (ROUS) were nesting in my childhood closet and refused to sleep with the door open. ,: Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, or Vudu., Your kids, who will definitely not have nightmares about the ROUS.,: Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, or Vudu.,: That one insufferable uncle who says that , is the only good Christmas movie.,In case you haven’t heard, there’s a new , movie coming out in less than a month. What better way to prepare than watching Episodes 1 through 8 in a giant marathon? (Throw in the first few episodes of ,, too, while you’re already logged into Disney+). Plus, , movies are the ultimate crowd pleaser — uncontroversial tales of good and evil with epic lightsaber and space duels that should entertain the entire family without too much of a fight over what to watch. ,: Disney+, Netflix (for ,), The , fan in your life who won’t stop talking about ,.,didn’t get the audience it deserved when it first came out, and A.O. Scott, , movie critic, panned it: “It’s just a movie with no particular reason for existing,” ,. Well, no movie has any reason to exist at all, if you want to get existential about it, and ,is a sun-drenched noir that just wants you to have a good time.,Here are three reasons you should watch this movie: Robert Downey Jr.’s performance, Michelle Monaghan’s performance, and , Val Kilmer’s performance. Downey plays Harry Lockhart, a small-time New York criminal who’s mistaken for an actor while he’s running from the cops and flown to Los Angeles for a movie role. There he meets Kilmer’s Perry, a private eye who Harry shadows to help prepare for his role. Perry insists being a PI is boring, and that’s when the bodies start turning up.,As Harry and Perry try to get to the bottom of things without getting killed themselves, Harry runs into his childhood crush, Harmony, a failing actress with a thing for detective novels. The rest of the plot is an homage to the noir genre, hitting every major cliché along the way with self-aware glee. Every gun that is placed on the mantelpiece goes off by the end, while Kilmer, Downey, and Monaghan swap witty one-liners. It’s a buddy comedy for people who’ve seen every buddy comedy, a noir for Raymond Chandler aficionados, a slightly bitchy love letter to Hollywood, and a career-best performance from Kilmer. , is fast and funny — and pretty much endlessly rewatchable, so after you join its little cult, you can press it on all your friends. ,: Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, or Vudu., Fans of ,and ,Also, any English teachers, writers, failed writers, editors, or copy editors you may know: there is a recurring joke about adverb usage that they will , appreciate.,If you’re thinking, “Hey, my family and I need a movie that will make us want to eat even more food than what we’ve already consumed,” then this is the movie for you! Chef is a fun and lighthearted movie with a great cast, starring Jon Favreau, Scarlett Johansson, Sofia Vergara, Robert Downey Jr., and more. After quitting his job at a high-end restaurant in Los Angeles, Chef Carl Casper decides to launch a food truck with his best friend, ex-wife, and son. My mom and I watched this last Thanksgiving actually and I think we’ll probably watch it again because it was that good. Just make sure you have snacks nearby or else you’ll be pausing the movie multiple times like we did, to run to the kitchen for leftovers. ,: Amazon Prime Video,Basically anyone who’s eating those leftovers,There are two reasons to watch , over Thanksgiving. ,1. Because you will probably be seeing , this weekend, and odds are you (or more likely, your child / cousin / niece / nephew / etc. who was too young to remember the story details from the first movie) could use a refresher on what exactly happened in the first movie back in *checks notes* 2013. ,2. Alternatively, if your kids are still younger, just show them this, pretend it’s ,, and save on the movie tickets. ,: Disney+, Smaller relatives that you’ll be taking to the movie theater in a few weeks / days / hours to see ,. ,In a world dominated by the MCU, superhero movies can start to feel very, very ,. One that actually feels different is,, a Marvel-character movie that isn’t actually made by the behemoth of a film studio.,The movie tells a classic superhero origin story to the T, but it deconstructs those familiar beats and uses them to build a hilarious wrapper around a newer character whose story feels less like a parable and more like the experience of someone actually struggling to grow up in New York City (... just with a radioactive spider thrown in).,If for nothing else, the animation alone should be enough for a draw here. , looks like a comic book that’s come alive, and there’s nothing else on-screen quite like it.,Plus, getting everyone to agree to watch Spider-Man should be pretty easy. And ultimately, isn’t avoiding a prolonged argument about what to watch truly something to be thankful for? ,: Netflix, Anyone who appreciates a good Nicolas Cage cameo.,If you’re the kind of person who would rather not be reduced to floods of tears over the holiday, then please feel free to skip ,. Bo Burnham’s directorial debut is a relatively simple story about a girl struggling to get through a year of school. What makes this a great holiday watch is just how painfully relatable her experience is, both for anyone young enough to remember their middle school years, as well as any parents who spent that time desperately trying to support them. ,: Amazon Prime Video,A family member you haven’t hugged in a little while., isn’t technically a Thanksgiving movie, but finding a superhero flick that takes time to celebrate family and hours-long dinners full of laughter and joy is difficult. For one, superheroes don’t really have families. For another, they’re busy. Who has the time? Fortunately, director Shane Black partnered with Marvel Studios and Robert Downey Jr. (who he collaborated with on ,also on this list) to make a superhero Christmas movie.

But what if you want to put on something that will immediately alienate them? What is the movie you can put on that will make everyone slowly vacate the room?,My pick is ,, a slow, haunted sci-fi film that grotesquely ponders existence and intimacy. It’s the kind of pretentious stuff sure to scare the impatient viewer away. Sure, Scarlett Johansson in a fur coat might be a draw. (“Is that the nice girl from ,?” an aunt might ask.) But about five minutes into this movie, your parents and extended relatives will be immediately repulsed by the lack of dialogue, itchy score, bewildering concept, all the swinging flaccid dicks being slowly lowered into black liquid. , Netflix, Nobody, but who knows, maybe that ,-loving aunt might stick around.,French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is best known for the romantic comedy ,. But he’s also the co-director (along with collaborator Marc Caro) of ,: a gorgeous, steampunk-ish fantasy film about a man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams, until he unwisely takes the brother of a circus strongman played by Ron Perlman. There’s a bizarre plot involving child-catching cyborgs, urchin street gangs, and a family of discarded scientific experiments living in an abandoned oil rig.

(And really, what more could you want?),But this Netflix romcom is worth watching because of the elephants. The story takes place in an elephant sanctuary in Zambia, and it showcases the plight of elephant orphans and the terrible poaching problem that elephants face in parts of Africa. There are also , of cute baby elephants (and a trunk hug scene)! ,: Netflix,: Elephant and/or Rob Lowe enthusiasts,This is the Marx Brothers’ funniest and most chaotically satirical movie, and a great introduction for anyone new to their films. Groucho plays the happily corrupt leader of a fictional nation who starts a war just because he feels insulted by a rival; Chico and Harpo are his equally self-interested spies. But actually, the plot doesn’t really matter — like all their movies, this is basically a series of comedy skits. The adults will like the satire and wordplay, the kids will like the knockabout physical comedy (assuming they can handle the lack of color in this 1933 film). ,: Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, or Vudu., Anyone who has been spending too much time paying attention to the news., is TV’s answer to “what if ,, but horny?,” a thoroughly modern take on adult onset ennui sprinkled with sex, spells, and snarky fantasy creatures. It’s rare that I’ll argue a show is better than any book, but SyFy’s adaptation of Lev Grossman’s magical trilogy is the exception. , may start as another cliche tale about a white guy who finds out he’s special, but it evolves into something much more, tackling topics like depression, sexual violence, and queer identity.

What more could you want? ,: Netflix,h: Your relatives who only use , references to talk about politics., is a good show. It’s been running for a very long time, probably because it is just that: a good show. ,: Netflix, Anyone except the weird cousins who spent too many years competing on their middle school Quiz Bowl team. ,The adaptation of the beloved Terry Pratchett / Neil Gaiman novel about an angel and a demon teaming up to try to prevent Armageddon finally made its way to TV with an Amazon Prime miniseries this year. It’s quirky and optimistic and very British, and is more or less the television equivalent of a cozy blanket and a mug of a hot chocolate (except for the whole “end of the world” bit). ,The key is the casting of Michael Sheen and David Tennant, perfectly cast as the angel / devil duo with a love-hate relationship that spans several millennia. Plus, the six-episode miniseries is the perfect length to binge over the holiday weekend. ,: Amazon Prime, Fans of the book, relatives who aren’t overly offended by alternative takes on religious content.  ,If you want to watch the realest reality show, it’s ,. The entire premise: six Japanese young adults, three men and three women, live together in a beautiful Japanese home. That’s it. From there, the messiness of life takes over and you get to see some real drama. A lot of watching the show is to speculate who will date who, but that will lead to endless discussions with your family (if you can pull yourself away from watching just one more episode). And the best parts of the show are the six , cast members who, throughout each episode, get airtime to comment and banter about the same exact episode you’re watching. They almost become your second family. Netflix has already released the first twelve episodes of the show’s newest season, and the next batch comes out on December 24th, so Thanksgiving break gives you plenty of time to catch up.  ,: Netflix,: Your other millennial family members who, despite all being older than 21, are still shunted to the kids table.,Colloquially referred to as “knife psycho” in my apartment, this Japanese YouTuber makes knives that are amazingly well crafted out of increasingly stranger materials. However, there is a strange malice that haunts these videos, which are shot less like a relaxing crafting video and more like a horror film. You will ask why he would make a knife out of fungi, or what his fascination with cow-shaped creamers is, or what would compel someone to make a ring out of human fingernails? But he never speaks, so you will never know. You can only watch it unfold and scream your questions uselessly at the screen. Unanswered, you will watch the next video in hopes of gleaning some understanding, but it will never come. ,: , Those wishing to distract themselves and their family from familial interactions with existential dread.,This show is not good — it’s fantastic. Taking place years after the original , movie, Danny (the original hero) is a successful businessman owning multiple car dealerships, while the once-villainous Johnny is a burnout just living day to day until he reopens the Cobra Kai dojo and enrolls a few misfit kids.,Going into ,, you’d expect a story with a lot of black-and-white morality, but what you actually get is a complex tale that interweaves morality, community, and remixes a ton of what made the original great. No one is all good, and no one is all bad, and best of all: there are plenty of cars to wax. ,: , Basically anyone in your family. It’ll appeal to anyone who’s seen the original movie, but you don’t need to have seen it to enjoy.,It’s Thanksgiving. There is NFL football. There is NCAA football. Just watch the football. ,: Well, that depends. If you have a TV antenna or cable, you’re best off using that. Alternatively, try to “borrow” a cable login from one of your visiting relatives if they pay for terrestrial television. You can also sign up for an over-the-top streaming service that gets you CBS / NBC / Fox. Or just admit defeat and sign up for NFL Sunday Ticket, but be aware that there may be blackouts based on geography. ,Honestly, streaming football is still painfully complicated in 2019. , Football is for everyone.

The Expanse season 4 settles down for an anti-colonial disaster ,"
          Dec  4, 2019, 12:59pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"A year ago, , was canceled. , arrived while its third season was airing on SyFy, the reported rationale being that the rights agreement between its production company and its host network was not terribly profitable for the latter. In about two weeks, the show was saved by Amazon, an announcement made ,. If pure entertainment is your concern, this was good news: ,is one of the most dense and rewarding science fiction shows in recent memory, and at the time only one-third of the way through a nine-novel adaptation. Now it could continue, at the small cost of giving the world’s richest man a little bit more of your money and attention. ,Despite its high-profile new home, , is very much the same show. Its fourth season, set to premiere on December 13th, picks up immediately after the events of the third season finale — which in turn was the slow-burn culmination that began with a missing girl and ended with the discovery of alien life and other worlds. ,Season 4 pumps the brakes a bit to rearrange the show’s sprawling array of characters and places. The action centers around Ilus, a new, seemingly unpopulated world found beyond a newly opened gate to other star systems. Collectively, humanity is struggling to deal with the sudden revelation of new, habitable worlds, and ultimately dealing with it poorly. The first three seasons of ,are largely concerned with how class structures and oppressive politics replicate themselves, even in the far reaches of space. ,There’s a land rush. The RCE, an energy company with a contract to mine Ilus — dubbed “New Terra” by some — dispatches a research team. But their mission is complicated by refugees from the Asteroid Belt station Ganymede, who, with nowhere else to go, run a blockade to quickly claim land as their own. Knowing that this will likely end poorly, United Nations chief Chrisjen Avasarala (Shohreh Aghdashloo) dispatches the crew of the gunship Rocinante to arbitrate. Captain James Holden (Steven Strait) and his crew once again find themselves in the middle of a conflict that threatens to become the epicenter of something much larger — especially when it seems like the planet itself might be alive.,In the six episodes released in advance to critics, the new season of , feels like the beginning of a grand second act. The first three seasons of the show were driven by the slow realization of scale, as one mystery gradually unraveled into the increasing certainty of open, deadly war. With the pathway to other worlds open, the tensions between the various factions of , are dialed down as the show digs in for a story about the ugly, messy greed of colonization. ,Fans of , will see a lot in common with that show’s third season, where colonization of a barren planet served as a crucible for its characters and a swing-for-the-fences attempt to make its themes about hostile occupation and resistance , clear. , has less of a handle on what it’s trying to do on Ilus / New Terra, partly because it operates on such a large scale, and it takes a long time to show how the effects of its now-larger universe begin to spiral outward. ,At its best, , uses its new status quo to drive its characters into making a lot of bad calls. Holden and the Rocinante,crew are meddling in the affairs of other meddlers, and all of them are acting in response to the actions and decisions of those in power. At the heart of it all are the fundamental hubris of colonization, the entitlement that makes people believe they can take whatever unclaimed land they find, and the desperation that forces the oppressed to make a similar gambit. While it’s possible for some characters to consider their actions noble in the moment, over time it gets harder to call what they’re doing ,.,One of the things that makes ,such compelling television is the way it makes space tangibly dangerous. Whenever the show leaves Earth, neither the viewer nor the characters are ever unaware of the razor’s edge they stand on every second they remain alive. That tension radiates outward to the political landscape of the show: the power plays and backstabbing and spurned populaces with chips on their shoulder gradually ratchet up the pressure on an already fragile stability. You watch the show and wonder if it’s all going to hold together just a little bit longer, and if it even deserves to. "

Truth Be Told doesn’t know how to make a murderer,"
          Dec  6, 2019,  4:56pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"should be a home run. Its premise — the story of a podcaster revisiting a murder case 20 years after a suspect has been incarcerated — immediately evokes ,The pilot, which showcases what appears to be a coerced minor’s testimony, might as well mention ,by name. These are popular, compelling true crime stories, and ,is out to recreate the thrills of the genre through fiction. , is the latest original series from Apple TV Plus. Poppy Parnell (Octavia Spencer) is a true crime podcaster returning to the case of Warren Cave (Aaron Paul), a man convicted of murdering his neighbor when he was a teenager. Poppy has reason to believe that Warren might be innocent, but she’s also got some skin in the game — it was her reporting that led to Warren’s conviction 20 years ago, a series of stories that made her career. “Doesn’t that mean it’s just a crime story?”,you might ask, and you know what? You’d be right! It’s a crime story, with the reportorial inflection of your favorite nonfiction podcast. I wouldn’t think about it too much, because ,does not. It’d be much nicer if it did. ,Almost immediately, there’s a dissonance between the facts as the show lays them out, and how it considers them. Most glaring is Poppy’s portrayal as directly responsible for Warren’s incarceration, thanks to her reporting — which means she has a stake in this story that wouldn’t pass a journalism sniff test in a million years — but , make for a compelling thriller as Poppy gets more wrapped up in a story she’s far too close to. (Though if Poppy’s reporting helped land Warren in prison and he’s actually innocent, that means,),Unfortunately, , isn’t terribly interested in these ideas, painting the podcast instead as Poppy’s crusade to clear a man who might be innocent. This makes her seem like a completely self-interested jerk instead of the brave reporter the show needs her to be. , instead supplements its central mystery with Poppy’s increasingly complicated family life. Her career as a podcast icon has also lifted her comfortably into the middle class, something that’s making it harder and harder to connect with her less fortunate family. There’s rich drama to mine there, but, like the Cave case, it’s all hamstrung by the show’s perplexing disinterest in making Poppy out as anything other than a hero. ,This bleeds over to ,’s plotting, which doles out twists in its murder mystery as Poppy is about to discover them for herself. There’s very little tension, and that compulsive ‘can’t wait to learn what happens next’ feeling you get from true crime stories in the ,mold is completely missing here. ,It’s a huge shame, not just because the cast seems to be put to poor use — which, in addition to Spencer and Paul, includes Lizzy Caplan and Ron Cephas Jones, all giving perplexingly muted performances — but because , assembles a well-rounded cast of black characters from all walks of life, the main exception being everyone tied to the Cave case. It’s a nice diversion from the overwhelmingly white world of popular true crime podcasts, and one the show does matter-of-factly. ,This hurts the show, both depriving it of desperately needed depth and giving inadvertent absolution , of modern true crime. “In a way, crime stories, true or otherwise, have always been about self-soothing,” writes Andrea DenHoed for , in ,. “It’s a genre whose satisfactions derive largely from the finality of the big reveal, and it’s not, consequently, particularly well equipped to deal with nuance, contradiction, and ambiguity.”,It is unfair to expect ,to single-handedly improve upon, or even account for, the failings of the storytelling genre in which it has situated itself. It’s okay if the show, in emulating those influences, shares their lack of the nuance, contradiction, and ambiguity that DenHoed describes. Unfortunately, it also lacks the base satisfaction of a true crime podcast, the vicarious thrill and morbid compulsion to keep looking at tragedy, to pry further into somewhere we don’t belong. Perhaps the most damning criticism of ,is a simple one: I don’t care whether Warren Cave killed that man or not."
Runaways finally figures out the show it wants to be — right before it ends ,"
          Dec 13, 2019, 11:37am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera," could’ve been great. The show’s basic premise, about a group of teens who discover that their parents are all supervillains and run away to fight them, is beautifully on the nose. Teenagers rebelling against parents who are actually evil! Also, there are superpowers and a pet dinosaur? If no one else tries it, ,will. ,Unfortunately, ,, Hulu’s TV series based on the Marvel comic created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, stumbled with the execution almost immediately. Its first two seasons were oddly paced and imbalanced, sapping all momentum from the show by decisions that didn’t end up working out so well — first in choosing to slow down the story so that the eponymous Runaways don’t actually, well, run away until the first season finale, and then in choosing to focus on their parents just as much. (Parents are boring, everyone knows that.),In its third and final 10-episode season, out today, ,goes for broke and resets everything — but slowly. The first half of the season is dedicated to tying up the majority of plot threads introduced over the last two years. The second half barrels headfirst into something new: the show it always should have been. ,It’s a lot like watching the show clean up its own act before it goes off to a bright future in college, one episode at a time. The last season left the cast — teen polymath Alex Wilder, power-goth Nico Minoru, reformed jock Chase Stein, dinosaur owner / intersectional feminist Gertrude Yorkes, super-strong kid sister Molly Hayes, and secret alien Karolina Dean — split up and pretty much beat. Their parents, formerly members of an evil cult of alien worshippers, now possessed by the even-more-evil aliens they worshipped, have captured half the team and imprisoned them in a low-budget version of the Matrix. It’s all part of a scheme to open up a portal to another world and, well, you know what? The show doesn’t really care. ,I can’t stress enough how strange and funny it is to watch ,completely change its mind about its direction mid-season, as its cast gets whisked away to another dimension in order to give the show a hard reset. In a way, it’s remarkable. It’s incredibly rare to see a show address and internalize a critical dressing-down and make a hard pivot for the better, but that’s what ,does. ,The parents and their cult-related schemes are almost entirely dispensed with, only brought back when it makes sense. With their reduced presence, the teens actually get to indulge in some teen drama and weird comic-book-y shenanigans involving alternate dimensions, teen covens, and double-crossing. One of the most frustrating character changes, rewriting Nico Minoru’s character from the teen witch of the comics to someone who just owns an alien staff, is completely retconned. She’s a witch now. Magic is now a confirmed thing on the show. ,It’s so much of a thing, in fact, that the final villain of the season is Morgan le Fay, the sorceress of Arthurian legend (and also a Marvel comics character). Also making appearances are Ty Johnson and Tandy Bowen, the light- and darkness-powered heroes of Marvel’s other doomed-too-soon teen show on Freeform, ,. , final season is a bittersweet watch. For years, the comic it was based on was one of the best points of entry for comic books, more interested in believable characters and fun pacing than any of the normal trappings of superheroics. Its TV adaptation could have been just as refreshing, but too often, it looked like a pale, confused imitation. ,At the very least, it gets to go out with a bang."

Crisis On Infinite Earths is the most comic book thing ever made for TV,"
          Dec 11, 2019,  1:54pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Going to the theater now feels like going to a comic book shop. You can usually pick between Marvel or DC at the box office every summer. This extends to TV and streaming — it’s possible to have an entertainment diet made entirely of superhero media and still not get to it all. (Trust me, I’ve tried.) Despite this pervasiveness, we tend to mostly talk about the big-budget film stuff. The MCU and everything you need to keep up with it. It can, frankly, feel like work — but there are still places where keeping up with superheroes is what it should be: goofy, nonsensical fun.,One of the strangest successes in superhero comics’ march across pop culture has been what’s known as the ,-verse: The CW’s sprawling universe of connected DC superhero shows that all spun out of the Big Bang that is ,, a 2012 reimagining of the vigilante Green Arrow through the lens (and the budget) of a CW soap. Seven years later, that small-screen universe is reaching what looks like the apex of its existence: ,, a five-part miniseries adapting one of the most seminal comic book crossovers of all time. , (the show) is an audacious piece of television. Three of its five episodes have aired over the last three nights and are streaming now on the CW app, with the final two parts airing back to back after the holidays, on January 14th. It’s equal parts , and pro wrestling, a love letter to superfans, and everything garish and off-putting to the uninitiated. Entire scenes are dedicated to obscure cameos, characters are introduced with very little explanation and dispatched with even less. It’s all very silly and also remarkable; the rare TV event parseable solely to fans who have followed a half-dozen shows for seven years, by design., (the comic) was an equally audacious endeavor, albeit one with the opposite motive. The fictional histories of DC superheroes were getting too complicated, too contradictory. The solution, then, was to end it all, casting every story ever told in a DC comic across a wide multiverse, and then bringing that multiverse to an end. The comic book , was an act of consolidation, letting the editors, writers, and artists of ‘80s DC decide what they liked and what they did not from the previous fifty years of stories so they could start again. ,On TV, it plays out far less neatly: Following teases that began with last year’s , crossover, a long-gestating cataclysm is finally here. Parallel Earths are being wiped out of existence one at a time, and now the heroes of Earth-1 (the ,-verse, including but not limited to: Oliver Queen / Green Arrow; Barry Allen / The Flash; Kara Danvers / Supergirl; and Kate Kane / Batwoman) must hop from one universe to the next in order to find “Paragons” who will defeat the Anti-Monitor, the cosmic villain who began the eponymous Crisis. ,The whole thing barely makes a lick of sense, with far too many plot threads to possibly wrap up in a satisfying way. Mostly, it’s a joyride through the DC universe, paying homage to every possible iteration it can. Burt Ward, the Robin of the ‘66 ,TV series, has a cameo set on the Earth of that show, as does Robert Wuhl, who played reporter Alexander Knox in Tim Burton’s ,. Stick around for a while and you’ll be treated to scenes with Tom Welling, the Clark Kent of ,; Kevin Conroy, the voice of the ‘90s animated Batman; and Brandon Routh, reprising his role as the , of the Richard Donner / Bryan Singer films. (Routh also plays Ray Palmer / The Atom in ,; , is not afraid to double dip.),An easy comparison would be ,, that this is a cornier, small-screen version of , /,. And yes, there are superficial similarities, with all the people getting dusted and the overtures toward bidding farewell to Oliver Queen and ,, the show that started it all. But the unabashed earnestness of it all — the conviction with which garish costumes are worn, nerdy jokes are delivered, and lo-fi recreations of famous comic panels are staged — it’s got a cheesy heart you can’t buy with any amount of money. , isn’t going to do a whole lot for anyone who hasn’t kept up with the ,-verse — you don’t have to be caught up on everything to know what’s going on, but you do have to know enough to fake your way through a conversation at Comic-Con. But at a brisk three episodes, it’s also worth seeing for sheer spectacle. Even with superheroes everywhere, there’s nothing remotely as comic book as this out there, and I doubt we’ll get something quite like it again."

(I’m sorry, I couldn’t post another , trailer). I got to watch a few things during the break though, with the biggest being ,.,There’s something incredible about indie filmmaking styles now being so mainstream that a major comic book movie is able to emulate them. All of , feels this way to an extent, but the clearest moments are the occasional sequences that have the camera floating close beside a silent, emotional Joaquin Phoenix, in the oddest of homages to Terrence Malick. I love how the filmmakers are trying to apply that vibe here, but it’s just way too hard to make that kind of emotional intimacy work with a character who, ultimately, is a clear-cut murderous villain. It makes for a lot of mixed tones and messages that the movie can’t quite line up, and frankly, probably shouldn’t.,One thing I will say I enjoyed is the movie’s (,) music selection during the stairs sequence. The juxtaposition of a song so clearly associated with riling up crowds in sports stadiums with the seriousness of the film and the absurdity of the Joker suddenly becoming the Joker is just... perfect. I don’t think I’ve ever been so pleased by a musical cue.,Check out seven trailers from this week below... and since I left you all hanging the last two weeks, I’ve got a few bonus trailers below those that are from late November.,At long last, Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow is getting her own film. One of the wonderful things about the MCU is how willing the studio is to let individual films dive deep into different genres, and , really feels like a straight-up spy thriller. I mean, with some over-the-top, Marvel-scale action sequences too. But also with some intimate fights and drama.

Not so much. , is his final chance, and there are some big names on board to help out — Cary Joji Fukunaga directs, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge helped polish the script.

This trailer is actually shorter than the first trailer that came out, but I think it does a much better job of just letting the movie play so that we can see how strong these performances are and why they’ll be worth watching. The film comes out on Christmas and expands wide on January 10th.,Awkwafina has very quickly become a must-see, hilarious on-screen presence, so it was only a matter of time before she got her own TV show. , (as I learned writing this: her name is Nora, and she is from Queens) looks like exactly the scrappy comedy show you’d want from her.

We get to see multiple sides of these characters as they struggle with growing up and figuring out what they want. It’s never so simple as them learning to do the right thing — we often see them making tough and surprising choices as their goals shift over time.,Coming from Greta Gerwig, the film obviously does incredible things with Jo’s journey as a writer.

The new season starts January 19th.,I didn’t include an earlier trailer for , because the movie seems to be hitting a lot of very familiar horror beats. But you know, it seems to be doing a good job of it, too. The movie looks quiet and creepy, and who doesn’t love seeing a pained Jesse Plemons say something that he obviously knows more about than he’s letting on. The movie comes out April 17th.,I didn’t think this was a real movie when I first started seeing trailers floating around for it, because it just seems so much like a weird little joke Ryan Reynolds would make. But no... this is a movie. A real, complete movie about, basically, an NPC in a video game who becomes a real player, or something like that. The premise is strange and a little nonsensical. The entire thing is weird, really. I’m mostly sharing this out of morbid fascination. It’s coming to theaters? I don’t believe it. Supposedly it’s happening on July 3rd."
"New trailers: Birds of Prey, Locke & Key, The New Mutants, and more","

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"I was excited to watch , the other week for a couple of reasons — for one, there’s been a ton of buzz; but also, it’s one of the only movies I’ve seen in recent years that I haven’t watched the trailer for ahead of time (I happened to be on vacation when it came out, so I didn’t write this weekly column). It was nice getting to go in completely surprised.,The movie does a great job of what it sets out to do — being constantly chaotic and stressful. But I didn’t particularly care for it the way others have. It’s a lot of the same thing: one character making obviously bad and indulgent mistakes, which continually come back to bite him. We know every time what’s going to happen.,What really made it hard for me to get on board with is just how little the movie gives you to connect with. Adam Sandler’s character has no redeeming traits, and it’s not clear why he acts so compulsively bad or what he truly wants to achieve from his constant quest for wealth. It’s just two hours of a bad dude being a bad dude — what’s any of it matter? There’s a comment on materialism in here somewhere, but the film barely bothers to make it.,Check out eight trailers from this week below.,Here’s the trailer for the one and only thing that truly matters in DC film: Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn. At a bare minimum, Robbie ought to make this an entertaining watch, and DC really could have just left it at that. So I’m surprised at how across the board fun this trailer makes , look. Maybe DC can actually pull this one together? It comes out February 7th.,’s journey to TV has been infamous. The comic has repeatedly been picked up as an adaptation only to be dropped before making it to series, so I was stunned to see that Netflix had a trailer this week — I just assumed that somewhere along the line, things would fall apart again. The show is nearly here, and it looks like a fun teen adventure. The series comes out February 7th.,This is a fun one. Not the movie, exactly — the story behind it. The first teaser for , came out in 2017, with a release planned for early 2018. It was then repeatedly delayed, at one point with extensive reshoots supposedly planned, and the whole film’s future seemed to be up in the air once Disney finished acquiring Fox. Apparently, Disney has seen fit to just go ahead and release the thing. The total lack of confidence from Fox seems like a bad sign, but the movie seems like it’s doing a perfectly fine job of what it’s setting out to do: be an X-Men themed horror movie. It comes out April 3rd.,Here’s a sci-fi series worth paying attention to: , comes from , director Alex Garland, and it really, really looks like a Garland sci-fi — filled with glowing lights and clean yet brutal shots of nature. I don’t really know what’s happening in the show, but Nick Offerman is there with long hair and seems to be kind of creepy. It debuts March 5th on FX’s Hulu channel.,FX is making a show about why America still doesn’t have the Equal Rights Amendment. , is packed with stars, with Cate Blanchett in the lead, though I’m a little unsure as to how it’s going to build out the show in a way that’s not perpetually frustrating given that its villain seems to be at the center of it all. The series will premiere April 15th on FX’s Hulu channel.,Look, I didn’t start this week expecting to write about a cow movie, but here we are. , comes from Kelly Reichardt, who is one of my absolute favorite directors. It’s about two people in 1800s Oregon who begin stealing milk from a rich guy’s cow and using it to cook food and earn a living. It’s one of the, perhaps, all time most boring trailers I have ever written up, but I am going to see this on day one. It comes out March 6th.,I haven’t heard as much buzz about , since its first season came out, but this one has a big draw: Chris Rock, who stars as the head of a crime family in 1950 Kansas City. The season debuts April 19th.,Here’s one thing this trailer would almost definitely highlight if it were published by anyone other than Apple: , comes from the creators behind ,. I don’t think Apple has anything against that show, I suspect it’s just classic Apple advertising — pretend nothing in the world exists except for what Apple makes itself. Anyway, , looks like a ,-esque sitcom, just set within a messy gaming startup. It comes out February 7th."
Netflix’s new take on Dracula is here to suck the life out of vampire stories,"
          Jan 14, 2020, 11:56am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"There are two big problems that arise when you decide you’re going to tell a story about Dracula. The first one is simple: he’s the most famous vampire in all of fiction, perhaps the most widely known horror villain in the world. This makes surprising people difficult. The other is that everyone , they know what Dracula,is about, so each take is battling against dozens of other ideas at any given moment that range from goofy cartoon characters to Hollywood legends. This generally means any Dracula portrayal should, at the very least, have a clear idea of what it wants to be, even if it isn’t very different. ,, the new Netflix / BBC series from the creators of ,, absolutely does not. ,While the new series is similar to ,in structure, with three 90-minute episodes, its ambitions are a little less clear. It doesn’t set out to be a modern-day take on , at first; instead, it reinterprets Bram Stoker’s original novel across a wider canvas. It starts in a similar place: Jonathan Harker, the hapless 19th century real estate appraiser, is sent to Transylvania to mediate Count Dracula’s long-distance purchase of land in England. The Count purposely slows the deal down so that Harker is forced to stay and become his unwitting prey, and Dracula slowly becomes stronger as Harker wastes away. , quickly begins to deviate from its source material. The series immediately suggests Harker might meet a fate that’s very different from the one in the novel, the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing is now a nun named Agatha Van Helsing, and the rules of vampire fiction that Stoker’s novel established are slowly picked at. Unfortunately, the show isn’t actually interested in being as subversive or different as it leads you to believe. ,Despite its changes, the show follows a lot of the same beats: Dracula is successful in his bid to travel to London where he will groom and seduce Lucy Westenra, feeding on her for months. The biggest twist is that ,to London takes him over a hundred years, thanks to a detour that traps Dracula at the bottom of the ocean, setting up a final episode that takes place entirely in the present day. ,Very little about this is thrilling. The show is too enamored with Dracula to be played for straight horror, despite having some legitimately incredible practical effects that give us a few truly frightening scenes. As the Count, Danish actor Claes Bang gives a performance that I struggle to describe as anything other than ,. Everything about this portrayal of Dracula is dialed to 11, with Bang bouncing back and forth between smug slinger of blood puns to rabid scenery-chewing animal. Every other actor in , is performing for a different show entirely, but instead of being amusing, it’s exhausting.,You could call it the Steven Moffat Problem. Like ,, which Moffat also wrote with frequent collaborator Mark Gatiss, or ,, the seminal British sci-fi show he ran for six years, , is overwhelmingly built around the thrill of watching The Smartest Man In The Room. Once you notice this running thread in Moffat’s work, it becomes incredibly distracting. Stories are less about character growth than they are about the protagonist (Dracula, in this case) smugly one-upping everyone around them. This mode of storytelling has little to offer, which is doubly disappointing because the Dracula mythos has so much to contemplate.,There are over a hundred years of writing on Dracula and vampires out there, and from the very start, the original ,novel set the template for all great horror by not being about a monster so much as it was about us. Is , about desire? Cultural anxiety over the agency of women? Puritanical attitudes toward sex? The destructive rot of masculinity? All of these things? None of them? ,These are all good questions that are fascinating to wrestle with in vampire fiction, and they have been for years. It’s kind of incredible that this new , works so hard to avoid every one of them. "

        ",Julia Alexander,"The Golden Globe Awards kicked off a new decade of awards shows with a series of surprising wins in both the film and TV categories. ,Perhaps the biggest surprise was that streaming didn’t dominate the way people expected.

NBC’s Peacock streaming service will launch on July 15th with three different price tiers,"
          Jan 16, 2020,  4:08pm EST
        ",Julia Alexander,"NBCUniversal’s streaming service,,, will cost subscribers anywhere from absolutely nothing to $10 a month, but Comcast is hoping a mix of exclusives and bonus content will convince people to pay.,Comcast and NBCUniversal announced today that Peacock will be available in three tiers: a free option (Peacock Free) that comes with limited programming; an ad-supported complete version that is free to existing Comcast customers and $5-a-month for everyone else; and a $10-a-month ad-free subscription option that is open to anyone. That one is known as Peacock Premium.,Peacock Free consists of 7,500 hours of programming, including next-day access to current seasons of first-year NBC shows, Universal movies, and curated content such as ,Vault, and Family Movie Night. The two premium tiers come in at $4.99 per month with ads and $9.99 per month with no ads. Both of these tiers will include live sports and early access to late-night shows. Peacock Premium will include non-televised Premier League soccer games beginning in August. ,Comcast and Cox cable subscribers will get free access to Peacock Premium with ads, or they can pay just $5 per month for an ad-free version. Comcast’s Xfinity X1 and Flex customers will get access to Peacock Premium on April 15th. The streaming service will launch nationally on July 15th. This means that for some 20 million households that use Comcast’s paid TV services, Peacock will be a free service designed to give them a streaming option for some of NBCUniversal’s most iconic shows. ,“This is a very exciting time for our company, as we chart the future of entertainment,” said Steve Burke, chairman of NBCUniversal. “We have one of the most enviable collections of media brands and the strongest ad sales track record in the business. Capitalizing on these key strengths, we are taking a unique approach to streaming that brings value to customers, advertisers and shareholders.”,Just because Comcast is getting into the streaming game doesn’t mean the company is pivoting away from cable, though. Comcast is still a cable provider that profits from people signing up for cable. Offering a streaming service is key to remaining relevant, but the company doesn’t have the same goal as WarnerMedia or Disney, which see direct-to-consumer, subscription streaming video-on-demand offerings as the future of their companies. It’s a key component, but it’s not the entire picture. Research firm LightShed Management estimates that 80 million households still subscribe to some form of cable or satellite offering. While that’s down from approximately 100 million houses close to a decade ago, it’s still a sizable amount of people. Comcast would like it if the cord-cutting phenomenon rolled out slowly, in order for the company to keep some of those 80 million customers — even if AT&T and WarnerMedia are banking on the opposite. ,Peacock is a place for Comcast to remind customers how great NBC is as a network and drive interest back to linear TV. NBC’s linear lineup is reliant on event-type TV (,) that draws in sizable crowds and where it’s easy to sell ads. Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos once commented that because of NBC’s event lineup that’s available through linear TV, the network should lean , like competitors were starting to do in an effort to compete with Netflix. Nice try, Ted. ,None of this matters for average consumers who are trying to figure out what to subscribe to and what to cancel. NBCUniversal has three key strengths up its sleeve that it hopes will bring people in: sports options that could end up on Peacock (,, where features and documentaries related to the Olympics will stream), one of the biggest catalogs of TV shows and movies from any network or studio, and licensing deals that keep it interesting in the face of competition. ,Ask anyone with a dedicated sports network who is trying to figure out streaming: it’s complicated. Regional sports network rights make , (Yankees fans know), and the leagues still cling to broadcast network television. That’s why cable-cutters cram themselves into bars every Saturday and Sunday during NFL playoff season in order to catch the games. ,NBCUniversal looks like it might play around with the idea of bringing some sports to Peacock. This is different from telecom services that allow fans to watch games online by signing in with their cable subscriptions. Think of it like what Disney is trying to accomplish with ESPN+: it’s not a full sports network, but it’s getting closer to what dedicated over-the-top sports , are trying to do. ,On the entertainment front, NBCUniversal is hoping that it can replicate part of Netflix’s early success by relying on a plethora of old shows and movies. There’s , (but , when it leaves Netflix), ,and many more. Both ,and ,will be Peacock exclusives, with many of the other series still available on streaming services like Hulu. ,This is where “I don’t know how to watch TV anymore” comes in. Comcast and NBCUniversal used to be a part of Hulu, but Disney took over full control in 2019. As part of the deal, some NBCUniversal titles will remain on Hulu but ,. This includes day-after options, meaning that a new episode of a show is available to stream on Hulu after it airs on traditional cable or broadcast television. ,People who use Hulu to watch ,on Sunday mornings may not be able to do so in three years when NBCUniversal’s deal with Hulu expires. For now, ,will stream on both Hulu and Peacock, with older seasons of the show only available on one. NBCUniversal chief Steve Burke told investors during today’s event that NBC will get part of its Hulu content back in a non-exclusive deal immediately (like ,), and in approximately two years, the company can take all of its content off Hulu. ,Streaming! It’s become increasingly difficult to find everything in one place (remember the good old days of Netflix?), and Comcast understands the frustration. The “free” price tag and keeping the paid version as low as possible ($10 a month is still less than Netflix’s most popular $12.99 plan) are key to keeping subscribers happy. People will likely pay $5 or $10 a month for NBC’s back catalog as long as there are new shows, too. ,Both the network and film divisions are working on exclusive titles for Peacock, including reboots of popular shows like ,(from ,creator Sam Esmail), ,, and ,. There may even be exclusives tied into current popular shows, like late-night episodes of ,that move some of NBC’s digital content away from YouTube and over to Peacock where the company can control and profit even more from advertisements. ,This brings us to Comcast and NBCUniversal’s final ace in the hole: licensing. NBCUniversal and Comcast own some of the most important licenses in Hollywood. The entire , collection, for example, belongs to NBCUniversal right now. WarnerMedia licensed the rights to the franchise a while back, and it will have to wait until those expire (or a new deal is struck) before the ,. Since NBCUniversal owns a few important licenses and can license its own series to other streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, which rely on third-party content, Peacock becomes less of a risky bet on streaming. There’s always something for the customer, with NBCUniversal being able to rotate new and older series in and out on a constant basis. ,Comcast knows that Peacock isn’t going to replace Netflix for subscribers. But Comcast can use Peacock to offer something that services like Disney+ and Netflix can’t. The company is going to rely on live programming and advertisements to remind subscribers why linear television is still a good option. If all goes according to plan, Comcast will be able to boast a decently sized streaming platform and hopefully drive more interest and growth in cable TV.,And truly, nothing would be more impressive in 2020 than a streaming service that can keep cord cutters happy and maybe even convince people to head back to cable.

Netflix’s superhero drama Raising Dion struggles to find a Stranger Things balance,"
          Sep 30, 2019,  4:19pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"A young hero must learn to use his exceptional powers to stop a terrible threat and save his friends, family, and possibly the entire world. It’s a pretty typical setup for a superhero origin story, but Netflix’s new series ,, which launches its nine-episode first season on October 4th, changes things up by making its hero a seven-year-old. Splicing family drama with comic-book action produces some engaging story beats, but the friction between the two genres eventually makes the show fall apart., follows Nicole Warren (Alisha Wainwright), who’s left raising Dion (Ja’Siah Young) alone after his brilliant meteorologist father Mark (Michael B. Jordan of ,and ,) drowns saving a woman’s life. When Dion starts moving objects with his mind, Nicole realizes it’s really going to take a village to raise this kid, and she turns to friends, family, and more unlikely allies to help train and protect him.,While Jordan’s star power and boundless charisma is unfortunately limited to flashbacks and the occasional supernatural vision, creator / writer Carol Barbee has assembled a wonderful cast centered on the show’s charming, precocious title character. Young brings a powerful sense of joy and innocence to Dion as he discovers the extent of his powers and strives to use them to help others. He’s absolutely adorable as he sets about designing his own costume and Fortress of Solitude, which takes the form of a pillow fort in his room. The only sour note is the amount of product placement involved in his tendency to use his abilities to acquire his favorite name-brand snack foods.,Those powers add an extra layer to the traditional family-drama conflicts between Dion and Nicole who’s struggling to maintain a job and care for her son. Mark’s death has forced them to move out of a more affluent neighborhood and sent Dion to a new school where he struggles to fit in, both as a nerdy kid who loves science and comic books and as one of the few black students. ,One of the show’s most poignant episodes centers on an incident where Dion uses his telekinesis to stop skater bully Jonathan (Gavin Munn) from running off with his father’s watch. In a clear sign of racial bias, the principal blames Dion for the fight, forcing Nicole to talk with her son both about using his powers responsibly and about the hard life he’s likely to have ahead of him because of his skin color.,Barbee skillfully addresses the complicated social issues around racism and single parenthood, but she brings in plenty of humor to keep the story from getting too heavy. One of the main sources of comedy is Dion’s godfather Pat (Jason Ritter) who uses his knowledge of comic books to serve as a mentor while fighting with Nicole about his tendency to spoil the kid. Dion’s classmate Esperanza (Sammi Haney), who uses a wheelchair, fuses the show’s social consciousness and silliness. She wistfully talks about the pain of being invisible to the rest of the school, while forcefully pushing herself into the role of his new best friend. She also makes sure Dion’s fortress is up to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.,These grounded, personal conflicts add depth to ,’s superhero fare, which is more boilerplate. Dion is pursued by a monster he dubs “the Crooked Man,” which is apparently killing other people with powers, in the style of ,’ Sylar or ,’s Whispers. The creature’s look appears to have been modeled after the Mind Flayer from , and ,also pays homage to Netflix’s smash hit about kids dealing with the supernatural by setting its theme as Pat’s ringtone. When Nicole and Pat want to understand the nature of both the threat and Dion’s abilities, they dig into Mark’s research for Biona, the science and technology company where he and Pat worked together. At times, that group seems just as shady as the various government operations running the show in ,.,In attempting to give equal time to family drama and science fiction, Barbee,doesn’t fully develop either. An episode meant to establish Nicole’s complicated relationship with her older, more successful sister Kat (Jazmyn Simon) feels flat because so much character development is forced into a single episode. When push comes to shove, Kat is willing to sacrifice her career and romantic relationship for Nicole and Dion, but that loss loses its sting since so little time is spent on showing what those things mean to her.,The issue is even worse when it comes to the complexities of the superhero plot. A major twist is telegraphed early enough that it’s not particularly surprising when it happens, but Barbee never devotes the time to explaining why or how it happens, making the shift feel jarringly abrupt. It’s particularly frustrating since the first season’s final episode includes a flashback to Nicole meeting Mark, which is sweet, but it easily could have come earlier in the show, leaving space for showing why events suddenly come to a head and how the story reached this point.,The climax is also watered down by the dual mandate to have Nicole’s personal plot reach its own conclusion. It’s discordant to watch her get so excited about finally earning health insurance and rekindling her passion for dancing right as her son is being threatened by a murderous monster. Late in the season, , brings up unusually powerful points about male entitlement and accepting boundaries. It directly confronts traditional TV plots, but, again, it’s brought up and resolved so quickly that it loses the intended impact.,Integrating personal dramas into comic-book stories is nothing new. That balance is at the heart of the CW’s slate of superhero soap operas, and it defines Peter Parker’s struggles to manage high school while he’s fighting supervillains. But the distance ,creates between the two elements by centering the story on the hero’s normal mother makes the show feel disjointed. Spider-Man’s plots can come to a head when he has to save a bus with his classmates on it, but there’s no reason for Nicole’s maybe-love-interest dance instructor to show up anywhere near the final showdown with the Crooked Man.,The mundane nature of the personal dramas in , creates further dissonances with the big stakes of its comic-book elements. The CW shows boost soap opera drama to superhero levels work by making the personal plotlines as outsized as the action, as characters learn that close relatives are secret supervillains or time-travelers. ,is clearly trying to mimic , with its intergenerational conflicts and focus on how relationships grow and change in the face of the unknown, but that show’s ensemble nature makes it easier to have a lot of smaller stories that only coalesce during the setpiece finish. After a decidedly underwhelming climax, ,teases its next season by setting up an even more trite cliffhanger. There’s certainly potential in the show’s premise and charming cast, and in its ambitious attempts to address issues that superhero stories normally avoid. But in order to succeed, the writers will need to find a better balance between the disparate parts."
"The Magicians made death matter again, but now it’s got to live with that","

        ",Joshua Rivera," is in a very peculiar place. In its fifth season, the Syfy show is pretty much out of material to adapt from the novels. This is something season 4 spent most of its time preparing for, with a big bad — a monster that possessed Eliot (Hale Appleman), perhaps the most charming member of the cast — that was an invention of the series. But it’s also now a show in mourning, and it’s going to take a while to get that out of its system.,The last season of , was a bit of a mess overall, but it concluded with an absolute stunner: the death of starring character Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph). For a show that plays as fast and loose with mortality as ,, Quentin’s death felt significant and weighty, like it really meant it this time. (And, according to the show’s producers, ,.),To drive this home, season 5 spends a significant amount of time grieving Quentin. In the first three episodes sent to critics in advance, the show’s cast is dealing with the ramifications of his death and its immediate fallout, a world where there is , magic. Alice (Olivia Dudley) has sunk into a deep depression and does something drastic to cope. Eliot and Margo (Summer Bishil) return to the land of Fillory to discover that, somehow, they have warped 300 years into a future where their friends Josh (Trevor Einhorn) and Fen (Brittany Curran) have been deposed and killed by a “dark king” who now rules the magical land. Penny (Arjun Gupta) finds himself with a job offer; the surplus of magic has led to several more people with his rare talent of teleporting across worlds, and Dean Fogg (Rick Worthy) of Brakebills University needs someone to train them. ,The show is taking its time right now, but I’m not terribly inclined to give it trouble for that. Even if its new season is a bit slower than I would like at the moment, it’s still the rare adaptation that’s better than its source material. The reason for this is simple: ,never really bothered with straight adaptation. The books were often just suggestions, with scenes pulled out of context and repurposed and ideas remixed until they became something weirder and new.,But the series did all of this while remaining true to the spirit of the novels. , trilogy of books was, among other things, about a white male protagonist who believed he was the center of the story and painfully learning that he was not. ,show is furthering this goal, painting the world around him in vibrant, gleefully vulgar shades, allowing each of its characters to have their day in the sun. ,This is perhaps why I will watch , until the sun goes out: it is better than any show, outside of the , canon, at building out spectacularly messy characters with enough chaotic energy to blot out the sun and still have the audience care about them. Watching a season of , is like watching a series of barely controlled yet wholly sympathetic nuclear meltdowns that might end the world but are also incredibly moving. Every character needs therapy, and the ones that are in it should probably go more. I love them all deeply. ,Despite its dour start, ,is a joy to watch moment to moment, and the canvas feels wide open in a way it hasn’t since the show’s stellar third season. It might take a little while to kick into gear, but ,has always been a show that knows how to make a wait worthwhile. That’s how magic works, right? Lots of painstaking and careful preparation, all for a beautiful disaster we never see coming. "

Transparent’s musical finale lays out the series’ intent and its legacy,"
          Oct  1, 2019, 12:58pm EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"About halfway through ,’s movie-length series finale, which hit Amazon on September 27th, the feisty Shelly Pfefferman (played by Judith Light) sings a song to her judgmental middle-aged children called “Your Boundary Is My Trigger,” where she uses the kids’ own language against them. She says that every time they block her from commenting on or meddling in their lives, she considers it a personal assault because it’s like they’re convicting her of bad parenting without letting her mount a defense. The moment is classic ,, playfully interrogating modern therapy-speak, while also understanding that when troubled people finally own their feelings, the process can hurt others.,The scene is also, frankly, kind of hard to watch, because the song itself is so clumsy and corny. But then that’s true to ,, too.,Throughout the show’s first four seasons, creator Jill Soloway took huge chances not just with ,’s storytelling, but with its characters. Soloway was never afraid to let the members of the Pfefferman family come off as whiny or self-absorbed, because that was the whole point of the series. ,suggests that working toward becoming a better person sometimes forces people to elevate personal needs over the comfort and complacency of a group. But that wrenching kind of change ultimately affected , itself, as behind-the-scenes drama and larger cultural trends affected the way even longtime fans saw the show.,It’s impossible to discuss ,’s legacy without confronting the problem of Jeffrey Tambor, who won an Emmy for playing Maura Pfefferman, the series’ lead character: a well-to-do former UCLA professor who transitions from male to female late in life. (She’s the “trans parent” of the title.) When Tambor was accused of sexual harassment and abusive behavior in 2017 — not long after season 4 debuted — the scandal raised questions about this cutting-edge dramedy’s progressive bona fides.,Tambor doesn’t appear in ,’s final episode, titled “Musicale Finale.” He predicted in 2017 that he’d be dropped from the show, but he didn’t officially resign. Instead, Amazon Studios conducted an official investigation into the allegations, then cut ties with the actor. The finale’s plot easily explains the absence: it’s set in the wake of Maura’s death, and it’s about how the family struggles to move on.,Removing the character who’d been the face of , since it launched in 2014 doesn’t seem that jarring, because the truth of the matter is that Tambor had been a thorny issue for the series for a while… not because of anything he’d done, but because he isn’t transgender himself. Soloway initially defended the decision to cast a cisgender actor as Maura, noting that Tambor’s name and performance (which, for the most part, was brilliant) brought visibility to the project, and gave the show enough clout to fill the cast with trans performers. But the longer the show stuck around — and the more it illuminated the perspectives of trans women — the more off-brand that original choice became., was never wholly about Maura, though. The show was inspired by the experiences Jill and their sister Faith went through when the person they’d known their whole lives as their father suddenly became their mother. So most episodes of the show spent just as much time following the lives of the Pfefferman children. The restless Sarah (Amy Landecker), the clumsily well-meaning Josh (Jay Duplass), and the adventurous, intellectual Ali (Gaby Hoffmann) — who in later seasons identifies as the gender non-binary Ari — are all deeply affected by Maura’s transition. It gives them permission to face up to their own desires and their own pasts.,In the early episodes, Soloway mostly used the show’s premise to capture and satirize the preoccupations of anxious, upper-middle-class Los Angelenos. But by the end of season 1, ,started becoming more ambitious. The flashback episode “Best New Girl” put Maura’s early attempts at understanding the allure of women’s clothes in the context of sexual exploration and the permissive culture of academia. Season 2 went further, developing Soloway’s themes of Jewish suffering and guilt by connecting the Pfeffermans’ story to the gender-bending decadence of pre-Nazi Berlin.,Later seasons were hampered by the kind of repetitiveness that tends to set in with stories about deeply flawed people. Because it would’ve been undramatic for Maura, Shelly, Sarah, Josh, and Ari to fix themselves, , fell into predictable narrative patterns, where the Pfeffermans would have some breakthrough — reckoning with a buried trauma, embracing an identity, committing to a healthy relationship, et cetera — before their usual neediness and self-doubt would knock them back to square one.,That’s why some fans of mature, sophisticated TV never got on board with ,. Not only could the Pfeffermans be bad company, they also weren’t so different from conventional television characters, continually making the same mistakes.,But for the show’s fervent fans, it remained a must-see from start to finish, because any given episode could be another one-of-a-kind classic. Take season 2’s “Man on the Land,” where Maura attends a women’s music festival and is startled to discover that a vocal subset of feminists refuse to celebrate transgender stories, because they see them as another example of men pulling attention away from women. Some ,sequences were startling and beautiful, as in season 3’s “To Sardines and Back,” which starts with a prologue that shows pieces of the Pfeffernans’ life through a pet turtle’s point of view. ,“Musicale Finale” is very much in the spirit of these memorable standalone ,episodes. It’s overstuffed by default. Soloway doesn’t try to put a pretty bow on every storyline, but nearly all the characters, even the non-Pfeffermans, get some screen time to suggest where they might be headed after the closing credits. The finale also includes some fine examples of the show’s tangled ego-clashes. Shelly feels affronted when her kids chastise her for calling Ari their “sister” instead of their “sibling,” at a time when they’re all supposed to be more focused on their grief than on their self-identities. Meanwhile, Ari gets offended that they don’t have a say about Maura’s wish to be cremated.,Mostly, “Musicale Finale” stands out because of its songs (written by Faith, with Jill’s input). Not all of them are as cringe-inducing as “Your Boundary Is My Trigger.” The episode features some truly lovely numbers, including the opener, “Sepulveda Boulevard,” the lilting recurring song “Father’s House,” and the moving “Your Shoes,” in which the actor Shelly has hired to play Maura in a play about her life sings what she’d always wanted to hear her ex-husband say.,Even more than Maura’s death, Shelly’s play is the finale’s unifying element. It’s what gives Soloway (who directed “Musicale Finale,” and co-wrote it with Faith) the chance to comment on Tambor’s absence from the episode, by reminding the audience that this series was always a work of fiction, drawn from real life, but affected by the contributions of the actors and crew. The play also sets up the central clash between Shelly and her children, who resent the way she seems to have replaced them with versions of themselves she can control.,A lot about the finale feels rushed or ill-considered, right up to the catchy but silly closing number, “Joyocaust,” which suggests Jews need to embrace pleasure to put their history of pain behind them. But the meta aspects of Shelly’s play are a conceptual masterstroke. , shouldn’t just be remembered as the show that introduced millions of TV-watchers to a complex, charismatic transgender heroine. It’s also been a show about who gets frame stories, and how. Seen one way, Maura’s journey of self-discovery is inspiring and empowering. Seen another way, her being true to herself has come at the expense of some of her loved ones, and has become a retroactive excuse for lying and infidelity.,The ,finale isn’t wholly about mourning Maura. It’s more about how the culture at large will continue to argue about what we owe to each other and what we owe to ourselves, and whether the two can be reconciled. And it’s a debate worth having, so long as the people involved are honest and open, and can understand that one person’s boundary is another’s trigger."

The Downton Abbey movie is a terrific excuse to revisit Gosford Park,"
          Sep 20, 2019, 12:03pm EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,, a multi-Oscar-nominated 2001 drawing-room mystery, written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman. A riff on the classic “murder at a sprawling country estate” story, the movie features a cast of accomplished UK and American actors — including Helen Mirren, Richard E. Grant, Stephen Fry, Clive Owen, Emily Watson, Kelly Macdonald, and Ryan Phillippe — playing 1930s rich folks and servants, gathered for a weekend of dining and hunting that gets interrupted by their host’s suspicious death. Altman and Fellowes have fun with the rigidity of the British class system and the arcane rituals of service — just as Fellowes would do again a decade later with the creation of hit TV series ,.,Because the feature film version of , arrives in theaters across the United States this weekend.,Fellowes’ visually splendid, addictively melodramatic series became a sensation when it debuted on ITV in 2010 and then on PBS in the US in 2011. Over the course of its six seasons, , covered roughly 15 years in the life of the landed, aristocratic Crawley family as well as their servants and tenants. Set between 1912 and 1926, the show charts how the turbulence of the early 20th century — the wars, economic booms and busts, and various progressive social causes — eroded England’s old order, closing the curtain on an era when only the idle rich could dictate how their country was run.,The 2015 series finale left the door open for more stories about the Crawleys. The ,movie is set in 1927, and it uses the hubbub of a royal visit as a way to catch fans up on what the family and their employees have been up to since the show ended. The two-hour film — running just a little less than the length of three TV episodes — mixes the show’s usual wry humor and exaggerated intrigue into an examination of how even the honor of hosting a king and queen could come to mean something different in a decade marked by pro-democratic and anti-colonialist movements.,From the start, , won acclaim for its lavish re-creations of period fashions and decor. But the show’s massive popularity was just as attributable to its soapy plots, which dealt with forbidden romance, sexual indiscretion, and yes, murder. In that way, the series was a natural successor to ,. (, was originally developed as a TV version of , before Fellowes decided to take the project in a different direction.) On a narrative level, the 2001 Altman movie is like several episodes of the series: over the course of its 137 minutes, it gradually reveals shocking secrets about the relationships between the servants and their employers, while exposing the many sins of the estate’s lord, stabbing victim Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon).,Tonally, , is very different from ,, thanks largely to Altman. The director had only five years left to live when he made this film, and, at the time, he had recently received a heart transplant. Late in his career, Altman entered a gentler phase, losing a lot of the satirical bite and acerbic cynicism of his earlier movies and replacing them with a genuine affection for watching talented actors do their work. For a film about homicide and class conflict, , is surprisingly congenial.,Anglophiles and Altman fans.,The late, great Robert Altman believed the director’s job was to create a sense of reality — not ,, per se, but a belief within the audience that the world they were seeing extended beyond the bounds of stage or screen. Altman moved the camera restlessly, giving the impression that there was always more to look at than he had the capacity to show. He encouraged his casts to improvise as much as they wanted and to keep talking even when they weren’t the focus of a scene, just in case they ended up in one of his long, drifting shots.,’s cast of theater-trained veterans stayed fairly faithful to Fellowes’ words, aside from some off-handed remarks at the edges of the frame. But Altman and the actors still foster an illusion of spontaneity through their relaxed line-deliveries and subtly reactive facial expressions. (Dame Maggie Smith, who went on to star in ,, does as much with an arched eyebrow and a forced smile as she does with Fellowes’ witty quips.) , has sometimes been criticized as reactionary, as Fellowes appears to pine for the vanished England where everyone knew their place.

        ",Julia Alexander,"Last night’s Emmy Awards was nothing new. , at TV’s most prestigious event. Yet the most interesting part of the evening wasn’t necessarily who won, but the commercials for major streaming services that played between acceptance speeches, a signal of how stretched out TV is about to become. ,The ads were louder this year. The Emmys, airing this year on Fox, were full of commercial spots for ,, ,, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix. There were a few scattered promotions for standard broadcast networks, including commercials for new series like ,and network favorites like ,, but it was a streaming service’s world. Apple used the Emmys evening to ,; Disney kicked off the evening by securing the first commercial break, playing a new commercial for Disney+ and ,.,Even people at the Emmys poked fun at the incoming war for people’s money. Comedian Thomas Lennon started off his evening announcing the awards show by cracking a joke about the real battle of the evening being between HBO Now’s $14.99 subscription fee and Netflix’s $12.99 price. HBO won when it came to award numbers (nine), but it was closely followed by Amazon (five) and Netflix (four). As , ,’ Kyle Buchanan ,, this year’s “Emmy telecast is really making the case against television.” ,Or maybe a case against a , era of television. TV is getting bigger, and trying to catch everything is becoming more difficult. The plethora of commercials for streaming services last night was a stark reminder that in order to be in the cultural conversation for the next few Emmy ceremonies, after newcomers like Disney, Apple, and maybe even Quibi enter the race, people will have to subscribe, subscribe, subscribe. That’s on top of shelling out for services from Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu. And that doesn’t account for possible contenders on , or ,. As ,, “In many ways, this year’s Emmys feels like the end of one TV era, as the farewells of ,and ,remove two dominant HBO players from the competition.” ,Talking about the , a catch-all term to describe the mob of new services coming out within the next eight months, has largely been focused on price. How much will it cost to have two subscriptions? Three? All of them? Other conversations have focused on high-bid exclusives. Netflix reportedly paid more than $500 million for ,, WarnerMedia supposedly paid $425 million ,, and NBCUniversal apparently ,. Last night’s Emmys opened a new conversation about the streaming wars: the cultural cost of not keeping up with every hot show on every single service. ,It’s already happening. A quick anecdote: After the Emmys ended, I texted my mother, an avid TV watcher and longtime awards show fan, to ask if any of her favorite shows won. With the exception of NBC’s ,and Netflix’s ,, she hadn’t watched any of the shows. She doesn't watch HBO shows, and with the exception of Netflix, she doesn’t subscribe to any services. No Hulu or Amazon Prime Video; and there’s no interest to purchase a plan for Apple TV Plus, Disney+, Peacock, or any other service. It’s becoming more difficult for her to be part of the conversation as the future of TV moves away from TV. ,Broadcast is still fighting to remain relevant, and still producing series worthy of attention. This week alone, NBC, ABC, Fox, and CBS are set to debut 64 shows. It’s a callback to event television, harkening back to an era before companies like Amazon and Apple were included in television awards show conversations. It’s a facet of competing for attention that , are also thinking about. ,Television has changed from decade to decade. There used to just be a few broadcast networks, then cable became a thing. That was followed by premium cable and, now, streaming services. The evolution of how people watch TV isn’t surprising. The difference between various broadcast networks, premium cable dominating television viewing, and streaming is how we watch. Streaming removes the channel flipping aspect, where different shows on different networks could be found simply by clicking through. Now, networks and companies are asking subscribers to visit one specific service and stay there. If someone only subscribes to one or two services, the chance they’ll see a show people are talking about decreases substantially. ,The Emmys as an awards show will still look the same in years to come — dramas and comedies will be nominated; actors, writers, and directors will show up to make their speeches. But how many of those shows will people recognize? Or how many will they have watched? Everything is shifting; ,’,send-off last night acted as a reminder that television can be a beautiful communal affair, but that changes when TV gets more spread out and exclusive through different streaming services. There are about to be more shows than ever thanks to new entrants like Apple, Quibi, and Disney+. How many future nominated series people watch will largely depend on how many streaming services they’re willing to pay for — or what they decide to pirate. Not everyone will subscribe to every service, and no one has the time to watch everything. ,If the Emmys no longer reflect what the majority of people are watching, because people are sticking to two or three streaming services, what purpose does the show serve? The Emmy Awards already feel like a show by industry people for industry people — talking about how to make the Emmys more appealing as a show is an entirely different piece — but if audiences are divided even more by streaming silos, a bigger question becomes why should anyone care if they don’t recognize a big portion of the nominated series?"

          Oct 11, 2019,  2:35pm EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,“The Entire History of You,” a season 1 episode of the science-fiction anthology series ,. The story is set in a near-future society where the hot technology is a skull implant that turns memories into first-person video clips, which people can either rewatch themselves or share with others. Toby Kebbell plays Liam Foxwell, a paranoid attorney who obsessively scrutinizes the interactions between his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker) and her friend Jonas (Tom Cullen), determined to figure out whether they’re having an affair.,To date, “The Entire History of You” is the only , episode without a writing credit for the show’s creator, Charlie Brooker. It’s the work of screenwriter Jesse Armstrong, a British screenwriter who was one of the major creative contributors to two of the 2000s’ sharpest TV sitcoms: , and ,. Armstrong , for writing the HBO drama ,, which he also created.,Because ,’s season 2 finale airs Sunday night on HBO., is the story of Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox), a ruthless right-wing billionaire media tycoon loosely modeled on Rupert Murdoch. In increasingly poor health, and increasingly beset by political, cultural, and business enemies, Logan has spent the show’s first two seasons wondering which of his children are best suited to take over his business. Will it be Kendall (Jeremy Strong), his doggedly committed but emotionally unstable right-hand man? How about Roman (Kieran Culkin), the impish brat torn between winning his father’s approval and treating his entire life as one big joke? Could it be Siobhan (Sarah Snook), the quick-thinking, well-connected rising star who seems to value social status over her nominally liberal ideals? It definitely won’t be Connor (Alan Ruck), a lifelong playboy who knows nothing about business or government — but still thinks he should be the next president of the United States.,HBO didn’t send this season’s finale to critics in advance, but if it’s anything like season 1, expect jaw-dropping plot twists aplenty. Part of what’s made , so addicting is that Armstrong isn’t afraid to pull the rug out from under the Roys on a regular basis. It’s how he toys with the audience’s sympathy: he makes these ultimately terrible characters just likable enough that when they’re knocked flat, viewers cheer for them to fight back. It’s an ingenious approach to a show about mega-wealth and privilege, illustrating how easy it is for ordinary people to develop a rooting interest in powerful folks whose lives and work make the world worse.,Armstrong has finessed this trick throughout his writing and producing career, exploring how even at their lousiest, human beings are more relatable than many may want to believe. That’s definitely one of the tactics he uses in “The Entire History of You,” which presents its hero Liam as cruel and destructive as he pursues his suspicions about his wife’s infidelity, but also shrewd in the way he uses his lawyerly intuition to unpack the layers of meaning in every casual gesture or offhand remark. Even when he’s wrong, Liam’s lack of trust mostly seems reasonable.,Another way “The Entire History of You” resembles , (as well as , and HBO’s ,, which Armstrong wrote for in season 1) is in its fascination with painfully awkward group interactions. This has become ,’s primary organizing principle, sending the Roy clan to a new location or event in each episode, then watching them squirm through meet-and-greets. Similarly, in the opening third of “The Entire History of You,” Jonas makes a wince-inducing spectacle of himself at a dinner party, bloviating about sex and technology while Ffion giggles and Liam seethes.,Fans of dystopian science fiction and biting social satire.,Like a lot of the best ,episodes, “The Entire History of You” considers big technological breakthroughs in microscopic detail, looking at how they might affect everyday life. If people could revisit their own memories with perfect recall, what would change? Armstrong imagines a world where airport security scans passengers’ brains to make sure they haven’t met with any terrorists, and where parents tap into their children’s memory chips to check on their babysitters. Rather than swapping pet-peeve anecdotes, friends instead show each other their videos, seeking validation for whatever slights they’ve perceived.,The most provocative element in “The Entire History of You,” though, has to do with the idea that recorded memories could prevent people from misremembering or misrepresenting their own experiences — thereby insuring that the news is more accurate, the justice system is more efficient, and marital arguments are more easily resolved. On the contrary, Armstrong shows Liam and Ffion both editing and shaping and reinterpreting their own memories, until even the happiest moments of their lives become instruments of torture.,Netflix.

Genndy Tartakovsky’s dinosaur epic Primal turns compassion into a survival tool,"
          Oct  7, 2019,  6:10pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"fIn “Spear and Fang,” the first episode of the new animated Adult Swim show ,, the caveman Spear (Aaron LaPlante) sees his mate and young children devoured by a pack of horned dinosaurs. Later in the episode, he winds up fighting that same pack alongside a , dubbed Fang, and he befriends her two young children. It’s a sweet redemptive moment, suggesting that Spear might be able to regain something of what he’s lost. Then the leader of the dino pack shows up and eats the babies.,and ,creator Genndy Tartakovsky designed , as a brutal show about survival in a fantastic version of prehistoric times, where early hominids, dinosaurs, ice age megafauna, and monstrous creatures that never actually existed are all trying to kill and eat each other. And yet his grimdark intro conceals a deeper emotional core arguing that no one can really survive alone.,Shared tragedy forges a bond between Spear and Fang, who form a strange alliance that helps them get through the series of largely unrelated challenges presented over the next several episodes. (Four episodes were made available to critics before airing. The series launches on October 7th with a five-night rollout event.) Those challenges involve the sort of stylized epic battles Tartakovsky became famous for in ,, though with the brutality and darkness he was only able to apply to the series once it moved from Cartoon Network to Adult Swim for its ,.,Each of the opening 22-minute episodes has a set piece combat, along with numerous other skirmishes. The characters are constantly caught off guard by the diversity of hungry creatures around them. Spear’s tranquil river fishing in the first episode is interrupted by a giant crocodile who’s after his catch, and later, he has to hide from a , on his way home. One threat moving on or being dealt with is usually just an indicator that something far worse will show up soon.,The mix of stylized creatures and fantastic attention to detail makes ,’s action sequences feel like segments from a particularly thrilling nature documentary. Tartakovsky and the animators make every struggle feel viscerally real. They show the strain in Spear’s muscles as he climbs a tree for a better vantage point for throwing his signature weapon, and they underline the too-bright blood and gore dripping from Fang’s mouth after she manages to lunge in for a successful bite. The protagonists are almost always outmatched, and victory comes from the way they use the terrain, or knowledge gained earlier in an episode, to their advantage. But their greatest strength is always working as a team.,Spear might want to treat Fang as a particularly powerful mount and hunting animal, but the dinosaur is no one’s pet or beast of burden. The particularly charming second episode, “River of Snakes,” has a dynamic that almost resembles , as Spear gets annoyed with his new companion’s snoring and tries to set boundaries for what she can and can’t eat. When he tries to attach a yoke to her in the next episode, “A Cold Death,” she walks away and leaves him pulling a sled himself. But when pressed, the two always fight for and with each other.,There’s no dialogue in ,. The characters solely express themselves through grunts, roars, and gestures. Yet their emotions and personality come through extremely clearly, thanks to Tartakovsky’s phenomenally detailed animation. Spear is highly reminiscent of ,’s titular stoic hero. He’s serious and battle-hardened, which adds power to the rare quiet moments when he just smiles and finds joy in something like creating shadow puppets on a cave wall. Fang is stubborn and surprisingly clever, showing off both traits in a sequence where she repeatedly tries to climb up a mountain to rescue Spear from dire bats, but just winds up looking pitifully embarrassed as she slides down the slope. Her solution is creative and even a little goofy, but it’s surprisingly effective., repeatedly emphasizes the importance of compassion and cooperation, and shows that neither trait is limited to humans. “A Cold Death” starts with a gorgeous sequence of a mammoth herd migrating during a snowstorm, while an elderly, sick mammoth lags behind until it finds itself alone and near collapse. That weakness makes it perfect prey for Spear and Fang, though it still puts up a desperate fight.,Staring into the animal’s massive eye as it dies, Spear shows a clear respect for his prey and a regret for the necessity of ending its life. That conflict is further developed in a flashback scene showing Spear taking his son on a hunt. The episode’s writers also show the mammoths engaging in mourning behavior when they come across the remains of their fallen kin, in a scene inspired by behaviors in modern elephants. After an extremely dramatic fight where both Spear and Fang are nearly crushed by the vengeful herd, Spear is pushed to prove to the mammoths that he understands and appreciates their loss.,The lack of speech increases the importance of the show’s score. Tyler Bates, who also scored the ,and ,films, continues to show off his expertise in providing music to fight by. His co-composer, Joanne Higginbottom, brings in the similar drama she brought as composer for the 2017 ,finale arc. Their percussion-heavy tracks feel like a musical manifestation of adrenaline, building and maintaining tension both before the first blow is struck, and after the battle is over, as the characters deal with the bloody aftermath.,The sound design also helps bring the series’ creatures to life, though roars, grunts, snuffles, and subtler noises like heavy footsteps, or the rustling of raptors rushing through a field of wheat. Of course every gory splatter of blood and brutally broken bone or tooth has its own dramatic squelch or crunch, which makes the battles palpably brutal.,It’s remarkable how much pathos, humor, action, and suspense Tartakovsky has crammed into each of the first few episodes of ,, all without having a single word spoken. By eschewing dialogue, he’s challenged himself and his writers to find a way to explore emotions that words could complicate or obfuscate. He reaches into the ancient past to find the roots of empathy and cooperation that allowed humans and other animals to survive and thrive in a hostile world. Savagery isn’t enough for a species, or a story to endure, and Tartakovsky argues that compassion is just as primal."
"Netflix says Stranger Things’ third season is record-breaking, but what does that mean?","

        ",Julia Alexander,"There’s no question that ,is one of Netflix’s most popular shows, but we have to question whether it’s as record-breaking as Netflix claims. The company , is “the most watched season to date,” with “64 million member households” watching it within the first month of its release. ,Netflix isn’t exactly forthcoming about how it collects those numbers. In the past, the company has said that it counts one view for a film such as ,when a Netflix viewer’s account ,. The logical leap would be to assume that Netflix counts a season being watched as one account completing at least 70 percent of every episode that season. That would be approximately 5.6 episodes worth of ,’ 8-episode third season. ,Except that’s not how Netflix counts views for seasons of a show. A footnote in Netflix’s fourth , states that for each series, “due to their highly variable length, we count a viewer if they substantially complete at least one episode (70 percent).” That’s 70 percent of one episode, not 70 percent of an entire season. The number was first used to talk about ,, a Spanish teen drama that has become a phenomenon on sites like Tumblr. Netflix reported that 20 million accounts watched the show’s first season in four weeks. ,Since then, Netflix has used this methodology for all of its reported numbers, a Netflix representative confirmed to ,. Since Netflix doesn’t work with third-party companies like Nielsen to confirm those numbers, it’s difficult to say just how accurate they are. Nielsen , when ,’ third season first debuted, and found that 26.4 million unique viewers in the United States watched the show within its first three days. Netflix’s own report discovered that more than 40 million people watched the show within its , To be fair, Nielsen’s numbers don’t take into account mobile, tablet, or laptop viewing. ,What’s obvious from both sets of numbers is that ,is an obvious hit for Netflix. What’s interesting about Netflix’s reported numbers is which shows and films it decides to disclose viewership results for, and which ones it doesn’t. Netflix has hundreds of original shows and films, but only discloses numbers for a select few. The numbers the company discloses are always positive, shedding a light on its major successes. While traditional broadcast networks also spotlight their top performing shows, Nielsen provides an unfiltered look at how ,show is performing. Box office numbers do the same thing for films. Netflix doesn’t have that sort of oversight.,Of course Netflix wants to show that its films and TV shows are being watched around the world, but it’s more important than ever right now. Disney and Apple are entering the streaming market in less than a month, and are expected to take some attention away from Netflix. ,is considered a show that will bring in and retain subscribers, so it’s a good flag to wave. The urgency is also probably ,, who will produce more series and films for Netflix. ,Netflix only released numbers for a few other shows this quarter: ,, ,and ,. They help demonstrate the attention Netflix wants to pay to its global market, but numbers for five shows isn’t enough to help us see whether Netflix’s original content is performing well, period.

Netflix’s apocalyptic teen comedy Daybreak is an exhausting sugar rush,"
          Oct 21, 2019,  1:01pm EDT
        ",Caroline Siede,"’s Josh Wheeler (Colin Ford) has a killer origin story. But what separates him from Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, or any of the dozens of teen protagonists who’ve struggled through their own apocalyptic YA stories is that he thinks of his life in terms like “killer origin story.” From its first ,inspired moments onward, the new Netflix zombie comedy,regularly smashes the fourth wall to deliver a self-aware series where the characters are as pop-culture savvy as their audience. The latest attempt to appeal to teenagers hungry for bingeable content,offers an unwieldy mix of winking comedy, gory thrills, satirical social commentary, and earnest teen storytelling, and it’s equal parts exhilarating and exhausting.,It’s also a far cry from the source material that inspired it. Brian Ralph’s cult hit comic , published in installments throughout the 2000s, then released as a graphic novel in 2001 — is an intimate zombie story told completely in first person. For the Netflix adaptation, creators Brad Peyton (director of ,and Aron Eli Coleite (a writer on ,and ,) go big, expanding their world as far as it will go. Peyton and Coleite extend the series’ point of view beyond one central protagonist. Instead, they take in a whole ensemble of teen characters left behind after a nuclear bioweapon melts most people over the age of 18, and leaves the rest as zombie-esque creatures called “ghoulies.”,The image of a mushroom cloud exploding over Glendale, California is the one genuinely unsettling moment in a series that mostly aims for frothy, gory fun. The show flashes back and forth between the sepia-toned apocalyptic present and the start of the school year, digging into the gap between who its teen characters used to be back in high school, and who’ve they become in a world without rules. ,pulls heavily from the ,playbook, using its genre premise to heighten the dynamics of the high school experience. In this case, it’s the difficulties of forging a high school tribe made literal. Cafeteria lunchroom cliques have spilled over into neighborhood clans, from the popular “Disciples of Kardashia” to the nerdy “STEM Punks” in full Steve Jobs cosplay.,Lording over it all is a violent cabal of jocks led by a former quarterback who now goes by the name “Turbo Bro Jock” (Cody Kearsley). They wear absurd leather outfits and travel in a fleet of souped-up vehicles, but though ,is the first to acknowledge that they’re ,wannabes, that doesn’t make the cribbing feel any less one-note. Defaulting to the idea of jocks as bullies is just one of the many places where ,lazily rehashes 1980s tropes, even as it’s desperate to be a cutting-edge Gen Z series.,The show fairs a bit better with its leads. As a proud loner, Josh quips that the apocalypse is the best thing that ever happened to him. He’s a former C-student who’s now flourishing in this new reality, thanks to his natural Canadian survival skills. But since he still has to deal with bloodthirsty ghoulies, mutated animals, and those deadly jocks, he reluctantly teams up with 12-year-old pyromaniac Angelica Green (Alyvia Alyn Lind) and jock-bully-turned-pacifist samurai Wesley Fists (Austin Crute). In the first five episodes screened for critics, the protagonists trade off narration duties in episodes that dig into their pasts via their preferred pop-culture lenses. In place of Josh’s quirky direct address, Angelica favors the voiceover of a Martin Scorsese gangster drama, while Wesley processes his journey through his love of anime and kung fu movies, enlisting an appropriate celebrity cameo to narrate his story.,The constant switching of tones and perspectives adds a jolt of energy to the series, but ,still ultimately feels like a lot of style with very little substance. The show is loosely anchored around Josh’s quest to find his would-be girlfriend Sam Dean (Sophie Simnett), the affable British classmate he hasn’t seen since the nuclear bomb detonated during their school’s homecoming football game. It’s a tedious mission that characterizes the aimless nature of ,’s storytelling. This is a show that lives or dies by how much viewers connect to its quirky characters and their efforts to forge a new tribe, which they slowly start to build in an abandoned shopping mall, à la George Romero’s zombie classic ,The young cast all deliver what’s asked of them, lending a glossy CW sheen to their respective roles. (Josh seems curiously handsome and well-adjusted for someone who was supposedly a high-school outcast.) But only Austin Crute as Wesley elevates the material he’s given, delivering a funny but grounded take on a nerdy black football-playing stoner with a newfound moral code and a secret romantic past. The other standout performance comes from erstwhile Ferris Bueller himself, Matthew Broderick, who plays sunny Principal Burr. Though it initially seems like Broderick is just there for a quick, knowing cameo (like Michael J. Fox’s one-scene appearance in Netflix’s teen-time travel movie ,), he actually winds up playing a surprisingly large role in the flashback storylines. Broderick undercuts the frenetic energy of the series with a gentler comedic tone that works as an effective contrast.,Broderick is also the only one who even comes close to selling the show’s tiresome jabs at “woke” sensitivity. He brings a welcome level of earnestness to, for instance, a gag about the school’s nut-free campus. Sadly, the same can’t be said for eye-rolling jokes about, say, a character who “self-identities his gender as a seahorse.” Despite its penchant for pop-culture namedropping, ,’s biggest influence goes unspoken; it mixes feel-good teen storytelling with a provocatively irreverent tone in a way that,very much calls Ryan Murphy’s teen shows to mind. ,is like ,turned up to 11, with action scenes in place of musical numbers.,Unfortunately, unlike Rachel Berry, the action sequences in ,never quite sing. The show attempts to use creative camerawork and bombastic musical cues to hide the fact that there’s actually very little to its action scenes. Instead, ,gets mileage out of its willingness to deliver gruesome imagery. Limbs go flying, minor characters are regularly offed, and Krysta Rodriguez’s high-school-teacher-turned-demonic-witch provides some disturbing body-horror elements. (Kudos to Rodriguez for her commitment to a truly bizarre role.) There’s an R-rated edge to the violence and swearing in ,,,although its comedic sensibilities definitely skew younger.,The biggest problem with , is that for every solid joke or hilarious visual gag, there’s an attempt at irreverent topicality that falls flat, or an homage that feels lazy rather than clever. The show’s mile-a-minute pacing never succeeds at disguising the fact that it’s built on fundamentally unsteady ground. Like many previous Netflix series, , strategically ends episodes on cliffhangers to encourage viewers to autoplay into the next one. (It’s even meta enough to call out that binge-baiting practice for what it is.) Yet while ,is definitely watchable, it feels like binging on a bag of candy. It’ll give viewers a sugar rush, but without any substance.,is at its best when the creators lean into their most absurdist impulses. The fifth episode softens the show a bit, as the ragtag group of survivors decide to throw the homecoming dance that was thwarted by the apocalypse. The idea of kids banding together after adults destroyed the world is a much more timely message than any of its 1980s teen-movie throwbacks or Gen Z irreverence. If the rest of the season leans into that direction, ,could potentially emerge with a comedic voice that feels like something more than a pastiche."

        ",Jon Porter,"Sony is currently looking for a buyer of its PlayStation Vue TV streaming service, according to a ,. The company has reportedly already approached one potential buyer, the sports-focused streaming service FuboTV, with a sale that would include the service’s approximately 500,000-strong subscriber base, alongside its underlying technology. That customer tally is substantially less than other subscription TV services, despite PlayStation Vue being one of the first such services to launch. ,’s report claims that Sony’s streaming service is continuing to lose money, despite several subscription price hikes, most recently a ,. Sony is struggling with the rising cost of programming, which is thought to be hitting the company harder than its competitors. Unlike, say, Hulu, Sony doesn’t have as big of a content library of its own, which leaves it with less leverage in its negotiations. , notes that it’s unclear whether Sony’s programming contracts would transfer to PlayStation Vue’s new owner after a sale.,From a technology standpoint, PlayStation Vue offers some unique features. If you’re using the service on an Apple TV, for example, you can currently watch as many as , on a single screen. On a PlayStation 4, this limit drops to three, but the PlayStation Vue has the advantage of being the only internet TV service available. Sony has so far refused to allow competitors like Sling TV, YouTube TV, and Hulu’s live TV service onto the platform. Should Vue be sold to an outside company, that could potentially change. ,Sony may have picked a good time to get out of the streaming business, as the market will soon become a lot more crowded with a host of new players. Disney+ and Apple TV Plus are both coming next month, AT&T’s HBO Max is due next year, and NBCUniversal is readying its , as well. With each of these companies investing heavily in exclusive content — and with Vue already trailing other internet TV providers — Sony’s challenges aren’t going anywhere."
HBO’s Watchmen is using Easter eggs to signal that it isn’t like the comic,"
          Oct 22, 2019, 11:39am EDT
        ",Noah Berlatsky,"Easter eggs are a way for the people behind legacy films or television shows to demonstrate their love of and fidelity to its source material. When showrunners, writers, and directors stick a glancing reference to Luke Cage’s , from his 1970s comics in the ,, it’s a way of nodding to the fans, of saying “We’re fans too, and we can be trusted with your beloved properties.”,That seems to be the intention behind the omnipresent Easter eggs in HBO’s new , series, helmed by ,and ,co-creator Damon Lindelof. The visual, narrative, and thematic references to the original Alan Moore / Dave Gibbons comic are obsessive and ubiquitous. But they don’t show that the series is keeping the faith. The Easter eggs inadvertently highlight how different HBO’s , is from the comic. A , packed with Easter eggs doesn’t show how faithful Lindelof and crew are to the original. It shows the ways they’re striking out on their own.,As a sequel set in the same world as the original comic, the ,series broadly references the original in plot and world-building. The white supremacist group the Seventh Cavalry has adopted Rorschach inkblot masks, inspired by the one worn by ,’s vigilante hero. They quote from his journal, altering the text to make the fascist and racist subtext more explicit. Robert Redford, whose presidential campaign was just getting started at the end of the , comic, has been president in the series for some 30 years. There’s a miniseries event on TV about the 1940s superhero group the Minutemen, and it plays in the background of many scenes, reiterating, elaborating on, or parodying events from the comic.,But there are also a lot of gratuitous visual nods to the original series. These don’t contribute to consistent world-building; they simply wave to fans. Some of the most blatant ones in the pilot episode include:,And those are only some of the references in the first episode. As the series continues (the first six episodes were provided to critics), there are many, many more, particularly paralleling the comic’s obsessive imagery around clock faces with the hands nearing midnight.,These Easter eggs aren’t thematically or even really visually integrated into the series. The egg-yolk smile doesn’t mean anything in the context of the show except, “Hey, fans of the original ,! Here’s a smiley face!” It’s a fun wink, but that’s a radically different approach to image repetition than Moore’s careful, obsessive parallels in the comic. ,The most famous example of Moore and Gibbons’ use of visual motifs is the Comedian’s smiley-face button, stained with blood. The first image of the first issue is of the button lying in the gutter. The last image of the last issue is of a man wearing a smiley-face shirt stained with a splotch of ketchup so it matches the opening image. The , graphic novel starts and ends in the same place. It’s a perfect closed system — a smiley-faced, bloody loop with no escape., the comic is remorselessly self-contained. Dave Gibbons’ nine-panel-per-page grid sometimes shifts, as two, three, or four panels fuse into one, but it never opens up. Ominous recurring or parallel images — a nuclear hazard sign, the inkblots on Rorschach’s mask, a butterfly in a frozen wasteland — appear and reappear, not as random in-jokes, but as signposts in Moore’s narrative maze. They’re a reminder that readers can’t get out. , is meant to put readers in the blue skin of Dr. Manhattan, who sees all time at once, and so is hopelessly frozen in his own destiny. He sees himself as locked in the grid of what he has done and will do. Superhero stories are usually about how remarkable individuals can transform the world. , is about how even heroes (and in Dr. Manhattan’s case, even god-like beings) can be stuck in the boxes the world creates for them.,And even though the comic’s conclusion points to a more peaceful future, it’s hard to see things really improving in its world, or even continuing. , is a complete and circular story, set in a grim world where inevitable cataclysm is eternally approaching. That uniquely airless sense of sadness and melancholy is one of its primary draws.,A , sequel was, by definition, never going to reproduce that sense of a world that couldn’t support a sequel. The television show is a looser, messier, more seat-of-the-pants affair than the comic, jumping from a recreation of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre to police drama to domestic sit-com in a helter-skelter scramble of genre tropes. That’s part of what gives the series the sense of hope and open possibilities that isn’t much evident in the comic, with its slow, measured tread toward doom.,In , the series, Lindelof and company constantly let viewers know they’re riffing on a past product. That neatly fits the world of the show, which is dedicated to riffing and improvisation, too. President Robert Redford and Tulsa’s leadership are trying to get out of the grid of racism by introducing new policies and new ideas — most notably, reparations and an acknowledgement of racist history. The original , was a story about a world with no options. The new series is about how people can maybe get from nowhere to somewhere, if they have some imagination and an awareness of where they come from. And that theme is drawn more clearly in upcoming episodes.,Lindelof doesn’t drop a yolky smile in his show’s pilot to signal that he’s serving up the same meal Alan Moore offered. He’s showing us that he has an entirely new shell for this story. The TV show keeps nudging fans to remember the original comic so it can show off how it’s trying to go somewhere else. It’s a constant reminder that the show isn’t as thoroughly thought-through and self-contained as the source material. But we already have the , comic for that. The TV series breaks a few eggs to see what kind of omelet comes out."
Netflix’s Living With Yourself fuses sitcom humor with high-tech anxiety,"
          Oct 18, 2019,  3:06pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"Netflix’s ,which launches on October 18th, is in many ways a standard sitcom. ,’s Paul Rudd stars as Miles Eliot, a man whose marriage and career are  floundering as he faces the general malaise of approaching middle age. The catch is that he attempts to get out of his familiar rut by cloning himself.,To be fair, that wasn’t actually his goal. Miles gets a tip from zero-turned-office-hero co-worker Dan (Desmin Borges of ,) about a highly exclusive spa that gives its clients’ DNA a detox and lets them live up to their full potential. Desperate enough to pay Top Happy Spa’s $50,000 fee, Miles lies down in a treatment chair and wakes up as a new man, filled with a zest for life that has him sticking his head out car windows to breathe in the fresh air like a dog, cooking elaborate meals for his wife Kate (Aisling Bea), and outshining Dan at the office. The problem is that Original Miles wakes up in a body bag in a local forest preserve, and isn’t particularly happy to have a new and improved version of himself taking over his life.,The show’s eight, roughly 30-minute episodes largely alternate between the perspectives of Original Miles and his clone, demonstrating Rudd’s remarkable ability to play both a charming maniac and a worn-out schlub. It’s a transformation playfully shown off in a sequence where New Miles tries to act more like his progenitor by swapping out his crisp button-down shirt for a toothpaste-stained sweater, mussing his hair, lowering his voice a few notches, and sucking all enthusiasm from his tone. Almost every episode ends on a cliffhanger, and much of the series’ drama involves rewinding a sequence involving one Miles to show what the other version was up to at the time, and how it led to events playing out the way they did.,Conceptually, ,is fairly similar to the 1996 Michael Keaton rom-com ,, with Miles quickly hatching a plan to have his clone do everything he doesn’t want to do, like going to work or hosting a party. But while , largely leans on sexist clichés, with clones becoming more feminine or masculine based on what tasks they’re assigned, ,writer-creator Timothy Greenberg stays more grounded by focusing on the question of how people can wrestle with the worst parts of their natures to become better people.,In that way, ,hews closer to ,, which also uses a fantastical premise to explore the potential for self-improvement. Greenberg’s show is less whimsical, but he still inserts absurdist humor into many awkward situations, like the extremely unsettled look a cashier gives New Miles as she lists the items he’s picking up, including rope, a baseball bat, and a pillowcase he’s sized for his own head. The fast gags help break up Miles’ externalized personal struggles, as well as the tensions caused by both versions of him wanting to make things right with Kate.,Greenberg isn’t especially concerned with the science involved in his premise. He just barely explains that Top Happy makes a clone with some genes improved, then transfers memories from the original client, who’s typically killed in the process. The problem is that the rules feel wildly inconsistent. New Miles knows all the moves to the dance he and Kate choreographed for their wedding, which is repeatedly performed for both comedic and emotional effect, but he’s incredibly clumsy with her in bed. One of the defining differences between the two versions of Miles seems to be that the new one doesn’t feel any of the frustration or resentment that’s been weighing down the old one since he and Kate moved to the suburbs five years ago, after Kate’s failed first pregnancy. But it’s remarkably unclear why a DNA refresh would rid Miles of his actual disappointments, especially as cracks begin to form in his psyche as he fails to seize the life to which he feels entitled.,The dynamic between Kate and Miles is wonderful, though, and Kate can also stand on her own in scenes, like the one where she chews out her tantrum-throwing tech-mogul client, showing a keen understanding of the way men can be driven by insecurities. An episode from her perspective shows the strength her marriage to Miles once had, but the show doesn’t devote enough time to how it fell apart. It’s possible most of the blame is meant to be put on Kate’s failure to get pregnant, with Miles made culpable because he ducked a fertility test appointment for two years. But that seems too simple an explanation, given that Greenberg is otherwise delivering fairly nuanced examinations about how people grow and change together.,Instead of further developing the show’s core relationship, Greenberg spends a surprising amount of time setting up plots that will only come to fruition if ,is renewed for future seasons. New Miles takes the lead on an advertising project meant to help a telecommunications company win a big contract, but Original Miles’ attempts to prove he’s a professional match for his clone draw him into a web of corporate intrigue that’s only hinted at in the first season. While this subplot plays to one of the show’s main themes, that even good intentions can have terrible unintended consequences, its hinted menace doesn’t solidify enough in the first season to feel worth the time.,The personal catharsis meant to be delivered in the season’s final episode, “Nice Knowing You,” feels particularly rushed due to the storyline involving a pair of hapless FDA agents trying to prove human cloning is real. Their bumbling brand of comedy feels like it’s meant to mirror the police plots in ,, but it’s underdeveloped and just gives way to a dumb scene where a thirsty Miles, locked in a breast-pumping room, resorts to drinking stored milk rather than using a presumably working sink.,While several scenes in ,are too underlit, obscuring both sex and the show’s brief flurries of Miles-on-Miles violence, it otherwise delivers some impressively varied visuals. Set decorator Sarah McMillan did a great job with Top Happy Spa, making it simultaneously look like a cliché New Age spa, a business that would get raided for illicit prostitution, and a weird-science emporium. The ad agency where Miles works perfectly embodies a particular brand of extremely corporate edginess, with a practically glowing white conference room featuring wall mantras like “rebels love Mondays” and “you’re either in the pool or you’re out of the pool.” A nursery Miles painted with a cheerful elephant has become a cluttered mess used for storage. Each space is loaded with meaning that reflects back on the script to show how Miles has gotten to this place in his life, and to suggest what he might be able to do to move forward.,isn’t particularly original, but it’s a well-executed fusion of sitcom standards and technological anxiety, anchored by a versatile star. Greenberg clearly has some big ambitions. Given the time to develop them, he could find new ways to recombine the DNA of multiple TV genres into something novel and highly entertaining."
Season 2 of Hulu’s Castle Rock takes familiar Stephen King books to unfamiliar places,"
          Oct 23, 2019,  4:22pm EDT
        ",Keith Phipps,"Building a TV series around a location made famous in stories without actually adapting those stories is a strange choice, but for Hulu’s ,, it’s proven rewarding. Created by Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason and executive produced by J.J. Abrams and Stephen King, among others, the show is set in the ,, which is the setting for many King stories. , incorporates elements from King’s fiction, but it leaves the novels that made the town famous largely untouched, apart from the occasional passing reference to the town’s history with killer dogs and serial killers.,The series isn’t King’s work, but it’s storytelling that aspires to be on King’s unmistakable wavelength. It’s hard to think that this approach would work for many other authors. You could set, say, a legal procedural in the American South and load it with Easter eggs referencing John Grisham’s work, but is there a Grisham feeling to imitate? If so, could it be sustained over the length of a TV season?,The King vibe resonated throughout ,’s first season, which brought in one recurring King character (Alan Pangborn, the town’s retired sheriff, played by Scott Glenn) and landmark King locations like Shawshank Prison, all in service of a story about a mysterious prisoner whose release upends the lives of several Castle Rock residents. The vibe also remains strong in the first half of the series’s second season, a slow-burning mystery where supernatural elements recede into the background for long stretches, then reappear in shocking moments. (Hulu provided critics with five of the second season’s 10 episodes.),Starting over with an all-new cast, season 2 draws heavily from two of King’s best-known novels, but it often references them to subvert fan expectations. The first episode, “Let the River Run,” opens with a blood-soaked teen carrying a box to the edge of a lake. Then, the same character — now a little older and played by Lizzy Caplan — engages in a multiyear, cross-country ramble with her daughter Joy (Elsie Fisher), taking a series of nursing jobs that invariably end with her loading up on stolen meds, swapping out one set of license plates for another, and moving on to the next town. Her name: Annie Wilkes, the writer-entrapping protagonist of ,. As her journey draws to a close, an accident ensures she’ll end up spending more time than planned in Castle Rock, Maine, and in the neighboring town of Jerusalem’s Lot, which is the setting of King’s 1975 vampire novel ,., has bigger plans than merely mashing up two well-known King novels, however. The second season wants to explore parts of Castle Rock that viewers have never seen before. Much of this involves the not-quite-legal enterprises of Reginald “Pop” Merrill (Tim Robbins, taking over the “,actor who appeared in a famous King film adaptation” slot from Sissy Spacek in season 1). Pop owns the Emporium Galorium hardware store, and he’s the driving force behind much of the town’s shady business. (The character previously appeared in King’s novella ,.),Pop has raised four children, none of them his biological offspring. Two are his adopted nephews: the violent-tempered John, better known as “Ace” (Paul Sparks), and Ace’s mild-mannered brother Chris (Matthew Alan). The others, Abdi (Barkhad Abdi) and Nadia (Yusra Warsama), are Somali refugees he took in as teens. As adults, Nadia is a doctor, while Abdi is preparing to build a new shopping complex catering to the town’s Somali population, a growing demographic that’s been a source of tension among the town’s more close-minded longtime residents. Abdi’s time learning the business from Pop has an expiration date, however: Pop is suffering from cancer that chemo doesn’t seem able to beat.,For long stretches, , is more focused on exploring the working-class realist side of King’s fiction than the side that produces, say, malevolent spirits shaped like evil clowns. Annie and Joy settle into low-rent housing run by Ace, offering glimpses of life on the economic fringes. Annie’s false identity — she’s fleeing a past that isn’t fully revealed until mid-season — cuts off her ability to get treatment for mental illness, compelling her to find ways to steal the medication she needs to keep her visions and voices at bay. The series’s excursions into the Somali immigrant community are even more compelling, exploring an aspect of small-town American life rarely depicted on television or in King’s fiction.,But Shaw, Thomason, and the writers haven’t forgotten that King’s Castle Rock stories are best known for finding horror just beneath the surface of small-town life. They also haven’t forgotten the stories that inspired the show; they just aren’t entirely beholden to them. Characters disappear then reappear with a newfound sense of purpose, comings and goings that have something to do with the spooky, ancient Marsten House that overlooks Jerusalem’s Lot and Abdi’s new development. Then there’s Annie, who seems always on the verge of snapping.,, and Caplan’s vivid, wild-eyed performance, pay homage to the familiar aspects of , as a book and film, including Kathy Bates’ unforgettable take on the character. But Annie’s fate still doesn’t seem preordained. (For starters, the series is set in present day, making it not-quite but not-quite-not a ,prequel.) Meanwhile, whatever’s happening at the Marsten House seems monstrous but free of bloodsucking — at least for now. (Another nod: one episode plays in part like a truncated version of “The Body,” the King story that inspired ,.),This is the world King’s fans know and more. At times, it can feel like , much more. The first half of the season has to do a lot of work just to establish all of the players, their pasts, and their relationship to various aspects of Castle Rock and Jerusalem’s Lot life. Some of these episodes forget about whole groups of characters while turning their focus elsewhere. It’s a lot of setup that will have to cohere in the second half of the season in order to pay off, but it’s compelling enough to make it worth seeing where it all leads. Even if it leads nowhere — and it certainly wouldn’t be the first King or King-adjacent project to whiff the payoff — or fails to produce an episode as strong as season 1’s Spacek-spotlight “The Queen,” , remains an atmospheric, grippingly acted series that captures the feeling of King’s fiction while exploring corners of his world that even he might not have imagined existing."
Here’s what NBC’s Peacock streaming service will look like when it launches this July ,"
          Jan 16, 2020,  5:43pm EST
        ",Julia Alexander,"Much like competitors , and , Comcast’s streaming service, Peacock, is going to be entirely reliant on hubs. ,Comcast and NBCUniversal gave an in-depth look at Peacock, which ,, during a special investors event this afternoon at 30 Rock in New York City. There are more than 600 engineers working on the platform, according to Matt Strauss, head of Peacock. The streaming platform is based on the infrastructure that Sky in the UK has used for its own streaming options. ,During the presentation, Strauss walked investors and viewers through the Peacock interface. There are three different areas that subscribers can use when they open the app: channels, trending, and browse. While people are thinking of which option they want to click on, a video will play automatically. It may be the news, or part of a game, or a show, but the idea is that “when you launch it immediately starts playing video, just like TV,” Strauss said. The first image in the gallery below shows an example from a story about , from NBC News Now. ,Once people open up browse, they’ll be able to cycle through the ,. These are broken down into a series of rows similar to Netflix and Disney+. The first two rows are based on shows that people are already watching (“Continue Watching”) and new additions to the Peacock app. ,As viewing habit data is collected, machine learning algorithms will help to make titles that appear on the homepage more personalized. This is how Netflix operates and how the upcoming HBO Max app will operate as well. Emphasis will then be placed on Peacock Originals in subsequent rows, followed with recommendations for existing titles that might be of interest. Peacock will also come with a kids section, like every other streaming app, that is entering the streaming space this year. ,Then there’s the trending section. Peacock will also offer short-form content on a daily basis, including sports highlights, pop culture updates, and shorter news segments. Late-night clips, for example, ,. This includes ,clips that people may have missed — Strauss referred to it as the ability to get rid of the “FOMO” (fear of missing out) you might experience by missing a late-night episode right when it airs. This can help NBCUniversal pull subscribers away from YouTube, where many of these highlights already live after the live airing, and over to Peacock — if everything goes according to plan. ,The third section is channels. NBC is a linear network that wants to remind people how important television is, so Peacock is designed to try to replicate the look of traditional television, Strauss says. Subscribers can pull up a channel guide to scroll through, much like we already do with cable packages now, and see what’s on. They can select from TV shows, news, sports, and movies, as well as look into specific types of content hubs. A ,hub, for example, will also get a “channel” look for people to browse through if they like. ,These are Peacock’s three sections, but there are more product features like curation around specific shows. For instance, fans of NBC’s ,will be able to , and then select from a character like Michael or Jim and watch episodes that are centric to those characters, or are seen as some of the best. There are “beginner” options that give new viewers a chance to figure out the best episodes to watch, too. This is a type of human curation WarnerMedia is using to try to market its upcoming competitor HBO Max. ,More of the Peacock interface, including a look at some of the profile avatar options that will be available, can be seen in the gallery above.

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"With all the noise around how there’ll probably never be a second season of , this week, I figured I should finally get around to writing about , since it’s been weeks since it wrapped up.,There was a ton I liked about the series: the show within a show; the oddball, barely explained side characters; the way it reframes some of the graphic novel’s biggest ideas. The Hooded Justice episode, in particular, was worth watching the entire season for. That hour is perhaps a better encapsulation of the show than the entirety of the show, and it feels so true to the book that it hardly seems like it wasn’t in there in the first place.,I did find the series’ structure a little frustrating, though. Very little actually happens during the timeline of the show — there’s a murder, some flashbacks, and then the ending arrives. Nearly everything important occurred before the show started, and we just have to wait for characters to reveal to us what they’ve already done. Those twists and turns add up to something interesting, I just wish it had felt a little more like that scheming was happening in the present, rather than like we were waiting for a “republic serial villain” to lay things out for us when the time is right.,Check out seven trailers from this week below.,Marvel put out a short new teaser for , this week.

Mike Judge’s Silicon Valley take on power continues in Tales from the Tour Bus,"

        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,“Morris Day and The Time,” an episode of ,, an animated documentary series on Cinemax. For two seasons now, , has collected musicians’ wildest anecdotes about life on the road, playing alongside showbiz legends. Season 1 covered country music stars; season 2 focused on funk. The Morris Day episode is unusual, in that its true subject is really Day’s friend and rival, Prince. Each tale is introduced and narrated by ,/ , creator Mike Judge, who adds his own personal opinions and analysis, explaining who these performers are and what their music means.,Because Judge’s series , returns Sunday night on HBO.,This will be the sixth and final season for ,, which debuted in 2014 as the story of a socially awkward but innovative coder Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch), who persistently struggles against the oppressive demands of tech giants and the personal weaknesses of his own friends. Over the course of the past five years, Judge and his creative team — aided by an all-star cast of comic actors, including Martin Starr, Kumail Nanjiani, and Zach Woods — have commented on the madness of modern business, where genuinely visionary ideas get choked to death by legal snafus and copycats. The show expresses a deep , of technology, but a skepticism about the people in charge.,That’s very much in keeping with the worldview expressed in other Judge projects, like the movies , and ,, and the TV shows , and ,. Judge tends to see anyone with power — however petty and inconsequential the power might be — as something of a buffoon, inclined to egomania, insensitivity, and a lazy incuriosity about the world outside their sphere of influence. Judge has more sympathy with ordinary schmoes who just want to do a job they believe in for eight to 10 hours a day, then go home and play video games. He doesn’t see these regular folks as heroic. In his films and television shows, the powerless make just as many mistakes as the powerful.,Judge explores an insider / outsider dynamic in a lot of the episodes of ,, which look at stars like Waylon Jennings and James Brown through the eyes of the men and women who spent months and even years playing shows with them around the world, and thus saw them at their weirdest. In the case of the “Morris Day and The Time” episode, Judge and his interview subjects tell the story of a colorful Minneapolis R&B act who became famous thanks to their old pal Prince, who played alongside Day, Jellybean Johnson, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis when they were all starting out on the Twin Cities scene.,Prince produced the band, wrote most of their songs, and took them on the road as his opening act. In interviews with Johnson, Jam, Lewis, and Day, ,reveals that Prince also controlled The Time’s level of individual creativity, and even how popular the band could become. A big part of the story in this episode is about Day risking his career by rebelling against his mentor, and then reconciling with him shortly before Prince’s death.,Fans of , and backstage drama.,The animation is much stiffer in , than it is in ,, but the design is similarly flat and cartoony, like something out of an underground comic book. And it’s hard not to hear traces of Hank Hill when Judge narrates — he played Hill on primetime TV for more than a decade. Judge’s deliberate pace and clipped Texas twang lends a kind of folksy authority to his pronouncements about the heyday of funk in 1984, when the acts who debuted in the late 1970s were suddenly hobnobbing at the Grammys.,Judge also just knows a good story when he hears it. The “Morris Day and The Time” episode gets into the nutty origins of Day’s “mirror dance” routine (as seen in the movie ,) and his arm movements in the song “The Bird” (inspired by ,). The episode also features reminiscences about the days when The Time and Prince’s band The Revolution toured together, and tried to outplay each other every night. This particular tale is about the rich rock star with the state-of-the-art motor coach and the high-end after-show parties, vs. his buddies from the old neighborhood, who hosted debauched orgies after gigs, then piled onto a broken-down bus that always smelled like gasoline.

The Good Place finale is a gentle end to a challenging show,"
          Feb  3, 2020,  3:56pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"For four years, , felt like one of the most radical shows on television. A series that was initially about what happens when the wrong person goes to heaven transformed into a meditation on what it means to be a good person, and how no one is beyond redemption. That it aired during a time where cruelty led to a parade of demoralizing victories in politics and culture made it feel even more miraculous, a kind show for mean times. With its series finale, ,chose not to overstay its welcome, ending gently with a 90-minute conclusion that held no surprises — except, maybe, how disappointing fulfillment can be. ,“Whenever You’re Ready” begins its long goodbye with every conflict in the series resolved in the previous episode. Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, Tahani, Michael, and Janet have arrived in heaven and devised a perfect, equitable afterlife for all humans to go through. Upon death, everyone enters a time of testing and reflection, which they must pass in order to enter The Good Place. Once a person is in, they stay until they’re ready to walk through a door and fade into nothingness.,As the episode unfolds, each character eventually finds fulfillment and decides to leave, one at a time. First are Jason and Tahani, characters who have been underserved by the show for some time now, mostly reduced to one-note jokes. The show makes up for that a little: Jason’s departure is a small fake out; he ends up being stranded outside of the final door for eons because he forgot to give something to Janet. In doing this, he learns the inner peace and patience that makes him attain, inadvertently, the kind of spirituality he pretended to have at the start of the show as a silent monk. ,Tahani decides to not go through the door, instead choosing to try her hand at becoming an afterlife architect — a move that signals a shift in her ambitions, applying them to the service of others instead of herself. It’s a nice ending, but one that underlines a solid two seasons of missed opportunities for the character. ,The finale’s heart, however, is with the character , started with: Eleanor Shellstrop, who still has a few lessons to learn. The first involves letting go and accepting Chidi’s decision to go through the last door. The second is in helping someone else learn to let go, convincing the Middle Place’s sole inhabitant, Mindy St. Claire, to finally give up her post and enter the rebuilt afterlife. Finally, Eleanor guides Michael to the one ending that would make him truly happy: a mortal life.,There are beautiful moments in this. Despite the long-standing criticism of Chidi and Eleanor’s relationship remaining valid — the two have never worked as much as the show believed they did — actors William Jackson Harper and Kristen Bell pour their hearts into their final scene together, with a conversation about oblivion that is life-affirming and not an existential terror. The brief few moments we see of Michael’s human life are wonderfully endearing. It’s all a very nice ending for a very nice show. ,It all feels a little hollow, though. , at its best was often about how being good was ,. It is difficult and prone to going awry; your ideas of what constitutes “good” might not ultimately translate to a net positive in the cosmic balance. This is why, , argued, we need friends — other people who wanted to be good to others as much as you did, and who had different ideas about how to do that. ,Attempting to live a good life often feels like it isn’t rewarding or ultimately worth it, but ,’s best moments showed that you could build a community where it , worth it, an internal dynamic built around justice and fulfillment that, with time and good fortune, might radiate outward and change someone’s life. ,There is uncertainty in this. We don’t really get to know the kind of impact we have, if we make one at all. At the apex of ,’s storytelling prowess — the season 2 finale, “Somewhere Else” — ,the show,dug into this idea, with each character having a second chance at a mortal life. With no memory of her previous life or afterlife, Eleanor tries to live ethically, and it goes poorly. The episode ends with Eleanor nudged in the direction of finding Chidi and her former friends, and fades to black before she gets there. , I loved wasn’t one that trafficked in certainty about anything. It was a show about ,, about a secular faith in living a noble life without the guarantee of a material reward. It showed a cast of chronically selfish people learning to mitigate their selfishness by caring more for each other, even in the face of a cartoonishly elaborate demon bureaucracy that wanted them to believe none of that mattered. It was nice to see them be rewarded in the end. I want to believe they would’ve done it all the same, even if they weren’t.  "

Netflix will nearly double the number of French language originals,"

        ",Nick Statt,"Netflix today signaled a significant new investment in France with the , and a content roadmap that will see the streaming service nearly double the number of French language originals it has produced so far. Since 2014, Netflix has produced 24 productions in French, including six films and nine television series. But the new plan is to add 20 new productions, and to grow its new corporate presence in Paris consisting of 40 employees to one nearly three times the size. ,Netflix is doing similar expansions across the globe, including elsewhere in Europe and in South America. The company has plans to ,, and last year it ,. It also has offices in England, the Netherlands, and Spain. ,The goal is to diversify its lineup of shows and movies to attract more international customers, especially as growth in its US subscriber base has hit its upper limit and competition from domestic giants like Disney and HBO heats up.

It’s also struck gold with some of its foreign language films, including Oscar nominated ,from Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón. And Netflix is investing heavily in Japanese language content, including securing the ,, as another segment of the streaming wars now includes an , both new and old. ,Yet while expanding its presence in a country like France is arguably good for business, there’s also a legal reason at play. The European Parliament , new regulation regarding Netflix and other streaming services’ presence in the EU that mandates that at least 30 percent of all content carried on the platform be originally produced in the region. Amazon, Netflix, and other companies have until September 2020 to hit that quota. So it’s likely Netflix’s new investments in Germany, Italy, and France will help it do so. ,There’s also Netflix’s somewhat contentious relationship with the French cinema community, after the company’s high-profile showdown with the Cannes Film Festival over contest eligibility requirements. Netflix was , due to its limited theatrical runs, which ran afoul of France’s new rules around local releases and, more broadly, the country’s cultural commitment to cinema as an institution. ,Netflix then pulled out of the festival officially, and it ,.

Faze Clan is launching a Quibi reality show to sign its next gaming star,"

        ",Nick Statt,"Gaming entertainment and e-sports organization Faze Clan is taking a unique approach to signing who it hopes will become the next big gaming star: a reality show. The Los Angeles-based company has partnered with yet-to-be-released streaming service Quibi to produce ,, a contest that will see six users of the Quibi app compete to be the next signed Faze member. To participate, contestants will need to ,. ,“Utilizing its interactive mobile technology, Quibi — along with key members of the Faze Clan — will open up one potential spot on the Faze Clan team. Then, Quibi subscribers will uniquely be able to submit a video pleading their case for a chance to join the team,” reads the show’s description. “Quibi subscribers will then vote through the Quibi app for the six lucky people that deserve a shot at gamer glory. From there, contestants will travel to the Faze Clan mansion to go through a series of real-life and gaming challenges, until one gamer — selected by Faze — is left standing.”,It’s an interesting concept that hasn’t really been seen in the e-sports industry. Most professional video game players today are scouted either through the top leaderboards and tournaments of popular titles like ,and , or they’re already well-known social media personalities with big followings on Twitch and YouTube. From there, an organization like Faze would sign a contract with the player to bring them onto its roster of talent, which can involve being a content creator or competing as part of an established e-sports team dedicated to a distinct title (in some cases, both).,A reality show approach, however, brings a much more dramatic and Hollywood-esque flair to the process that might appeal to a different type of gaming competitor or online creator. The description for , doesn’t say that potential contestants have to be top-tier in any one game or that they even need to have a substantial social media presence. ,So while it’s safe to say potential contestants will likely need to be avid gamers and probably talented in at least one or more titles, being virtuosic at gaming — like current Faze e-sports players — does not seem like a strict requirement. The selection process also appears to depend heavily on the user-submitted videos and the viewer-centric voting, meaning it could be more about having a dynamic personality than exhibiting impressive gaming skills. ,“Over the past 10 years, Faze Clan has not only contributed to the growth of the gaming lifestyle and the e-sports community, but we have broken barriers and are not afraid to disrupt the status quo,” said Oluwafemi Okusanya, Faze’s head of content, in a statement.  “In 2020, we plan to do the same with content creation and media distribution. The,show represents our next chapter in content creation with our first premium production effort.” ,Like its ,, Faze is as much an entertainment and lifestyle brand as it is a serious e-sports competitor. It maintains six well-funded and talented pro teams across a variety of the industry’s biggest games. That includes a newly minted, Atlanta-based ,League team that just ,. ,But Faze also maintains a growing apparel business and has a massive focus on brand deals, sponsorships, talent management, and professional video creation. A majority of the 85 or so official Faze members are not, in fact, e-sports athletes; instead, they’re content creators and influencers. Even ,. As , in a recent Faze profile last November, the company is “the Dallas Cowboys meets Supreme meets MTV.”  ,In that context, a reality show on a buzzed-about new streaming service like Quibi makes perfect sense for Faze. The company is working with media platform Whistle, which produces sports-related video and other content for various online platforms, to get the show up and running, and the plan is to start the contest with Quibi’s launch on April 6th.

Google Fiber is dropping its TV package to focus solely on high-speed internet service,"
          Feb  4, 2020,  5:24pm EST
        ",Nick Statt,"Google Fiber announced today that it , to focus solely on providing high-speed internet service. It will still provide the service to existing customers who pay for it, but the company says “customers today just don’t need traditional TV” anymore when so many options are available online through over-the-top TV services and streaming platforms. ,“As of today, Google Fiber will no longer offer a linear TV product to new customers. For our current TV customers, we know you have come to rely on Google Fiber TV and we will continue to provide you with traditional TV service,” the company said in a blog post. “And we’ll be happy to help everyone explore other options to get their favorite programming the way TV is watched now — over the Internet, with the virtually unlimited choice and control online viewing provides.” ,Google says it is partnering with FuboTV, an over-the-top provider that specializes in sports programming. That way, new Fiber customers can sign up for Fubo alongside an internet subscription. Google says this is in addition to YouTube TV, its own pay-TV service that has some similar benefits to Fubo. ,Google Fiber, which exists under the Access division of Google parent company Alphabet, is positioning this as a liberating choice for consumers to take control of their media-viewing destinies. But it’s not quite that simple. The truth is that Google Fiber was forking over huge licensing fees to carry traditional TV channels, including big-name cable and sports networks. ,In many cases, what Google Fiber was paying was not the same as what competitors like Comcast and others pay to bundle traditional cable with internet service, due to legacy deals and vertical integration between internet service providers and cable companies. (For example, Comcast operates both its Xfinity cable and internet service while also owning NBCUniversal.) ,, “the cost of acquiring video content was ‘the single biggest impediment’ to Google Fiber’s wider rollout, a top Google Fiber executive, Milo Medin, told an audience in 2014. Compared with more established service providers, Medin said, Google was paying twice as much for video rights.” ,There are other issues, too. Google Fiber was offering a TV option — specifically an IPTV option and not cable or satellite — particularly so it could entice more traditional double- and triple-play customers in the Midwest and other midsize American cities, where Google Fiber was focusing its efforts early on. But the company has struggled over the past five years to make inroads in those markets as the cost of deploying fiber internet was astronomical and the challenge of beating out incumbents like Comcast became increasingly costly. ,In 2016, Google Fiber , amid a restructuring and a round of layoffs, after the company became a separate business unit under Alphabet proper and no longer existed under the core Google umbrella. (Moving Fiber outside Google meant it had more stringent financial obligations to turn a profit and not excessively waste money.) ,Google Fiber has since experimented with its Webpass subsidiary to try to deliver high-speed internet not through fiber optic cables, but with over-the-air transmission technologies. (In one market Webpass was deployed, Boston, Google eventually ,, too.) The company has also slowed its overall expansion considerably. As it stands today, Google Fiber is only available in 18 markets throughout the US. ,Last year, Google Fiber suffered yet another public defeat after it had to , after attempting a method of fiber installation called “shallow trenching” that would have sped up its deployment time, but that failed to hold up over time due to how close to the surface the cables were lying. Instead of starting over from scratch, Google Fiber decided to end service on April 15th of last year. Google Fiber is now , for botching the whole project. ,So it makes sense that, in 2020, Google Fiber doesn’t quite need a TV service that it pays a fortune for, especially as it’s still working to make its internet service an attractive option for consumers and a financially sound one for its parent company.

The creators of The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance just loved throwing puppets,"
          Aug 29, 2019, 12:42pm EDT
        ",Liz Shannon Miller,"Just because there are puppets involved doesn’t mean , is for little kids. “It’s not like they call it , Light,,” executive producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach joked with , on the eve of the premiere of the Netflix series, which serves as a prequel to the cult-favorite 1982 fantasy drama. ,Grillo-Marxuach worked alongside fellow executive producers Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews to resurrect the world of Thra. They used a mixture of recent technology and old-school craftsmanship to portray the Gelfling clans living under the rule of the evil Skeksis. While aiming for a young adult audience, the story features real stakes, dark twists, and intense action. Louis Leterrier, who helmed , and ,, directed every episode.,Addiss, Matthews, and Grillo-Marxuach sat down with , to discuss the making of the series, which features a remarkable voice cast — including Taron Egerton, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jason Isaacs, Mark Hamill, Eddie Izzard, Keegan-Michael Key, Awkwafina, Simon Pegg, Alicia Vikander, Andy Samberg, and Helena Bonham Carter — as well as some truly state-of-the-art puppetry. How the technology came to aid the storytelling, and vice versa, is almost as fascinating as the story being told.,Well, it’s the marriage of luck and hard work. So [Will Matthews and I] were thinking we’d really like to do a sequel to ,. And we thought, “Well, what are we going to lose?” So we told our agents to call up the Henson Company. They didn’t want to work on ,, but they said, “We’re working on a , thing. Do you want to do that?” So we stayed up all night and came up with a great pitch for a sequel feature. We go in to meet Lisa Henson in her office, and she says, “I’m so glad you’re here to tell us about your idea for our prequel TV show.” And we were like, “Yep, no problem! We can do it!” ,When we got the green light, that was when Javi came in, because we had never been in a writers’ room, much less run one. It was a very collaborative experience. ,We say working on a Jim Henson product is a team sport. With this one more than anything else, the theme of the entire show is unity. The Jim Henson ethos is very collaborative. It involves a lot of different artists in all disciplines, including writing. ,Everything about this project was really informed by this idea that we were all collaborators working on something bigger than all of us. The trope that was circulated was that this was a garden that had been tended for 37 years, and we were coming in to take care of it for a little while. We could decide where to put plants, but it was part of our job to keep the legacy intact and do new honor to that legacy.,Don’t mess up the garden because, hopefully, we get to pass it on to somebody else. We had all the space we wanted — there was never a mandate of “You can’t.” We created whole characters, leads, and arcs. We were given a lot of space. ,To give you a concrete example, we went in and we looked at the head sculpt for the Scientist puppet, and they sculpted him with two eyes. We were like, “Well, in the movie, he’s got a mechanical eye.” And they were like, “We know, but we have to sculpt them in full, and then we will take out the eye and put in the mechanical eye because that’s a separate prop.” And then we said, “Well, we need to tell a story about the Chamberlain’s duplicity and his ability to maneuver events in his favor. Let’s have the Scientist with two eyes at the beginning, and show how he only got one eye.” And then that helped us with our storytelling. , Netflix was developing an animated prequel series. And we came on only after Netflix called up Lisa and said, “Let’s do it with puppets.” She was like, “Are you sure? Do you know how hard that is?” It’s a testament to Netflix that they took this crazy leap of faith and did the show properly. It should be done with puppets. It should be live-action. It should feel tangible. It’s a built, created world. ,It was just luck that when we called up, they were at a new beginning, and we’re like, “Okay, great. Here’s how you do that.” And it all came together.,I think that the animated show was skewing a little younger, a little more magical. We were a little bit more grounded in this world. We felt like this was a much more tangible, dirty world. We spent a lot of time literally dirtying up the puppets.,We looked at this as a 10-hour drama. We never looked at it as “a puppet show.” We came into this with the intention of making, and ,, something that could compete with those properties. And the thing that informed everything we did was that we needed to have characters with rich inner lives and a world with real stakes. ,Yes, and there were times because production was so fast that I would literally just [have the puppeteers mouth] about eight to 10 syllables, and then I could go back later and write the line. I did that very rarely, but sometimes it did happen, and we could create those moments in post as well. , We had Eddie Izzard. It’s one of his great skills. It’s tricky because we have so many rules in terms of words. Like, we try not to assign genders to the Skeksis. It’s very controlled and scripted. But within that, if the performer has an idea, and we can make it match to the mouth-flaps, we’ll come up with a new line. , Eddie Izzard got “bugger” in. , It was really funny, and it made us laugh, so there we go. Everybody’s building off of each other. And the voice actors got very protective of their puppeteers. Like Taron [Egerton] would be like, “No, no, Neil [Sterenberg] is mine.” They form a connection. It’s a synthesis. All of the puppeteers have voices in the show as well, so they’re all over the place. ,On average, I think we were like 200 people because we also had our shops in the warehouse as well. We took over a warehouse space with 89 sets, which was about the size of two football fields. We also had a creature shop in there. So there are a lot of people, even separate from the design and art department, a lot of people in the building separate from what’s on set, if that makes sense. And then our largest days, I think we had 100 puppeteers on set, which is crazy. Some of them are doing radio control or second unit, things like that. Sometimes we had puppeteers just holding two puppets in the air as background because, like, “We need bodies on-screen.” I think if you’d ever picked up a puppet and lived in England, at some point, you wound up working on ,. It was big. ,An amazing thing about puppeteers that I don’t think everyone understands is that they can play the lead on a character, a big part on a lead character, and then in the next shot, they’re someone else’s left hand. They really are a troupe. There’s a lack of ego. They move from one character to the other. It’s really encouraging about humanity. , It really feels like the idea of an old-school theater troupe, where one moment, you’re the lead, and the next moment, you’re handing somebody a cup. That’s how they treat it. It’s really cool.,Usually three. You’ve got the main puppeteer who’s doing the mouth and one arm, then they’ve got an assist doing the other arm, and then there’s somebody doing radio control of the eye blinks, and things like that. Unless you’re Alice [Dinnean], who did Brea. Alice had a separate performance system where she was controlling a lot of that herself, with a literal Wii nunchuck they converted. So she would often only have herself and an assist because she was in control of a lot of those facial movements. ,It’s one of the reasons Brea is so good at eyerolls. ,Yeah, because that’s Alice, doing every part of that performance along with her assist doing the other hand, all simultaneously.,One of the most fun things about doing this job was every Friday, we had a meeting at the creature shop. And we were watching the people there innovate new ways of doing puppetry. So for example, one day we got there, and the 3D printers were just chugging away. Obviously, 3D printing has been a boon to this kind of storytelling. But they were building a system that was custom-designed to the puppeteers’ hands, with individual controllers per finger, so the puppeteer would have complete fidelity from his or her hand movements to the hand at the end of the rod. ,I was also there the day they first tested the AI system with the Wii nunchuck controller. We got to see, in real time, how they were taking this art of puppetry that they’ve done for so long, and in meeting the challenges of the show, creating new technologies to do the things the creature shop has been doing for 50 years. One of the most interesting things was seeing how much 3D printing figures into it now and how much that helps build custom pieces for puppets, custom pieces for everything. That process has been game-changing.,I remember one day at the shop, one of the designers very gently handed me the Emperor’s scepter. He said, “Be careful. This is the original from the film.” And then he accidentally drops it, and I started screaming. And then he was like, “Oh no, I just 3D-printed it. It’s just a perfect match.” [,.],Even though the Jim Henson Company is not exactly lax about archiving — they are the caretakers of the legacy of one of the most venerated creators in popular culture — there are certain things where they had to make guesses. One day, I went to the creature shop, and there was a guy airbrushing Aughra’s skin. He had a magazine that was printed in 1982 when the movie came out, he had stills from the movie, and some of the books that came out when the movie came out. Because nobody could quite figure out what Aughra’s actual color was. She looks different in different shots because of how she’s lit, the way any actor would look different. So sometimes you’re seeing an exact duplicate of what was on-screen 37 years ago, and some things on-screen are educated guesses. ,It wasn’t about limitations. It was about collaboration. Louis had a pretty good idea of how he was going to shoot it. ,It was very impressive storyboarding. I remember a lot of versions of storyboards.,But there’s nothing that I would say that we ever pitched, that anybody ever said, “We can’t do that with puppets, it’s too far.” Which is crazy. ,I mean, everyone’s trying to push the envelope all the time. And so everyone is the best at what they do. And everyone is trying to find a solution. So it was really very free.,An action sequence is no different from a musical number. In a stage musical, it’s what happens when dialogue no longer serves a dramatic purpose. So you always have a true north, whenever you’re staging this kind of stuff, in what is telling the story, what is driving home the emotional stakes. So there are a bunch of sequences where maybe you’re not seeing what we came up with in the room — not because the puppets couldn’t do it, but because there wasn’t enough time or money or what have you. But everything that’s in the show is there to serve the emotional reality of the world and the characters. And whether you’re doing drama or puppets, action sequences are hard to choreograph, technologically difficult. But you always have your true north of what in it is serving the character and the story. ,We treated the puppets the way you would actors in a movie. There’s a big talking point in , coverage about, “Oh, they didn’t use CGI?” Well of course we did. We’re building a world. It’s a huge VFX project. But the puppets are the main event, the puppets are the actors.,The biggest lesson I think we can all learn from CGI in filmmaking is that we need to be selective about what we choose to show on-screen. Because ultimately, one of the drawbacks of being able to do anything and everything is that you get too much. You don’t get enough of the gaps in the storytelling that engage your mind in it. There’s a reason , won the Oscar for Best Editing. It’s because their technology was limited enough that they had to make very strong choices about how the film being put together served that story. And with us doing this, even though we have access to all of this puppetry, even though we have access to CGI technology as well, we needed to look at all this and figure out, when the rubber meets the road, how do we make scenes so they’re only serving story?,That’s a very high-minded answer. I’ll tell you, one of the most fun things is throwing puppets off of things. We just had the best time. So if you watch the show, if you notice in the back half, puppets start getting chucked around more because we just liked it. Just throwing those things was the best. ,They did so much puppet-throwing that it’s going to be an Olympic event.,We got really good at it. , A lot of people are going to see this and assume we did a bunch of things with CGI. And the truth of the matter is that a lot of the time, we didn’t. You are looking at really old-fashioned technologies that are working in concert with CGI. I mean, so much of this of this product is handmade. I think it’ll be interesting to find out what people thought was what and how frequently they’re right or wrong.,Jim Henson wasn’t exactly a Luddite. If you look at, for example, ,, they spent a lot of time and money figuring out how to make Kermit ride a bicycle in the prologue, and then that technology got applied to all of the movies that came afterward. Puppetry isn’t a static art. It’s an art that depends on technology. The technology keeps feeding the craft., That said, there’s nothing better than a couple of Podlings yelling at each other.,Because they are the most puppety. There’s variations of like how puppety you can get with it. Yeah, the Gelflings are more “human.” They have a little bit more weight. But a Podling can run in, scream, fall down, jump up, be drunk, and run out the door, and you’re having a great time. A Gelfling doing that doesn’t feel right; a Skeksis doing that doesn’t feel right. So Podlings are really fun and freeing because they’re just physical comedy.,You haven’t lived until you’ve had Lisa Henson say, “You shouldn’t put that in the script.” “Why not?” “It might be too puppety.” “I guess you’d know!”, I think Netflix does, and I think other people do. We just tried to write the story that felt right to us. We were thinking about younger audiences. We weren’t consciously trying to go to “dark places.” That is part of the show because it’s part of the legacy. There were times when we would have long talks about the violence, but it wasn’t from a perspective of trying to hit an age. It was trying to say, “What’s the point of the violence? What are the repercussions of the violence? And how is it part of this story?”,Yeah, we have a written document that plans out season 2. Everybody’s very excited about it. And now we just wait to see what the numbers are and wait for that phone call that we get to go back to Thra. , If you watch it, we will write it. , I think it would be more efficient, but I would try to use the time to make the show even bigger and crazier. , We know a little bit about what you can do with puppets and what the edge is. But we’re ready to move it to the next level after that.  , Olympic-level puppet-throwing. , Oh my god. It’s so fun to throw puppets."
Netflix’s Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance builds on everything that made the film great,"
          Aug 30, 2019, 10:54am EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"In 1982, Jim Henson and Frank Oz redefined fantasy filmmaking with ,, an ambitious, puppet-driven movie that tells a wondrous story about an ancient world on the brink of destruction or salvation. In the post-, fantasy licensing frenzy, it would have been easy for Netflix to snap up the rights to the ,world, make a cheap knockoff, and count on nostalgia to lure viewers. Instead, ,and ,director Louis Leterrier has produced a true labor of love. The series , builds on everything that made the film great, and it has the potential to become a classic in its own right.,set on the dying world of Thra, followed two Gelflings — the last survivors of a small, elfin race — on a quest to restore a crystal power source that was corrupted by a malevolent birdlike race known as the Skeksis. ,, which releases its 10-episode first season on August 30th,,is set before those events. The Gelflings are a thriving society of disparate clans loyal to the Skeksis, but are stirred to action when they learn that the Lords of the Crystal are killing Gelflings to extend their own lives. ,While the show uses much of the world-building and some of the plot points from , the show has its own protagonists and structure. The story beats will still feel familiar, given how closely they follow the ,formula. To defeat a terrible evil, reluctant heroes must put aside their differences and band together, find unlikely allies, gather lost lore and weapons, and overcome betrayal. The similarities are particularly strong given that the Gelflings’ short stature and love of music makes them feel distinctly hobbit-like.,The heroes seem unfortunately bland because of the fidelity Jim Henson’s Creature Shop paid to the original puppets and their largely unexpressive faces. While the designers strove to distinguish them with a wide variety of complexions, clothing, and hairstyles befitting their clans and status, the characters feel indistinct in the early episodes. The Skeksis General skekUng (Benedict Wong of ,) lampshades the issue by complaining that he can’t tell the show’s three Gelfling princesses apart. ,While most of the characters eventually come into their own, the Gelfling warrior Rian (voiced by Taron Egerton of ,and the Kingsman series) never really gains any defining personality traits besides being brave and good with a sword. His genericness makes the moments when he’s supposed to be inspiring his people fall flat. Far more nuanced are the scholarly princess Brea (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Deet (Nathalie Emmanuel of ,), who leaves her underground home at a tree’s behest to spread word of a pending ecological disaster.,Still, the first season’s best hero isn’t a Gelfling, but a Podling, a member of an even more diminutive race that the Skeksis use as servants. The aspiring Podling paladin Hup (Victor Yerrid) is only barely capable of communicating with his traveling companions, but he gets by with a heavy dose of expressive charm and by blowing loud raspberries whenever he’s displeased.,Any distinctive qualities the heroes lack is more than made up for by the show’s villains. Leterrier has assembled an incredible cast to play the Skeksis, who alternate between hatching monstrous schemes, bickering with each other, and luxuriating in the pleasures their rule has bought them. Simon Pegg voices the manipulative skekSil the Chamberlain so well that his portrayal is practically indistinguishable from Barry Dennen’s version in the original film. That’s no small feat, considering how much of the character is built on distinctive vocal tics and a sing-song tone that manages to be both comical and ominous. ,Mark Hamill’s voice for sketTek the Scientist is just a few steps removed from the one he’s used for various iterations of Batman’s nemesis the Joker. (The similarity is particularly clear in sketTek’s frequent bursts of maniacal laughter.) Andy Samberg absolutely steals an entire episode as a Skeksis heretic who shares the secret history of the world with the Gelflings through a mix of opera and puppetry, and Jason Isaacs brings the dark gravitas he showed as Lucius Malfoy in the ,films,to the Emperor skekSo. The writers spend plenty of time showing how a profound fear of death leads the Skeksis to commit an escalating series of horrors, and not a moment of that time feels dull or wasted.,The original,film has stood the test of time so well thanks to its puppets and practical effects, which still look distinctive and well-crafted more than 30 years later. ,is committed to maintaining that legacy by minimizing CGI in favor of puppets and animatronics. The detail is absolutely incredible, from the grotesque Skeksis to the menagerie of strange critters that make Thra feel as fully realized as Pandora from ,.,Every episode brings some new visual wonder, like a giant manta-ray-esque creature ridden by a desert-dwelling tribe of Gelflings, a swarm of giant arachnids that assemble themselves into a mouth to speak to the Skeksis, or the carriages the Skeksis ride around Thra, which are controlled by giant pill bugs rolled into wheels.,The constant cavalcade of cute animals and goofy characters is sure to delight kids, but parents eager to share their fond memories of ,should be prepared for just how dark ,gets. Like any epic fantasy, it’s filled with noble sacrifices and tragic deaths, and the writers don’t pull any punches when it comes to showing the Skeksis brutally torturing and murdering characters. The show is in many ways tonally similar to the 1984 fantasy film ,, and it’s likely to traumatize as many children as it delights.,The film established a world that was strange and mysterious, but it barely skimmed the surface of its potential in its 90-minute runtime. The ,writers are filling that blank space in a way that feels natural rather than superfluous. They’ve invented past conflicts, expanded the roles of characters from the film, and built a nuanced social order for the Gelflings that helps explain how the Skeksis came to power and maintained their grasp on Thra for a thousand years. The writers have also created numerous minor touches that add to the character of the world, like beautiful, somber rituals for the choosing of a new Gelfling leader, and a way of mourning that still embraces the show’s central philosophy that death is a necessary, important part of life.,One of the most remarkable feats of building on the source material comes from the show’s use of dreamfasting, a Gelfling ability to share memories through touch. In ,, it was used to quickly share backstories in a visual way, and to build fast intimacy. , expands considerably on the idea, exploring the ways dreamfasting would affect society, from letting couples relive their favorite moments together to a leap of faith that allows strangers to move past possible social deceptions. So much thought went into the ability that the writers even had the Chamberlain show his cleverness by coming up with a way to undermine the power.,All this world-building has the potential to feel terribly depressing for film viewers who already know the fate in store for the Gelfling people. But one of the series’ many clever twists makes it clear that ,isn’t a typical prequel, and that the writers aren’t entirely bound by the film’s events. It’s just another sign that the series’ creators understand why viewers would want to return to Thra and know just how to keep them there. Given that the season ends with multiple cliffhangers, it’s clear that the creators hope to continue the show with that knowledge in mind, further developing the characters and the film’s wondrous world."

Six years before the series starts, British Empire stand-in The Burge retreated from the fae nation of Tirnanoc, leaving it in control of The Pact, a group inspired by the World War I ,. The defeat caused a refugee crisis, with desperate fae fleeing to The Burge where they’re largely resigned to a life of menial labor and discrimination.,The story primarily follows Burge investigator Rycroft Philostrate (Orlando Bloom of ,and , franchises) and fresh-off-the-boat faerie Vignette Stonemoss (Cara Delevingne of ,).

Instead, they delve into the systemic problems that trap people in bad circumstances and the intense difficulty of enacting change.,The racial narrative weaves throughout the show as Philo investigates a series of murders of fae that his superiors would rather just ignore. Burge Chancellor Absalom Breakspear (Jared Harris of ,and ,) argues that his country must accept refugees because they’re culpable in creating the fae’s plight. But even he uses the show’s colorful collection of racial slurs and seems to have a hard time telling his fae bodyguards apart. Other politicians use the same rhetoric as Donald Trump or Boris Johnson to argue that the new arrivals are taking jobs from citizens and changing the character of the country. The Burge is largely dominated by Caucasians, but it has some people of color in its elite ranks; at one point, Parliament member Sophie Longerbane (Caroline Ford) invokes her own dark complexion and asks whether discrimination against the fae will eventually be seen as the same as that against other humans. In a twist, she concludes that it won’t because the fae “are nothing like us” and deserve their second-class status.,also doesn’t simplify its setting by making discrimination against the fae the world’s only social problem. Women still have little power in this world, and homosexuality is a crime. While the fae are mostly used as a metaphor for refugees and racial discrimination, there’s also an undertone of queerness led by the casting of Delevingne, who is bisexual and genderfluid, playing a bisexual faerie. That subtext is brought home by a subplot involving a gay doctor who secretly performs abortions and operations to help the half-blood children of humans and fae pass as human.,But the best version of ,’s exploration of discrimination involves a plot that effectively combines ,and ,. When socialite Imogen Spurnrose (Tamzin Merchant) learns that the biggest house in town has been purchased, she plots to catch the new owner’s eye. When the buyer turns out to be a fae named Agreus (David Gyasi), she hatches a Jane Austen-esque plot to save her family from financial ruin by having him pay her to ingratiate him into The Burge’s high society. ,That’s a particularly difficult task since Agreus is equally blunt with bigots who view his arrival with disgust and with condescending liberals who want to hear about the homeland he was happy to leave behind. He’s a toughened pragmatist who’s made his fortune in part by helping humans oppress his own people, and he has little patience or sympathy for fae who are trapped in worse circumstances. His plot has almost nothing to do with the main storyline, but the dynamic between him and Imogen, who grows from one of the show’s most hateful characters to one of its strongest, is so compelling that their scenes stand out even as the rest of the show descends into murder, magic, and mayhem.,It’s also one of the few plots that comes to a satisfying conclusion by the end of season 1. While Philo’s intrigue-heavy investigation starts strong and involves some genuinely surprising twists, it fails to stick the landing as it ends up tangled in the show’s mediocre political drama. Both Sophie and Absalom’s wife, Piety (Indira Varma of , and ,), are meant to be masters of manipulation, but they just come across as pale imitations of Littlefinger and Cersei Lannister, respectively. Their schemes involve a battle for control over Piety and Absalom’s slacker son Jonah (Arty Froushan) who is easily the show’s blandest character. Both he and Sophie are thrust into increased prominence in the season finale, which could make them an even bigger drag on the show’s already-announced second season.,But even when the story lags, the visuals never do. Shot in the Czech Republic, the show is filled with wonder-inspiring setpieces like chase scenes along the roofs of The Burge, battles between men and mythical creatures in the snowy mountains of Tirnanoc, and assaults by the scythe-like zeppelins of The Pact. The costumes and makeup are stunning, giving depth to the portrayals of the fae with touches like different styles of horns and the scarification that marks faerie priestesses and mystics.,There’s plenty of sex in ,often made more spectacular through glowing wings faeries can use to take their intimacy to new heights, but there’s none of ,. Instead, ,s writers trust viewers to keep up with their world-building, regularly dropping terms like “Haruspex” and “mimasery” with almost no explanation beyond the immediate context. That tactic avoids clunky exposition that can bog down genre works, and it also makes the world feel mysterious and largely unexplored, even after eight episodes. It’s a clever technique that could keep viewers engrossed in ,’s mysteries for seasons to come and hopefully give the writers the freedom to continue forging their original identity."
Netflix’s new Dark Crystal reboot reaches back to the gentle fantasy of Fraggle Rock,"

        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,“The Gorg Who Would Be King,” a 1987 episode of the HBO children’s series ,, and one of the last installments of the show’s original five-season run. The story follows Junior, the prince of his giant-sized race, as he shrinks down to the size of a Fraggle, and gets a lesson from the much smaller species about what it means to be part of a community. Credited to screenwriter Laura Phillips and director Terry Maskell, “The Gorg Who Would Be King” delivers a clear moral message aimed at an elementary-school audience. It’s also a meaningful exploration of ,’s interconnected ecosystem, where Gorgs, Fraggles, and the tiny worker-creatures the Doozers live symbiotically.,Because Netflix is debuting , this weekend.,A prequel to Jim Henson’s 1982 fantasy film ,, the new 10-episode series tells the story of how the planet Thra’s troubles began when a species known as the Skeksis began controlling the world’s mystical forces at the expense of the more peaceful, elfin Gelflings. With a mix of puppetry and CGI — and with an all-star voice cast that includes Mark Hamill, Anya Taylor-Joy, Eddie Izzard, Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, and Simon Pegg — the show offers a richly imagined fantasy universe, as the backdrop to a story with real sociopolitical resonance.,This new , series could restore the reputation of one of Henson’s more troubled projects. A restless artist and a shrewd businessman, Henson figured out as a teenager how to monetize his puppetry, selling his services to local TV stations and advertisers as early as the mid-1950s. By the late 1960s, he was a regular on national network broadcasts, and he leveraged his fame to pitch more ambitious but potentially unwieldy ideas, including the kind of elaborate fantasy epics that would evolve into ,.,The chorus of “no”s Henson heard in response to his more serious pitches partly inspired ,, a hit variety series about underdog entertainers with big dreams. The success of , and , reopened some of the doors that had been closed to Henson. But when he poured a lot of his new clout into ,, the movie was greeted with tepid reviews and merely respectable box office. It found a fervent cult audience, but it wasn’t the blockbuster smash and franchise-starter Henson had hoped for.,Henson found other outlets for his high-fantasy obsessions. In 1983, he and his team launched ,, an expensive international co-production, and one of the first prominent examples of a non-broadcast network (HBO in the US) buying original programming from top talent. Though aimed at kids, the series also appealed to older Henson fans. In ,’s attractively designed and well-thought-out universe, the fun-loving title characters and their Doozer helpers live in a network of caves, nestled between the kingdom of the enormous, galumphing Gorgs and the workshop of a human tinkerer named Doc (and his super cute dog, Sprocket, an astonishingly realistic Muppet creation).,The typical , episode is like a lighter version of ,, with low-stakes quest plots that map out these characters’ delicately balanced culture. In “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” Junior learns that, according to tradition, he’s supposed to become the new ruler when the last leaf falls from the Nirvana tree. He decides to shirk his duty by eating the leaf, but he immediately shrinks. Junior is taken in by the Fraggles — considered little more than garden pests by Gorgs — and his new friends teach him about their way of life where no one’s the boss and instead everyone moderates their friends’ behavior by cracking gentle jokes at their expense whenever they mess up.,Parents of small children and fans of DIY fantasy.,Unlike the all-ages ,, , was aimed at kids just slightly older than a , audience but not old enough for ,. Like nearly all Henson productions, the show features such well-developed characters and nifty-looking puppets (with floppy feather-duster hair) that adults who appreciate fine craftsmanship won’t mind watching along with their youngsters. In “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” Laura Phillips even throws in a Rolling Stones reference when the sentient trash heap Marjory tells Junior, “You can’t always get what you want… but you just might find you get what you need.”,Each episode featured multiple catchy songs; in “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” it’s the snappy anarchist anthem, “You Can Never Be the Boss of Someone Else.” The thoughtfulness of , remains impressive. In this episode, when Pa chastises Junior about his ambivalence toward becoming king, he snaps, “You don’t have to understand the universe; you just have to rule it!” That’s a funny line, in large part because it runs so counter to the Henson studio’s central philosophy. Henson felt the way to make great art — and to live a life of value — was to pay attention to the tiniest details. Everything matters because everything works in harmony.,HBO Go and HBO Now. , is available on Netflix."

It’ll range from a quiet relationships drama (Noah Baumbach’s ,) to an over-the-top comedy (the Eddie Murphy- led ,) to prestige fare (Martin Scorsese’s ,).,That’s a significant portion of Netflix’s fall film slate, and it includes movies that aren’t necessarily Oscar bait. I can’t say I know exactly what it means. Maybe it’s some kind of concession to theaters or to filmmakers, or maybe Netflix just sees the value of first-week box office dollars and realizes its viewers won’t be too bothered by the delay.

Carnival Row is the latest H.P. Lovecraft descendant to directly subvert his racism,"
          Sep  9, 2019, 10:21am EDT
        ",Noah Berlatsky,"H.P. Lovecraft is one of the most imaginative, singular, brilliant, and influential horror writers of all time. He’s also one of the most ,. Lovecraft’s fans and heirs have , with the question of how to separate his particular vision of cosmic horror from the visceral loathing of non-white people he expressed in his work.,In the past, authors like August Derleth and Stephen King have mostly tried to ignore the prejudice, concentrating instead on Lovecraft’s vision of a grotesque universe bent on humanity’s destruction and the joys of his clotted, tentacular, Cyclopean prose. More recently, though, several writers have engaged Lovecraft’s racism more directly. These creators are turning Lovecraft inside out, exposing his wet, ugly innards for antiracist purposes. The new ,is one of the first indications that this strand of antiracist Lovecraft fiction is traveling out of genre fiction and into more mainstream entertainment.,Some apologists, like scholar S.T. Joshi, have , that Lovecraft’s offensive views were only central to a few of his lesser works, like the bigoted poem with a title that starts “On the Creation Of” and ends with a racist slur. Those protests aren’t convincing, though. Racism permeates Lovecraft’s work. The vast, terrible cosmic horrors he wrote about are always connected to his fear that the pure, upstanding white race is being corrupted and overrun with foul emanations from the less eugenically pure. In Lovecraft’s classic 1926 story ,, for example, the Elder Gods from outside space and time are remembered and venerated by “Esquimau diabolists and mongrel Louisianans” — by non-white people, in other words. ,By contrast, Lovecraft’s protagonist is Gustaf Johansen, a white Norwegian sailor. And when he and his shipmates encounter Cthulhu’s non-white human followers, they butcher them in a fury, which Lovecraft enthusiastically endorses. “There was some peculiarly abominable quality about [Cthulhu’s worshippers] which made their destruction seem almost a duty,” Lovecraft writes. In his view, the fanciful tale of mystic horror is also a call to genocide.,Most of the horror writers channeling Lovecraft’s style or subject matter haven’t larded their prose with slurs or calls to race war. But some contemporary writers are now going further by writing Lovecraftian horror that directly acknowledges and repudiates Lovecraft’s ugly bigotries.,Ruthanna Emrys’ remarkable ,, for example, is told from the perspective of one of Lovecraft’s fish-people from the story ,. For Lovecraft, the Innsmouth inhabitants were evil because they were associated with racial mixing, which tainted them and caused them to de-evolve. For Emrys, though, the shadow in Innsmouth is the evil white people bring with them when their government murders the town’s inhabitants for the sin of being different. The real horror in this story update isn’t fish-people; it’s violent prejudice, as seen from the monsters’ perspective.,Matt Ruff’s novel ,takes a different approach to antiracism. The book is set in the 1950s, and its lead characters are all black. Next to the constant threats of life inside an inherently biased, racist system, the various space creatures, curses, and ghosts that the protagonists encounter are almost a pleasant diversion. Lovecraft was imaginative and entertaining, the book suggests, but his racism and his whiteness meant he didn’t know much about fear. (,is being , helmed by Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams.),Novelist N.K. Jemisin is also planning a novel about a multiracial group of New Yorkers who fight Cthulhu. As she ,: “This is deliberately a chance for me to kind of mess with the Lovecraft legacy. He was a notorious racist and horrible human being. So this is a chance for me to have the ‘chattering’ hordes — that’s what he called the horrifying brown people of New York that terrified him. This is a chance for me to basically have them kick the ass of his creation. So I’m looking forward to having some fun with that.”, is just the latest narrative to repurpose Lovecraft’s tropes into an antiracist story. Still, the way it uses Lovecraft’s legacy is innovative, not least because it’s so casual. The series is set in a steampunk alternate fantasy Earth. Pixies, fauns, centaurs, and other faerie creatures (or “critch”) live in the segregated neighborhood of Carnival Row in a London-like city. Humans generally hate the critch, and one man with a hammer has started to murder them indiscriminately. Police detective Rycroft Philostrate (Orlando Bloom) is determined to bring the killer to justice despite his department’s indifference to the killings.,Philo does catch the murderer, “Jack,” in the first episode. Cornered, the guy starts to spout ominous gibberish in the tried-and-true manner of many of Lovecraft’s half-mad, Elder-God-touched sailors and riffraff.  ,“Think I’m mad?” Jack rants. “I know darkness. I’ve been to the twilight edge of the world and dredged up things from the sunless deep that would turn your blood cold. But nothing like what I saw in the dark beneath our very feet. You’re ill-prepared for the darkness that lies ahead. There is more here than you can fathom. While you go about your life so sure that this little world belongs to you, some Dark God wakes!” That’s a nicely baroque variation on Lovecraft’s famous line, “In his house at ,, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”,Sure enough, , meets the dark god: a slimy, shambling horror, with tentacles hanging from its face. It looks a good bit like Cthulhu fan art. But it resembles Lovecraftian beasties in other ways, too. The critch are marginalized people from a foreign land. In the series, they’re a metaphorical stand-in for immigrants, sex workers, and people of color — all the chattering hordes Lovecraft hated. “They come from a dark place and they haven’t come alone. They’ve brought something with them,” Jack warns. As in Lovecraft’s work, non-white people are a threatening, indistinguishable mass, embodied by the ugly cosmic horrors they bring to the sane, rational foundations painstakingly built by white men.,’s dark god is a creation of critch magic. But it wasn’t raised as a weapon against humans. It was brought to life by one of those humans. The Cthulhu-thing is sewn together from dead flesh, but it’s just a puppet. Someone has to magically pull its strings. It’s a mask some human wears, just as Cthulhu is a mask Lovecraft wore. ,sets the audience up to think that marginalized people have birthed a monster, in standard Lovecraft fashion. But then it reveals that the actual monster is built by those in power, who create an ugly caricature of the race they hate, then use that caricature for murder. The clear suggestion is that Lovecraft’s real racism, rather than his fictional monsters, was the threat facing a civilized society.,Lovecraft isn’t ,’s primary focus. Unlike Emrys and Ruff, the show’s creators deal with and dismiss Cthulhu off to the side of the main romance and intrigue plots. Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and the fantasy genre are all arguably more important influences on the series than Lovecraft.,But that makes the antiracist twist on his work feel even more significant. We seem to be reaching a tipping point in Lovecraft influence where even works not explicitly devoted to addressing his racism will still have to contend with his legacy and find ways to acknowledge and subvert it. ,is more evidence that the smartest, most successful uses of Lovecraftian tropes don’t avoid or ignore his racism. Instead, they confront it and use it to enrich the narrative and surprise the audience. They’re making something bigger and better from his work."
The new science fiction series from Cowboy Bebop’s director isn’t that far off from reality,"
          Aug 30, 2019,  2:40pm EDT
        ",D. M. Moore,"The first episode of , — the new anime series, and , director Shinichirō Watanabe — hits Netflix on August 30th. The series is set on Mars, 50 years after humans started living there, in a New York City-like metropolis called Alba City. It’s a futuristic world, but a familiar one as well. Watanabe pulls off an impressive trick here by presenting a world that’s just a little off familiar tech levels, just far enough to seem impressive, without reaching too far into science fiction.,The series follows the titular Tuesday, the daughter of a rich, powerful political family, as she runs away from home and heads to the big city to pursue her dream of being a musician. She’s taken in by Carole, also a young aspiring musician, who makes a living jumping from one short stint at a part-time job to another. The two instantly hit it off and start writing songs together, which is a uniquely strange thing on this futuristic Mars, as no one makes music without at least some help from artificial intelligence.,While the show’s Mars setting allows it to imagine some amazing fictional technology, a lot of what’s on display actually exists in some form today. Here’s a look at how close some of ,’s science-fiction tech is to reality., reporter Dani Deahl explored the field of using artificial intelligence to create music in ,. The idea dates back to at least the 1990s, when David Bowie helped develop a piece of software that reordered lyrics into new combinations to help with writing. More recently, AIs are being designed to generate the instrumental tracks of songs based on data from existing music. As Dani describes it: ,In , the music-making AIs generally seem to be working in tandem with an artist or producer to create a song — except in the case of Tao and Angela, whose story in the show runs parallel to Carole and Tuesday’s. Tao is a wildly successful music producer who builds incredibly advanced AIs to create every aspect of a song, including vocal performances. Tao hires Angela to be the first human he actually makes songs for. The first part of the series reveals that Tao’s programs make songs for her not just based on her vocal range, but on the words she uses and how she behaves. That’s certainly far more advanced than any AI that exists today, but then, it seems pretty advanced for the series’ technology, too.,One of the first pieces of future gadgetry we see (and covet) in the series is Tuesday’s smart luggage. It’s self-propelled, driving itself around to follow her wherever she goes, and is even equipped with little robotic legs to use when it encounters stairs. When it’s stolen, it manages to not get broken into, then finds its way back to Tuesday on its own, indicating that it has some sort of sophisticated tracking system.,A few years ago, smart luggage seemed to be having a moment, with lots of little companies springing up with their own takes on similar gadgets. They ranged from luggage with built-in batteries for recharging your phone to ones a bit more like Tuesday’s that could , to follow their owner around. Some could , through the use of a sophisticated theoretical mesh network of other smart luggage.,But then , any smart luggage that didn’t have removable batteries, and , that complied with the new rule from being loaded on to planes. Which in turn led to a number of , closing. Surprisingly, though, the only really futuristic thing about Tuesday’s luggage is the legs.,Carole’s favorite mode of transport around Alba City is an electric one-wheeled skateboard. While there have been a number of attempts at making , , , over the last few years, Carole’s seems closest in design to ,. Unlike the Pint, though, the fictional version has a hubless motor design for its wheel, and folds up for easy transport when not in use. It is also seems incredibly light, given how Carole is able to carry it one-handed and get pretty significant air clearance off the ground with it.  ,AI seems to be a blanket term in the series, encompassing all sorts of intelligent robots and software that vary greatly in levels of functionality and sentience. Carole has a personable robotic owl AI pet whose main function is as an alarm clock, but it seems to possess some deductive reasoning and problem-solving abilities. There’s also an AI music producer in a robotic dog, which serves as a judge on an ,/ , type music-competition show. The dog also has a distinct personality, and makes jokes like a human judge on a reality competition show. It’s difficult to tell, though, how much of this behavior is sentience, and how much is fakery though programming.,Current actual robotic pets are far less sophisticated than their anime counterparts, at least in terms of range of movement and functionality. Many are less animal-like than Carole’s owl, like the odd-looking toddler robot ,, or the more abstract ,. Neither is as close to the show’s example as ,, though, and that seems to be the design inspiration for the reality show judge’s robotic body.,Aibo is a $1,800 robot dog covered in sensors, which allow it to respond to voice commands and petting. It can use a camera in its nose to recognize people, and send security updates on what’s going on at home. But even with all that, it’s more like a slow-moving, stumbly puppy than something that could pass a Turning test.,The first few large-scale professional concerts in the first part of , actually seem pretty conventional by real-world standards, with giant screens acting as musical visualizers, along with laser and pyrotechnics displays, depending on the style of the band playing. That is until Crystal — apparently a sort of future anime Mars version of Beyoncé — performs while accompanied by a crowd-enveloping flock of holographic birds.,Most modern holographic illusions at concerts use an old illusionist’s technique called ,, which essentially bounces light off a film or glass to produce a transparent ghostly image, like with ,, or the real-world concerts for ,. For last year’s ,, augmented reality tech was used to incorporate virtual characters into a live performance, but this effect wasn’t visible to the naked eye for people attending in person.,The closest real-world equivalent to the effect Crystal has is the Holosphere, which was featured in ,. The two-story-tall sphere is wrapped in strips of LED lights, which effectively turns it into a sort of semi-transparent spherical display. It allows performers inside it to appear as if they’re standing in the center of a giant eyeball, ball of lightning, or whatever designs they configure to map to the sphere. While not technically a hologram, the sphere seems as though it could produce a similar illusory effect as Crystal’s birds, although not to the same audience and stage-circling scope.,A number of restaurants and bars in Alba City are equipped with touch-screen tables and bar tops, allowing tables to become both menus for customers to peruse, and waitstaff for taking orders. The one shown in a pizza restaurant is particularly neat, since it blends back into the restaurant’s aesthetic when not in use, by displaying a wood-panel surface. But it’s more intriguing to see what these screens reveal about labor in ,While a lot of the series’ food and drink ordering and preparation is automated, waitstaff and bartenders can still be called on for a more human experience.,In terms of automated food preparation, last year ,’s Nick Statt ,:,Surprisingly, the screen technology on display in the show seems like it might be more fictional than the robotic food prep. For a while, Microsoft tinkered with making ,, but later repurposed the name for its line of tablets and laptops. Then in 2016, a French company created a ,, which seems as though it could be an ancestor of the ones in the show. The fictional version still looks a bit more like a giant TV laid flat than a table, though, even when it’s off. ,Sony showed off a different approach in 2017 at SXSW, with an overhead projector that could effectively turn any flat surface into a touchscreen display. While that couldn’t have been used at the bar in the anime, conceivably an overhead projector-style device could have created the menu on the table at the pizza restaurant, while also allowing for it to be just a normal wooden table.,After watching the first 12 episodes of this 24-episode show — all 12 of which are now on Netflix  —  it occurred to me that the series’ future technology was directly extrapolated from current trends and devices. That helps speak to one of the show’s major themes — criticizing the idea of removing humans from music creation. To explore that idea, Watanabe needed to create a world where humans didn’t make music, AI did. But he also had to make that world feel relatable to the audience.,And that helps explain the show’s aesthetic. It’s why even though Alba City is about 50 years old and on Mars, it looks like a modern Earth metropolis, with some buildings that look like they date back to the early 1900s. It’s why the characters’ cellphones look like modern cellphones, and have Instagram on them. ,Watanabe did a similar thing with his retro designs on ,That show is also set in Earth’s far future, with humans rapidly traveling from planet to planet ,. But the details of the world look familiar from contemporary 1980s and 1990s film and TV. They’re modified and retrofitted to evoke a much more futuristic world, but they aren’t jarring or alienating. , does the same thing. So little of the world is explained outright, but it doesn’t need justifications and setup, because it looks so close to familiar. It’s easy to look into this world and imagine yourself there — and more, when looking at its clean designs and just-forward-of-present devices, actively wanting to be there."

I think that’s really the history of this project, is just being constantly surprised by the fact that I’m not the only person who likes this sort of thing.” ,After years of development, , (originally titled ,) ,, with an initial eight-episode season already available on Amazon and a renewal for season 2. The tale, set in the Burge — a city reminiscent of Victorian London — focuses on the humans and fae whose uneasy coexistence leads to violence, political intrigue, and romance. ,At the center of the story are police detective Philo (Orlando Bloom) and rebellious faerie Vignette (Cara Delevingne). Their star-crossed love is one of many storylines highlighting a class and racial divide, which serve as a clear allegory for modern social dynamics. ,brings in many elements to create something original, but as Beacham and executive producer Marc Guggenheim explain, they were careful to ground the narrative as much as possible — even relying on cop drama clichés from time to time, to make sure audiences felt comfortable with their new world. ,The easiest way to talk about it would be in relation to the neighborhood itself. Just in writing, [the show] has gone through a lot of different names. I can’t really remember how we landed on ,, but what I landed on was the idea that, at one time, this neighborhood was the epicenter of human fascination with these other folks from across the ocean, and there were actual literal fairs and carnivals. I just liked the mashup for those ideas.,I have a really difficult time actually separating out the in-world history from the actual history of this idea. It’s all starting to meld together in my mind. ,As far as technology goes, we try to lean on what was possible in Victorian times. They don’t have telephones or that sort of thing, but maybe they can have elevators. And if it falls into that historical window, we consider it fair game. I mean, it is an invented world. So we allow ourselves some room to budge one way or the other, but if it wasn’t something that was possible in actual Victorian times, that’s not something we’re going to do in our show. ,As far as the magic goes, one of the things that I like about fantasy stories is a sense of restraint, so that it’s not littered with magic. For instance, our faerie characters fly because they have wings. We try to root it in a physicality. So when you have magic, it feels kind of rare, and it feels like an intrusion on the physical world, rather than something that’s commonplace., I would even say that, to the extent the show delves into magic, it’s more along the lines of mysticism than magic in the way we’ve typically seen. Again, that’s what it helps keep it grounded and interesting. When it does show up in the show, it’s a special event., In a normal fantasy show, where you’re waving wands around a lot, magic usually becomes relatively routine and commonplace. But in our show, it still has this weirdness. , Even just a character reading entrails is drawn from actual history. , The name for that character [played by Alice Krige] is the Haruspex, which ,. It means it’s someone who reads the entrails of birds. , It’s a niche job.,Very niche.,Oh, yeah. It’s very unusual. So I think it’s always helpful to lean into narrative pressure points — anchor points of reality. You have the scene with Philo’s boss saying “give me your badge.” It’s in that kind of cliché where the audience gets the reassurance of, “Yes, there are a lot of weird things happening in this world, but I can follow this story. It’s going to lean into certain archetypes.” I think including that sort of familiarity helps with the newness of it. ,It’s like the fairy tale creatures. Everybody has in the back of their mind the idea of fauns as lecherous forest creatures or fairies as deceitful shape-shifters. So what we’ve done in this world is make all those archetypal fairy tale ideas become the racist stereotypes humans have. So we’re not fighting the audience. We’re leaning into all the stories they’ve heard. We’ve just recontextualized them.,[,] It would have been great to get Jane, but she was unavailable for various reasons. But one of the things we love about the show is that it takes you to all these different places. It’s several different shows, and one of those is this Victorian romance. It was never really part of the original feature script I wrote, which was very focused on Philo and Vignette. But in expanding the story, we had to think about the whole world, and what other characters we’d meet. That was probably the most fun new thing to add because that was one corner of the world I never got to explore in the feature version.,Obviously, we want a really diverse cast, so we tried to be blind about it. But in the case of Agreus, given the grounded nature of his dilemma — a minority who’s moved into an upper-class neighborhood — we didn’t want to put that problem in a white guy’s mouth, to put it bluntly. We definitely wanted to be diverse with that role., David [Gyasi] is amazing. He completely transforms. ,I did a pilot at Fox ages ago, and he actually came about within a breath of playing the lead in it. I was extremely impressed with him. And his audition was amazing. I was texting everybody, “Oh my god, David Gyasi read. You gotta watch it.” I’m gratified I got to work with him. ,He’s a really thoughtful actor about the historical context, as well as the context within the story. So he’s enormously helpful, going into scenes, just giving us feedback, and his perspective that he brings based on his own life experiences. , Yeah, the makeup effects on the show done by a genius named Nick Dudman. He’s a legend in this field. He worked on the ,movies, and ,. And he designed Jack Nicholson’s prosthetic for the Joker in ,. So he is literally the perfect person to do this show, and he’s constantly inventive.,In season 2, we’re going to literally double the number of fantasy creatures we see on the show. And Nick has not only created these creatures, but also gone back to figure out better ways to do the fairy wings and the application of the puck horns. He’s constantly coming up with new and different ideas, both in terms of the creative, but also in terms of delivery. ,Nick is our Q. He’s an incredible engineer, as well as an artist. He’s scaling all this for television because TV moves at a certain pace. It’s very different from movies, and Nick is very cognizant of that. , We’re looking at different varieties of pucks and fairies — different horn shapes and different wing shapes, races within races. But beyond that, you’re going to get some creatures that are our version of elves, and some creatures that would be goblin-like, and a host of other things. The menagerie of the world is really going to expand in season 2, quite a lot., Great. We have a very extensive pre-prep period, and we’re just about done with all eight scripts for the second season, and we don’t even start production until the end of September. So we’re very, very far ahead of the curve, which is, quite frankly, where we like to be, and how you need to do a show of this size. , Yeah, we liked it. We structured season 1 as an eight-chapter novel because we noticed that some short-order shows are structured like a movie where it’s a three-act structure. Travis and I found the middle of the season tends to lag a little bit on those shows. With our approach, in the middle is when everything really ramps up and changes. So it’s allowed for us to tell a story where every episode is impactful, and every episode is chockfull of big moments and character reveals. , We’re dimly aware, at the periphery, that the buzz and the enthusiasm is starting to grow., I’ve had some experience with fandom, and I think when the tone of the discourse is positive, it’s a wonderful thing. Because it really makes television fun and interactive. We’re writing so far ahead of when we are dropping the episodes that there’s simply no way to react to what the fans are liking or not liking. But as we start to roll out the show, it definitely started to dawn on us that this is the kind of show that that’s designed for people who go to Comic-Con. And the response there was terrific., At the end of season 1, all of our characters are in completely different circumstances than they started the show. And that also includes the Burge itself. The change the city goes through in the eighth and final episode is so seismic that it really sets off season 2. It would not be possible to tell the story that we’re telling in season 2 without that change., The political angle is going to be explored a different way. The one thing we’re looking at is never exactly duplicating what’s happening in the real world — not doing an , kind of analogue where it’s one-to-one this-to-that, but creating a situation that seems to be speaking to the real world. One of the most challenging things about concocting the political trajectory for season 2 is we don’t just want to do, “Oh, who’s our Donald Trump?” Instead, we want to tackle the issues that are currently in the real world, but in our own way, in a way that’s true to the characters we’ve set up., We might have a questionable political leader who is vastly unqualified for the job he holds. You can draw your own conclusions from that."

It’s basically ,, with some connective tissue in between.,I wish the show would feel more confident about just how good it is at these sequences, though. Far too often, it’s worried about making anything and everything tense. Dramatic music pumps in during conversations that’d be more tense without it, and it sneaks in at quiet moments when it’s not at all needed. I just want it to leave us with the conversations.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,I think you all know what to expect here, so instead, I’m going to recommend that you watch , to see just how much styles have changed and remember just how young Will Smith used to be.

Co-produced by Blumhouse founder Jason Blum, the satirical thriller was , by distributor Universal Pictures after right-wing pundits slammed the film’s trailer, saying it appeared to endorse the idea of wealthy liberal elites stalking and killing salt-of-the-earth middle-American conservatives.,Amid the furor, Blumhouse quietly announced that its , had been renewed for another season. These two bits of cultural news aren’t entirely unrelated: they both indicate the possible future for gritty genre movies and Blumhouse’s place as their champion., hasn’t gotten a lot of media attention, but it’s been a sporadically worthwhile project. It’s mostly lacking must-see highs, but also only occasionally a waste of time. Ostensibly a horror anthology, , has been distinguished from its competition by three twists: the episodes have been released monthly instead of weekly, each episode is a feature film, and each is loosely inspired by something seasonal. The January episode takes place at a New Year’s party, the April episode is about April Fools’ Day, and so on.,The show’s first season is ending with ,, which is set on Daughter’s Day (September 22nd, for those who haven’t already marked their calendars). The episode offers a pretty typical , mix of well-worn horror concepts and fresh social commentary. The story follows a group of teenage girls who join their fathers at a weekend religious retreat where they’re expected to reaffirm their vows of chastity. But then a rebellious camper pulls her cabinmates into a ritual to conjure up Adam’s first wife, Lilith, a mischievous spirit in the vein of Candyman or Beetlejuice. The spirit they draw wreaks havoc among the pious chauvinists who run the program. , is well-acted, with some moments of mordant wit. But it proceeds almost exactly as expected, which has been a recurring stumbling block for this series.,The best ,episodes aren’t beholden to any particular house style, nor have they followed any predictable pattern. They’ve been more like smart, quirky, low-budget indie films, the kinds that would pop up in a Midnight Madness program at a high-profile film festival.,For example, that January episode, ,, was directed and co-written by Sophia Takal, a former mumblecore indie movie star who previously directed the edgy 2016 thriller ,. , is about a group of women, once childhood friends, who spend an evening trying (and mostly failing) to punish the group’s most successful member for the awful ways she behaved when they were kids. The episode has its violence, but it’s more of a psychodrama with a real edge and a personal touch.,Anyone who wants to sample the best of , could start with that episode. Also very good: ,, a quasi-comedy about a killer costumed character, directed by cult favorite Nacho Vigalondo. One of the few episodes to get some substantial press coverage was the Independence Day special ,, an unnerving Mexican border-crossing story about a pregnant immigrant stumbling into a surreal American suburbia where the smiling faces mask dark intentions.,As for the worst? Well, it’s hard to recommend ,, which is about an assassin schlepping a corpse around a Halloween party. It has a clever premise, but it’s too talky and not as funny or as tense as it should be. Also misbegotten: ,, which squanders a truly nifty premise about a geneticist who creates human clones for her sociopathic son to slaughter. ,, a combination of , and any generic slasher picture, has nothing notable to say about high school or masked murderers.,The least successful ,installments feel perfunctory, a compendium of horror clichés strung together to complete an assignment. That’s a problem because there’s no shortage of horror options these days: on television, in theaters, on streaming services, or (and this is key) on VOD. This may be why , has had such a hard time generating buzz: the series is a little betwixt and between in terms of its format.,Even hardcore gorehounds have a hard time keeping up with all the micro-budgeted slice-’em-ups popping up on digital retailers every week.

Some have gone the miniseries route, like , or the recently canceled ,. Some have worked in a short-story format, like the , or ,, which has occasionally featured ,.,Nearly all of these series have trafficked in undisguised social commentary, too.

Would there have been an outcry over , trailer and its thoughts on immigration?,What’s so fascinating about the , experiment, for better or worse, is that it blurs the lines between movies and TV in ways that are oddly clarifying. Television episodes look more and more “cinematic” these days, such that telling stories in a visually stylish way isn’t enough to make even an actual movie (like the ,episodes) , like a movie. Also, because there are so many movies available to watch these days across many different platforms, a TV franchise pumping out what amounts to a feature film a month isn’t as enticing as it might’ve once been. If anything, the , episodes sometimes feel bloated, like any other overlong episode of prestige cable dramas.,And yet it seems increasingly like TV (or streaming services delivered via televisions, like Netflix and Hulu) is the medium where more disturbing material can find backers and, eventually, viewers as well. It’s just necessary for that material to stand out. Series like , have a platform, a dedicated horror audience looking for something unfamiliar and new, and an opportunity to take big chances. These series have the opportunity to tell subversive, gripping stories that wouldn’t necessarily find funding or promotional support in theaters. And , isn’t taking enough advantage of its freedom. Even the best installments of the show’s first season often came across like still more modestly budgeted VOD movies, made to be forgotten. It remains to be seen whether season 2 can be more confident, more challenging, and more memorable."

HBO is reportedly turning George R.R. Martin’s worst book into a Game of Thrones spinoff,"

A new report , claims that a second prequel series — this time based on , — is nearing a pilot order. , finally ended earlier this year, but HBO was already hard at work on proposals for no fewer than five prequel and spinoff ideas before the hot takes from the final season had even finished cooling. ,We already know what one of those proposals is: a prequel set thousands of years before the original show and books in the “Golden Age of Heroes,” created by Jane Goldman and series author George R.R. Martin, which shot a pilot episode earlier this summer. Back in May (just before the original show ended), , that two more of the ideas were still in play and “edging closer” to something more concrete, suggesting that “maybe some of you should pick up a copy of , says that the new ,series is a second attempt at adapting the novel from Martin and , co-creator Ryan Condal, following an initial attempt by , to adapt that novel that ,.,is certainly... a choice for a , show. Unlike the Goldman series (tentatively referred to by Martin as ,), , chronicles the 300 years directly preceding the events of ,. It starts with Aegon the Conqueror, the first Targaryen king of Westeros who conquered Westeros with his siblings, and it goes all the way through Aerys II, the Mad King, who , fans will recognize as Daenerys’ father and the last of the Targaryen kings.,There are a few issues with ,, the book, however. The first is that it’s unfinished; Martin has only written the first of two planned volumes in the series, which covers from Aegon I though the next 157 years of the dynasty. (The rule of Aegon III, the last Targaryen ruler to have living dragons until Daenerys, would come along another 150 or so years later.) And as anyone who watched the end of , now knows, ,.,But the bigger issue is that ,is , The book is written as an in-universe historical tome, allegedly written by Archmaester Gyldayn, and it’s styled after Edward Gibbon’s ,which is a wonderful historical set (or so I’m told) but not exactly entertaining reading. It is also 700 pages long, making the experience of reading it similar to that of slogging through a college history textbook, except none of it is real, ,This isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker for a television adaption. The events of ,are, in theory, thrilling: Aegon’s dragon-fueled conquests, succession crises, a dragon versus dragon Targaryen civil war called “The Dance of Dragons.” But HBO will have to make some considerable changes in style and tone from the dry-as-dust book if it wants to make compelling television. There’s also the issue that the later years of the dynasty (which, again, Martin has yet to write) obviously butts up against the current series in the sort of unnecessary prequel style that , the ,. ,There’s also the far longer time period, although that could be managed if HBO takes more of an anthology approach. A , show could, for example, adapt one monarch’s reign in one season and then jump ahead in time to the next. Such a strategy could also help the network avoid ballooning actor salaries that helped , become one of the most expensive shows that ever aired. ,All of this is still in the early stages. ,’s report only notes that a pilot may be nearing an order, which isn’t a guarantee of any sort. And even if a pilot is shot, there’s no promise that HBO will actually move forward with a full series. But with Martin attached to the pitch, an actual book to work off of, and the sheer amount of money involved in the , brand, it wouldn’t be at all surprising if , ends up on our TV screens in a few years.

Amazon Video’s animated series Undone could be the start of something amazing,"

        ",Samantha Nelson,"When Alma, the sharp-witted, deeply troubled protagonist of Amazon Prime’s new animated series , dresses as Dorothy for Halloween at age eight, her physicist father Jacob admits he doesn’t understand ,. “You’ve got this girl Dorothy, right?” he asks. “She’s living a normal boring life, and she gets a chance to live an exciting life, and all she wants to do is go home. If you had a chance to do something amazing, would you just want everything to return to normal?” ,Jacob doesn’t know it, but his argument gets some strong support from the film’s unofficial sequel, ,, where Dorothy insists her adventures in another world were real, so her aunt and uncle commit her to an asylum for electroshock therapy. Like that movie, ,, which releases on September 13th, repeatedly makes it clear that living an exciting life can come with a terrible price.,Jacob (Bob Odenkirk of ,and ,) dies in a car accident that Halloween, after leaving Alma (Rosa Salazar of ,) alone so he can tend to some mysterious crisis involving his work. Alma has never really gotten over it. She lives like a sleepwalker until she gets into her own near-fatal car crash. Jacob appears to her in the hospital to tell her that the trauma has awakened a latent ability to become unstuck in time, a power he thinks she can use to prevent his death. Alma’s grandmother was schizophrenic, but Jacob insists his mother actually had the same power as Alma and was just misunderstood. Through more than half of the show (five of the series’ 22-minute episodes were provided for advance review), , pointedly avoids addressing whether Alma’s ability is real or she’s experiencing a mental breakdown.,employs rotoscoping, a technique where animators trace over live footage, for a smooth but surreal effect. Richard Linklater used rotoscoping to give ,its dreamlike quality and ,its psychedelic feel. ,creators Raphael Bob-Waksberg and Kate Purdy use the technique in , to convey a sense of unreality, contrasting Alma’s fairly mundane life of working at a daycare and fighting with her sister Becca (Angelique Cabral) and mother Camila (Constance Marie) with the vivid cosmic planes and fantastic forests she visits when using her powers. Animation studio Submarine used oil paintings to produce these backdrops, and it’s incredibly startling when Alma’s regular surroundings, like her hospital room or home, are torn away and replaced with those more vibrant spaces. The show quickly establishes a sense that anything can happen at any time.,Alma’s trips through time feel like an extension of the work Bob-Waksberg and Purdy did as the creator and writer-producer of ,, where the title character has on occasion lost time and simply found himself in new scenes, due to his perpetual drug use. Alma skips backward and forward in time, letting the writers weave in flashbacks that explore her family life, but also jump forward to events that won’t occur in real time for several episodes. The technique is similar to the time-travel thriller ,, but the narrative is much easier to parse, thanks to the guiding hand Jacob provides in telling Alma — through her, the audience — what’s going on and why.,As with ,, Bob-Waksberg and Purdy have shown a remarkable ability to pack each episode with dark drama, sharp comedy, and touching interplay between well-developed characters. The dynamic between Alma and Jacob is something between father and daughter, and Jedi master and Padawan. For every goofy moment where Alma gently ribs her dad or backpedals in a story to impress him instead of telling him the truth, there’s one where he urges her to avoid all other relationships so she can focus on her powers and his mission. That myopic focus would be disturbing even if it wasn’t possible that he’s just some complex delusion pulling Alma away from her living family.,BoJack and Alma share a lot of similarities, with complicated relationships with their families and a desire to use comedy to cover up their inner anguish. In the first episode, “The Crash,” Alma’s mom asks her to bleach her upper lip ahead of a dinner celebrating Becca’s engagement to her mayonnaise-bland but rich boyfriend, Reed Hollingsworth (regular ,guest star Kevin Bigley). Alma instead pencils a curly mustache on her lip. She often goes on political rants, and she out calls people around her on their hypocrisy with a contemptuousness that makes her feel like a hybrid between BoJack and Aubrey Plaza. But the tenderness Alma lets herself show when calming down a rambunctious kid at daycare or genuinely apologizing to Becca gives her a relatable, sympathetic quality that BoJack typically lacks.,While traveling through time, Alma retreads not only her own memories, but those of the people closest to her. Seeing those other perspectives produces a radical empathy similar to what the consciousness-sharing characters experience in the Wachowski sisters’ Netflix series ,. Alma gets to reconnect with her younger sister by reliving how much Becca once idolized her as a child, and she finds a new respect for her practical mother by learning that there was a lot she didn’t know about her more imaginative father. But the most touching example comes from a fight between Alma and her boyfriend Sam (Siddharth Dhananjay). Sharing his memories, she comes to understand his fears of losing her, as she explores the isolation he’s felt as an Indian immigrant.,Alma is mostly deaf, though she can hear with the help of a cochlear implant. That just adds to the show’s focus on the subjective nature of perception, as the audio gets a muffled, submerged quality whenever Alma removes the external portion of her implant. The subtitles laying out her lip-reading are missing words to make it clear her comprehension isn’t perfect. It’s a jarring effect, particularly since Alma occasionally removes the device with the explicit intention of tuning the rest of the world out so she can focus on her increasingly strange inner life.,Adult Western animation has traditionally leaned on the absurdist comedy popularized in Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim block. , is filled with ridiculous wordplay and jokes about its cast of animal people, but it uses that humor to lure viewers in before stunning them with deeply dramatic portraits of despair. It feels like Bob-Waksberg and Purdy built a similar bridge to get to the more powerful elements in ,, which could have easily been a live-action science-fiction drama with hourlong episodes.,But the short episodes keep the narrative tight and mysterious, a technique that worked well for Amazon’s psychological thriller ,. And the animation removes any limits on its visual ambitions. ,’s rotoscoped style can be off-putting and startling, thanks to the shifting spaces and breaks with reality. The nonlinear storytelling and unreliable protagonist add to the sense that there’s no solid narrative ground to stand on here, which can be disconcerting. But the show’s combination of old animated technology and its fresh approach to serialized science fiction is appealingly ambitious and powerful. If this series helps mark a new wave of American adult animation, it,could be the start of something truly amazing."

Why Netflix’s Derry Girls is the perfect show to stream this weekend,"
          Aug  2, 2019, 10:00am EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,The first episode of ,, a sitcom created by Northern Irish playwright Lisa McGee for Britain’s Channel 4. Based loosely on McGee’s experiences growing up in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, in the early 1990s, in the waning years of the sectarian violence familiarly dubbed “the Troubles,” the show acknowledges the era’s mounting tensions while also telling lighthearted, hilariously profane stories about teens being teens. The first episode — titled “Episode One” — introduces the cast of Catholic schoolgirls. Saoirse-Monica Jackson plays Erin, an intensely self-conscious youngster who is stuck rooming with her weirdo cousin Orla (Louisa Harland). The two are pals with the skittish Clare (Nicola Coughlan) and the cocky Michelle (Jamie-Lee O’Donnell). At the start of a new school year, Michelle has been saddled with her own cousin, James (Dylan Llewellyn), an English kid assigned to be the first male to attend the all-girls Our Lady Immaculate College. (The authorities are afraid he’ll be beaten up at a boys’ school.),Because ,’ second season has just been made available in its entirety on Netflix.,Not enough Netflix subscribers know about the delight that is ,, a fast-paced, funny show that packs a lot of snappy dialogue and adolescent antics into each 22-minute installment, mixed with some rich period detail. In the second of the series’s six-episode seasons, the kids from Our Lady Immaculate scramble to get concert tickets and make plans for a prom — typical teenage business. But they also attend a symbolic peacemaking summit with a Protestant school, and they look forward to a state visit by President Bill Clinton, in hopes the US can help stabilize the region.,Season 1’s first episode establishes ,’ 1990s milieu, with its references to Macaulay Culkin and ,. But its most telling sign of the times comes with the opening image of soldiers in an armored vehicle, rolling through the Londonderry streets while the Cranberries’ “Dreams” plays on the soundtrack. Within the first minutes of episode 1, Erin’s family is hearing reports about an unexploded bomb on the bridge that leads to the school, and they’re wondering whether that day’s classes will be canceled.,At the same time, the world-weary tone the characters take to the Troubles is an immediate tip-off that ,won’t be too heavy. (Orla’s mother, on finding out that a potential explosion might keep her from hitting the tanning bed, grumbles, “I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m not enjoying this bomb.”) The political situation is just context. A more common moment for the show is when Erin’s mother won’t let her wear a denim jacket to the school instead of the Our Lady Immaculate uniform blazer. When the denim-jacketed Clare sees Erin has wussed out on their planned wardrobe switch, she quickly takes hers off too, saying, “I’m not being individual on my own!” That sort of wry humor is what , is all about. ,Fans of comedies about unruly women.,In the early 1990s, British comedian Jennifer Saunders wrote and starred in the bawdy sitcom ,, about an aging libertine and her equally wasted best friend, still trying to live like hip 20-year-olds well into their 40s. The show was enormously influential, inspiring a wave of American TV shows (like ,, ,, and ,) about ladies inclined to overindulge in everything from sex to intoxicants to the latest luxury goods. That spirit lives on in series like the Pop Channel’s current ,, where the wanton women aren’t rich, but they also aren’t letting minor setbacks like probation and unpaid bills keep them from enjoying wild times.,Similarly, the girls in , don’t let restrictive nuns or bomb threats keep them from swearing, fighting, and lusting after boys. (At least they don’t smoke, although Orla does carry a lighter because, as she says, “I just like meltin’ stuff.”) Much of the first episode is about the ladies getting sent to after-school detention for threatening to beat up an annoyingly unflappable first-year student — an offense Michelle insists was merely “, bullying,” unworthy of punishment. The big appeal of this show is that these characters’ self-centered concerns feel so real. There are bombs in the streets, but they’re more upset when a nun confiscates a lipstick that’s been discontinued. Whether viewers are willing to admit it, this kind of “But how does this affect ,?” tunnel vision is honestly relatable.,Netflix.

        ",Julia Alexander,"Disney is having a record run at the box office this year, surpassing $8 billion in global ticket sales thanks to an astounding run of blockbuster releases across its Marvel and core Disney brands. That said, the company is gearing up to expand that success well beyond the theater, and with that comes big spending. In its fiscal third quarter earning results for 2019, the company posted revenue of $20.25 billion, coming in under Wall Street estimates of $21 billion. ,“I’d like to congratulate The Walt Disney Studios for reaching $8 billion at the global box office so far this year — a new industry record — thanks to the stellar performance of our Marvel, Pixar and Disney films,” CEO Bob Iger , release this afternoon. “The incredible popularity of Disney’s brands and franchises positions us well as we launch Disney+, and the addition of original and library content from Fox will only further strengthen our direct-to-consumer offerings.” ,The missed targets came from higher operating costs associated with the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, full ownership of Hulu, and the investment in its upcoming streaming service Disney+, according to the report. Despite that, Iger told investors on a call that “we remain confident in our ability to maximize our strategy” following the acquisition. Most of Disney’s divisions saw an increase in sales, including its media networks (like cable and broadcast television) and, of course, studio entertainment. This most recent quarter alone saw the studio entertainment division’s revenue increase 33 percent to $3.8 billion. ,Disney’s momentum at the box office has been unprecedented in 2019. ,marked the company’s first big release of 2019, and , upon its release.

Disney may find that momentum again in 2021, when ,is scheduled to come out. ,The company’s focus heading into next year isn’t necessarily beating its current theatrical milestone, though. It’s Disney+, ,. ,Disney+ is one of the company’s biggest undertakings in recent years, with the company spending billions of dollars on acquiring majority stakes in ,, which provided the technical backbone of HBO Now and the WWE Network, in order to ensure the product is up to snuff. ,Disney is also about to enter an extremely oversaturated market. Netflix is still the leading company in direct-to-consumer streaming, but there are new entries coming from ,. Disney, which ,, is looking to compete by offering its exclusive library of films and TV shows. It’s also pricing its offering as one of the cheapest options yet, at $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year. ,The goal is to try to salvage cord-cutting customers by getting them to sign up for Disney+ on the promise of an expansive backlog and exclusive new shows and films. The company is ,, although there are few details about what that bundle will look like. Iger previously told investors that he thinks Disney+ can attract ,, which is approximately 20 percent of Netflix’s current US subscriber base. ,Disney may be readying itself for a leap into digital, but that doesn’t mean its impressive theatrical run is over. Disney has at least two more major releases this year — , and ,, the final installment in the current , trilogy. Both films are expected to do astronomical numbers at the box office, and both could cross the $1 billion line with ease. If they do, Disney could break another record: the first studio to cross $10 billion at the box office in a single year. "

Netflix’s Wu Assassins series lacks the Hong Kong cinema magic,"
          Aug  8, 2019, 11:43am EDT
        ",Noah Berlatsky,"The first episode of Netflix’s ,opens with a kinetic, preposterous, thoroughly enjoyable Hong Kong cinema throwback fight scene set in a series of halls and stairwells. Railings are hurdled, bullets are dodged, people are pinned to walls with their own knives. It’s a ballet of violence set to over-carbonated electronic music, culminating with the hero snatching a thrown knife out of the air. “Who are you?” the man he’s rescued asks in wonder. “I’m a chef,” he quips. End scene, cue applause. It’s everything fans want in a retro martial arts flick.,But after five minutes or so, it’s done — and then, alas, the plot kicks in.,That plot manages to be both predictable and nonsensical. Aspiring chef Kai Jin (played by celebrated stuntman Iko Uwais) is trying to get his food-truck business off the ground while occasionally working at the restaurant of his romantic interest Jenny (Li Jun Li). Then he discovers he’s the heir to mystical martial arts powers. He must use them to defeat a bunch of villains with elemental magic, including his adoptive father, Uncle Six (Byron Mann), the leader of a criminal triad. In addition, the show desperately but ineffectually wants viewers to be interested in the undercover work of blond white cop C.G. (Katheryn Winnick) who’s trying to prevent a gang war between the triad and crime boss Alec McCullough (Tommy Flanagan).,Genre fans of various flavors have seen this all before: the father / son tension between Kai and Uncle Six, the assassin who doesn’t want to be a killer, the magical visitor who tells the reluctant chosen one he’s chosen. Even the mystical out-of-time training sequences and visions of the future are so rote that they spark resigned acquiescence instead of wonder. ,The most frustrating part of ,, though, is its straight-faced grimness. The clichés, plot holes, and stilted dialogue would all be forgivable if there were more fight scenes, and if the show wasn’t so often soaked in its own sodden seriousness.,Martial arts cinema has a tradition of light-hearted absurdity, from Jackie Chan’s adorably corny clowning to Stephen Chow’s hyperbolic camp masterpieces. Even John Woo has been known to punch through seriousness and on into giddy bombast in films like ,, where Nicolas Cage and John Travolta teeter on the edge of self-parody, and then gleefully jump off that edge, guns blazing.,On film, some Americans have captured those high spirits, as ,and ,demonstrate. But recent American tributes to Hong Kong television tend to treat the genre as if it’s an exercise in heartfelt blather and tragic backstories. Netflix’s ,, like the other Marvel Netflix shows, largely abandoned the humor of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in favor of a gritty, downbeat landscape of dimly lit hallways, furrowed brows, and supposedly intense monologues. Even the action sequences were badly handled. AMC’s ,did better with the fights, but its dystopic-future setting is still mired in drearily convoluted plot machinations. The stunt performers spin, jump, and kick with weightless improvisatory brilliance, then pass the baton to the actors, who immediately sink into a bog of melodrama. ,is better than ,if only because Uwais is a better lead than Finn Jones. But the show’s acting is weaker than ,, and its writing is even worse. The writing issues could actually be a strength if the showrunners were willing to lean into their inadequacies. The first three episodes available for preview are filled with scenes that could function as enjoyable punchlines, if only the tone weren’t so deadeningly dour. ,For example, in one sequence, a physically unimposing woman suddenly turns out to have amazing martial arts abilities, which is exactly the sort of setup that Stephen Chow staged in films like ,with a high-octane wink. But in ,,,the reveal is set in a drug-addicts’ hovel, and it’s played completely straight, with all the fun drained out of it. In another Chow-esque conceit, Kai’s powers make him transform into an old bald guy when he does martial arts. So the triad decides to kidnap every bald chef in Chinatown, which should obviously cue the apocalyptic battle of the bald chefs! Instead, the show just gathers a bunch of bald chefs in a room, then has them leave.,In another sequence, C.G. explains that she never listens to music in cars because her father was arrested while listening to Kiss at high volumes on his car stereo. It’s an egregiously bone-headed version of the trope whereby all characters in action dramas must have a secret pain in their pasts; she might as well have said that her parents were kidnapped and murdered by background music. But again, this seemingly ridiculous detail is presented without any joy or flair. Kai expresses no incredulity, and barely any interest. He was apparently expecting a tearful tale of dead fathers when he casually asked why he couldn’t turn on the car radio.,Kai’s profession is also a wasted opportunity. Perhaps the best non-fight sequence in the first three episodes is a montage of Kai and Jenny preparing a meal in the restaurant. They chop, they spice, they flame, they flirt. The choreographed moves around the kitchen act as a nod to the choreographed battles. Watching the dance-like food preparation, it’s possible to see the outlines of an alternate ,which really embraced a love of food, with Kai making complicated dishes in every episode and explaining each recipe and how to prepare it. Reality TV cooking shows and martial arts dramas are both built around delicious, kinetic setpieces. Why not combine them in a single dish? ,The reason we can’t combine them in a single dish is obvious enough. Show creators John Wirth and Tony Krantz don’t have an adventurous palate or, for that matter, a sense of humor. Hong Kong martial arts cinema at its best is exhilarating because of its sense of possibility — watching those movies means feeling that bodies can do anything. Recent American television adaptations like ,, though, are stuck in their own solemnity, so eager to pay sincere tribute that they trudge where they should leap and gesture ineffectually where they should instead unleash their deadly ,. At some point, the age of peak television should unleash a show with great martial arts , an entertaining story. ,does pretty well with the first, so viewers may want to fast-forward to the fight scenes. Even with the power of the Wu Assassin, though, sitting through the whole series may be an almost impossible challenge."

        ",Andrew Liptak,"The , spy franchise has been a solid action vehicle for actor Matt Damon, and over the years, Universal Pictures has experimented with trying to turn it into a bigger franchise. Its latest attempt is a TV show called ,, and the first trailer just hit the web today. ,The series will debut on USA this October, and the trailer shows off all of the requisite hand-to-hand action scenes, car chases, and glimpses of documents the CIA really should have shredded years ago. The show looks as though it’s aimed at building out the world we first saw in , as they discover they’re uncannily good at getting in and out of fights but are conditioned to not remember their training. From the teaser, it looks like someone’s going through the trouble of tracking them down to “wake” them up. ,Back in July, USA released a brief announcement teaser with the show’s characters: sleeper agents, SoYun Pak (Han Hyo-Joo) and J. Randolph Bentley (Jeremy Irvine), as well as Petra (Emilia Schüle), a Russian KGB agent. , as a CIA agent. ,The first , film introduced a solid action film concept: a secret program called Operation Treadstone trained soldiers to be the perfect assassins, with the unfortunate consequence that it sometimes left them unstable and prone to mental health issues. In Jason Bourne’s case, that meant dissociative amnesia. ,It’s a good framework on paper, but we’ll have to see how well it scales up outside of the Matt Damon-led series. He kicked off the franchise with , in 2002 and followed up with three sequels: 2004’s ,2007’s ,and 2016’s ,When Damon opted not to return for a fourth film, Jeremy Renner filled in, playing another agent caught up in the drama in ,, which never lived up to its predecessors.,The franchise seems to have fizzled out a bit since then, although various people involved have made the obligatory pledge that they’d be interested to return if they can get the right story. This latest group of actors isn’t quite as well-known as Damon, so we’ll have to see if they can take his place on-screen.,With ,, it seems Universal is ready to try again, this time on TV. ,, and it’ll apparently go into the origins and present happenings of the clandestine government program. There’s certainly an appetite for action-oriented spy thrillers: Amazon released , last year, an adaptation of the Tom Clancy character that recently received a modern surge in popularity. Amazon also debuted ,, a TV series based on the 2011 film, which also follows a super-assassin. "
"Preacher is unwatched, unloved, and doomed — but Tulip O’Hare goes on","
          Aug 14, 2019, 11:42am EDT
        ",Noah Berlatsky,"In the fourth and final season of AMC’s comic book adaptation ,, tough female lead Tulip O’Hare (Ruth Negga) is subjected to a Rorschach test psych evaluation. She tries her best to pass it, looking at each image and eagerly describing the grisly murders she sees in every inkblot. After she’s done, her kind doctor nervously explains, “The test results indicate that you’re an uninhibited deviant with a personality disorder prone to psychopathic outbursts. And a gun fetish. And unresolved abandonment issues.”,Tulip, who was painfully hopeful when talking about disembowelments and headshots a moment earlier, sinks into herself and acknowledges that the diagnosis fits. When the doctor tries to comfort her, she just gives him a sad little smile, like she’s trying to cheer him up. “It’s okay. Some people can’t be helped.”,The scene feels like a Monty Python skit with a heart, a lovely encapsulation of why , has been such a wonderful show. It may also explain why the series has been largely ignored by critics and gradually abandoned by viewers. The setup for this scene — Tulip’s preposterous, hyperbolic blood-and-brains reactions to a simple association test — is an absurdist sketch comedy gag. But Negga is so fully committed to the bit that it doesn’t feel like a cheap punchline. It’s more like she’s coming to terms with the joke that is her life. Her combination of cynicism and sincerity, of ironically fantastic narrative and natural, nuanced acting, seems almost designed to alienate every potential audience., is based on the famously profane Garth Ennis / Steve Dillon Vertigo comic about small-town Texas preacher Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) who’s inhabited by Genesis, the most powerful entity in the universe. Genesis gives Jesse the power of command, meaning he can make anyone who’s listening to his voice do whatever he says. Angry about how messed-up the world is, Jesse sets off on a quest with his girlfriend Tulip to find God and make him explain himself.,The comic was an exercise in blasphemous nastiness, and over four seasons, the television show has taken that foul baton and gleefully run with it. The first season ends with virtually every character dying in a giant fecal explosion when the safety systems malfunction at a pig shit management facility. One person who escapes is named Arseface (Ian Colletti) because his face, badly disfigured after a botched suicide attempt, looks like a giant anus. Meanwhile, God (Mark Harelik) has come to earth to listen to jazz and participate in unspecified sex acts while wearing a full-body dog fetish suit. In the fourth season, the gross-out humor doesn’t let up. Jesse’s vampire friend Cassidy (Joseph Gilgun) is captured and tortured by having his foreskin repeatedly removed. (Vampires regenerate.) The foreskin is then processed, packaged, and sold as a high-end anti-aging cream., stages these kinds of nasty setpieces with a joyfully mean-spirited inventiveness. A recent episode opens with a pitch-perfect ad for that Cassidy-foreskin cream, complete with fashion-shoot gowns and a cutesy tagline. Asked what the secret for young skin is, the model whispers, “I’ll never tell.” Cut to Cassidy screaming as a machine like a grocery meat cutter circumcises him over and over. (Yes, there’s a shot of the bloody bits getting bagged up.),In the comic, Jesse is a fairly typical tough guy with a code; he’s a sympathetic cowboy hero. In the television show, though, he’s a religious megalomaniac who is convinced of his divine destiny. He’s also a jealous, controlling boyfriend. He’s not very sympathetic. And that means that the main focus of identification in the series shifts to Cass and Tulip, who ends up trying to come to Cassidy’s rescue as Jesse, characteristically, skips out to pursue his own quest.,Gilgun is wonderful as Cassidy. He doesn’t play the vampire as a lovable rogue, but as someone pretending to be a lovable rogue. His true self-periodically shows through, with flashes of sadness, confusion, and murderous self-loathing. But Negga really steals the series. Strong female characters are generally unflappable badasses. Alternately, they go the ,route, showing their vulnerability by agonizing about whether their strength makes them abnormal or unfeminine.,Tulip is different, though. She loves to fight and break things. She’s confident in her ability to beat the tar out of any antagonist. But at the same time, she’s deeply insecure about her own judgment and lovability. Her uncertainty and self-mistrust are subtly tied to racism. Jesse’s family despised Tulip’s, and that rejection still rankles. Also, Tulip’s father was killed by the police. She’s the product of a society that has sent her the lifelong message that she’s no good and that all her projects and dreams will end in failure.,Tulip has internalized that message, and she could easily succumb to despair. Negga lets the audience see her thinking about it. When Jesse leaves her, she’s not angry at him (as she should be), but at herself for failing him. Her anger and sadness are turned inward; she thinks she’s gotten what she deserves. But her reaction to despair, inevitably, is to pick herself up and do whatever she thinks is right anyway. She may be useless and unlovable, but she can still love, and she can still be a hero.,Of course, her plans don’t work as they’re supposed to. Cassidy is also a messed-up mass of insecurity, and when Tulip tries to rescue him, he kneecaps every attempt. But that doesn’t mean Tulip’s goals are misguided or wrong. In season 3, God himself (wearing that dog costume) tells her she’s a fuck-up. She thinks about it for a moment and responds that he better get out of her face or she’ll kick his ass. It’s false bravado, perhaps, but God does look nervous. After all, the world is just absurd enough that maybe she could do it.,’s absurdity is deliberate and philosophical. Jesse, Tulip, and Cass fight and drink their way through a world that isn’t just indifferent, but actually malevolent. In season 4, God gratuitously arranges the unlikely death of everyone Jesse tries to help, including cute dogs and children. It’s funny the way Kafka is funny, albeit with more car chases and explosions. Like Sisyphus, the characters go on because they don’t have any choice, but also, perhaps, because they’ve decided that a stone isn’t going to beat them.,In the same way, , the series has made it to a fourth and last season, even though no one seems to be watching it or writing much about it anymore. It’s unclear how the series will wrap, though it’s already obvious that the end will be significantly different from the comic’s conclusion. Will Tulip find happiness, hopefully with someone other than that asshole Jesse? Probably not; this is an unhappy, God-damned world, and it doesn’t hold out much hope or help for anyone. Few television shows acknowledge the bitter things in life with such imaginative humor, and few characters face this kind of cynicism with the two-fisted grace of Tulip O’Hare."

In many ways, the horrors it depicts — lives destroyed by drugs, corporations complicit in that destruction — are more relevant now than they were when the film adaption of Philip K. Dick’s book was initially released.,That also makes the film somewhat harder to watch because it constantly feels like there’s more it could be doing. It’s a lethargic, trippy movie, and while that plays into the theme, it also puts the film’s characters behind a pall. It’s not really clear what anyone’s doing or why, and the minimal plot is far too empty to feel important.,Mostly, the film made me think that there has to be a better use for rotoscoped animation.

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"Amazon’s , might be getting most of the attention around the streaming service’s big-budget fantasy adaptations, but the company has just announced casting for nearly all the key characters in its , doorstop fantasy novel show: ,The show announced its cast for the books’ five central characters: Madeleine Madden as Egwene al’Vere, Marcus Rutherford as Perrin Aybara, Barney Harris as Mat Cauthon, Zoë Robins as Nynaeve al’Meara, and Josha Stradowski as Rand al’Thor. ,Jordan’s original 15-book epic, which puts even the , or , series to shame in terms of sheer page count, largely focuses on these characters.

(She’s a sort of Dumbledore, to continue the , analogy.)

The Boys demonstrates why evil-Superman stories are so popular,"
          Aug 15, 2019, 11:25am EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"In the ,, anti-superhero vigilante Billy Butcher (Karl Urban of the , and ,) comes to Susan Raynor, the deputy director of the CIA, with evidence of a massive corporate conspiracy, and a list of demands in exchange for the information. She’s willing to grant him and his team exorbitant salaries, security clearance, offices, and indemnity, but she refuses to help him in his vendetta against Homelander (Antony Starr), the world’s most powerful superhero.,“It’s suicide,” she tells Billy. “Not for you, for thousands of people if you push him too hard. I’m terrified, and you should be too.”,Homelander is a clear stand-in for Superman, gifted with near invulnerability, X-ray vision, laser eyes, and flight, powers he uses to publicly fight for America. And Susan’s fear of this Superman figure is nothing new. Red Kryptonite, which has chaotic powers, including the ability to turn Superman evil, made its first appearance in comics in 1958. Superman villains General Zod and Bizarro have both served as dark mirror images of Superman, ways to explore what would happen if his powers were unmoored from his Kansas-grown morality. Even when Superman isn’t overtly evil, he’s often portrayed as ,.,The combination of Superman’s extremely high power levels and traditional rigidly good behavior is what makes the “What if?” scenarios about his ethos so compelling. The , video game and comic book series and the Justice Lords plot from the ,animated series both imagine what would happen if Superman, driven too far, decided the world would be better off with him in charge. Mark Millar’s , has Superman’s rocket land in Ukraine instead of Smallville, leading Superman to become a champion for the Soviet Union.,Each of these stories changes Superman as a way to explore the impact the Man of Steel has on the world, his fellow heroes, and even his villains. For instance, in , Lex Luthor is repainted as a hero, Batman is a Soviet freedom fighter, Wonder Woman is a collaborator in Superman’s tyranny, and Superman’s active participation in the Cold War brings the United States to the brink of collapse. By recognizing how much of a lynchpin Superman is within the DC Comics canon, and how terrifying his powers could be if they were used amorally, writers have been able to tell fascinating stories exploring the motivations and capabilities of the rest of the DC Universe characters.,But Superman isn’t just the most iconic DC hero — he’s one of the most recognizable heroes in the world. That makes it easy for other creators to tell stories about him without tacitly acknowledging the connection, or asking DC’s blessing. Author Brandon Sanderson explored the dichotomy between Superman as a symbol of hope and as a horrible potential threat in his YA novel ,. The book is set in a world where almost all people with superpowers quickly turn evil, but a sect of people wear a stylized S as a sort of holy symbol in hopes that eventually someone resembling the champion imagined by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster will manifest and save them. Steelheart, the book’s titular hero, looks the part, and when he shows up to interrupt a bank robbery at the beginning of the book, the protagonist’s father assumes his prayers have finally been answered. But Steelheart just plans to use his powers to take over Chicago and make sure no one else threatens his dominion.,The , sets up the traditional beats of the Superman origin story, with a kindly childless Kansas couple taking in an alien baby who develops superpowers as he nears puberty. But while Superman’s scientist father Jor-El is typically portrayed as having only the best intentions for his son, the baby in , was sent to Earth to rule it. Mark Waid’s comic book series ,warps Superman’s origin even further — the alien baby in that story is the manifestation of a terribly guilty mother exerting her will on an alien probe, and producing a child she can’t kill. That twisted birth leads ,’s Superman stand-in, the Plutonian, through an unhappy childhood and into uneasy superheroism, until his unforeseen role in a terrible tragedy shatters his psyche and leads him to become a mass murderer.,In both ,and the DC series ,, Waid considers the possibility that smart, paranoid people living in a world with a Superman-caliber hero might not wait around for them to snap. ,centers on Batman’s secret plans on how to neutralize Superman and other key members of the Justice League in case they go rogue. Not coincidentally, one of the first people the Plutonian kills in , is the series’ Batman equivalent.,Fear-driven contingency plans are also at the heart of the plot of the adaptation of ,, which significantly departs from the comics by spending much more time focused on Homelander and his Justice League-style team, the Seven. Starr plays Homelander with the same coldness Christian Bale brought to ,. He presents a charming, folksy exterior that quickly gives way to disturbing malice as he threatens his teammates, expresses his contempt for people without powers, and rips apart his enemies with his eye-beams. ,’ heroes are all deeply flawed, but for the most part, their crimes and failings are driven by understandable motivations, like substance abuse, fear of inadequacy, or greed. Homelander is different. While the world’s other heroes get their powers from corporate experiments, Homelander was one of the company’s first test subjects, and he was raised entirely in a lab. That might be why he’s so powerful, but it’s also left him fundamentally broken, a sociopath with deep mommy issues and grand ambitions. ,When his attempts to stop a plane hijacking leads to the aircraft being damaged, Homelander condemns everyone on board to die rather than saving a few who could share how he failed. He uses Trumpian rhetoric to stir up a crowd at a religious gathering, drawing on fears of the “Deep State” to get them clamoring to put him on the front lines of America’s conflicts abroad. To truly be the greatest hero in the world, he needs supervillains to fight, so he sets about making them by stealing the compound that gives heroes their powers. Each incident takes iconic images of Superman’s heroism and warps them into something terrible — but fundamentally recognizable.,John Vogelbaum (John Doman of ,and ,), the scientist who created Homelander, admits that raising him without parents was a terrible mistake. But in the biggest twist of ,’ first season, it’s revealed that Homelander’s own secret son is being groomed as a weapon against him, a good Superman to stand against Homelander’s evil. With Homelander increasingly unrestricted and mentally unmoored, the question is whether his son can stop him from turning into the mass-murdering tyrant that most dark versions of Superman eventually become.,In one season 1 episode, Wonder Woman equivalent Queen Maeve says, “Everyone always asks what’s our special weakness… The truth is, our weakness is the same as anyone’s. It’s people.” She’s making an argument for why superheroes should cut ties with regular people. But that’s also a reminder that a superhero’s biggest weakness is that they , people. Superman is an iconic hero because he’s honest, just, restrained, and noble. It’s terrifying to imagine that kind of power in the hands of a normal person, who could lose control or patience, or have selfish goals. The fear of an evil Superman is fundamentally an acknowledgement of the evil in every man."

Apple TV Plus will reportedly cost $9.99 per month and launch in November,"

Netflix’s Locke and Key mashes up Riverdale and The Haunting of Hill House,"
          Feb  6, 2020,  2:22pm EST
        ",Andrew Webster," is what would happen if you took the brooding teen drama of , and combined it with the all-too-real family tragedy and otherworldly scares of , , ,. That might make Netflix’s latest series sound derivative. But while it shares a similar tone as other shows on the service — , fans will find a lot to enjoy here — ,’s wildly creative premise gives it its own unique flavor. Yes, it’s dark, magical, and dramatic but in a way you’ve never seen before.,The show is based on the decade-old comic series of the same name by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez, and the premise is largely the same. Following the death of her husband, Rendell (Bill Heck), Nina Locke (Darby Stanchfield) packs up her three kids and moves them to an old family home in small-town Massachusetts. That home, called Keyhouse (please don’t dwell too long on the on-the-nose naming conventions) is a sprawling New England estate that also happens to be home to a number of magical keys. Things really pick up when Bode (Jackson Robert Scott), the youngest kid, finds a woman named Dodge trapped in a well on the property who turns out to be some kind of evil demon.,The keys are really — and I’m sorry to say it like this — the key to the whole show. Each has a distinct ability. One can unlock a person’s mind so they can step through a door into a world made up of their thoughts and memories. Another lets people travel anywhere just by unlocking the closest door. One fixes things, one turns people into ghosts, and others control people or trap them in a terrifying mirror world. They have satisfying names like the Anywhere Key and the Head Key. Bode accidentally stumbles onto the keys because they whisper to him; as he explores the house, he can hear them, and once found, he tries to figure out what they do. Eventually, his older siblings join in, and the trio takes control of the keys., is a mystery — actually, it’s a few mysteries, and each intertwines with another. There are the keys themselves, of course: where they came from, why they’re here, what they do. There’s also the murder of the Locke patriarch and, oh yeah, that demon lady living in the well. All of these mysteries are connected in ways I won’t spoil, and they’re layered into a story that’s, at its heart, about family. There’s Nina struggling with alcoholism after the death of her husband, teenagers Tyler (Connor Jessup) and Kinsey (Emilia Jones) trying to fit in at a new high school, and Bode being a small, curious kid surrounded by problems way beyond his age. Throw in the keys, and the result is dark, messy, and intricate.,While all of these elements are prominent, the show has a particularly tight focus on Tyler and Kinsey and the ensuing high school drama that entails. There are subplots about dating and dances, but they don’t feel forced or out of place. Instead, the writing does a great job of connecting everything, whether it’s a new key with horrifying potential or Kinsey figuring out who she wants to go out with. (At one point, she finally starts dating after using the Head Key to remove her fear, so she’s no longer scared to make a move.) The drawback of this focus is that the show doesn’t fully explore the intriguing, deep mythology that’s in the comics. Essentially, the show expands the focus on characters and the expense of lore. For the most part, the trade-off works. It also provides more fruitful ground for future seasons, which will likely depart even further from the source material.,On the surface, , looks like plenty of shows that are already out there. It’s dark and moody, mixing teen angst with lots of magic. But within that familiar framework, it does just enough to stand out. The inventive premise creates the kind of mystery that makes you hit “next episode,” while each new key reveal further expands the magical possibilities. For a show that can feel so familiar, it does a remarkable job of keeping you guessing. The fact that it’s a largely faithful adaptation of an iconic comic series is just a bonus."
BoJack Horseman was a powerful show about addiction and a messy one about celebrity,"
          Feb  5, 2020, 11:50am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"As, progressed through its six seasons, the show’s most obvious punchline didn’t get funnier; it got scarier.,Yes, the cartoon horse was depressed. And an alcoholic. And he hurt the man with cancer. And gave the teens booze. And nearly slept with one. And tanked careers in order to save his own. And left someone to die. But when ,concluded with its final eight episodes, it wasn’t interested in a laugh so much as a reckoning.,BoJack Horseman,Everything finally catches up to BoJack, in a way. A Netflix original about a former sitcom star attempting a comeback while also dealing with addiction and depression, , followed an anthropomorphic horse who continually tried to dull the pain of his previous bad behavior with something worse. As the show grew in scope and fleshed out a large cast of characters, it explored all kinds of ideas and stories, but the two most persistent ones were directly tied to its main character: addiction and the way celebrity fosters and protects toxicity. With its finale, the show finally locks BoJack up (for breaking and entering after a near-fatal bender), following him on a break from his 14-month sentence, which was granted so he can attend his friend and former agent Princess Carolyn’s wedding.,Maybe it seems disingenuous to suggest a show that put its main character in prison for bad behavior is somehow letting him off the hook, but ,’s bittersweet farewell to its protagonist is a goodbye that chooses the parts of the show about addiction and recovery at the expense of those about abuse and power. It’s a decision that comes across as odd when the entire final season was built around taking stock of BoJack’s awful actions throughout the whole series and bringing them to light in a way that mirrors the way real-world bad men have been exposed in recent years.,When reporters piece together BoJack’s complicity in the death of his former child co-star Sarah-Lynn, along with many of his other misdeeds, the quieter life he’s come to find and love — sober, teaching college theater — comes crashing down. He gives a nationally televised interview that initially goes well for him, given our culture’s tendency to favor repentant men over their victims. Goaded by this success, BoJack does a follow-up interview, and this one reveals his pattern of abusive and predatory behavior for all the world to see. , is often overwhelmingly focused on its characters’ interiority — to the point that it had to remind the audience in stark, horrific terms that its protagonist’s selfish actions had real and devastating effects on the people around him. (One of the main ideas behind , was a cautionary tale about identifying with characters like BoJack too much.) In reminding viewers of its very large cast of characters and the ways almost all of them have been hurt or used up by BoJack,— a few to their last breath — season 6 of the show is about as damning as you can get.,Yet, Princess Carolyn’s wedding is a bittersweet finale that reads as strangely fond of BoJack. , isn’t unsympathetic to his victims. By the time the series ends, his former friends have drawn new boundaries around their lives, and it’s not particularly clear if there will be room for BoJack in them when he gets his freedom back. They all are friendly with him, sure, but he’s also presumably haunted by the ghosts of the people who won’t even see him or can’t. ,That guilt is only alluded to in the finale proper, but it’s explicitly given its due in the penultimate episode, “The View From Halfway Down,” a near-death vision of hell or purgatory that traps BoJack in a dinner party with everyone he’s ever hurt. ,’s finale, “Nice While It Lasted,” is mostly preoccupied with how a man who’s made all of these mistakes might go on with his life. ,In the end, it was always a messy idea to marry a story about mental health and addiction to a story about a powerful, abusive celebrity. Power muddies the waters, demanding a specific response when , ultimately wants to contemplate more universal ones. What do you do when you let your demons get the best of you, when you’ve done things that are unforgivable? Can you find redemption? What do you do when you’ve done awful things, and the only answer you know for sure is that life’s a bitch, and you keep living? ,A television show doesn’t owe anyone a moral roadmap for living our lives, or even a particularly moral fictional universe. BoJack can keep getting away with things, and , could probably make compelling TV out of it. (Showrunner Raphael Bob-Waksberg had , on having at least one more season.) The trouble is when , collapses two of its running themes — one of mental health and addiction and the other of power and abuse — into a single conclusion, suggesting that they complement each other when they do not. In the end, , loved BoJack Horseman too much. ,This result — a finale that asks “How does BoJack go on with his life now?”,without really giving a solid answer — is a fitting one for a show that wanted to explore the life of an awful person with unexamined mental health issues and addiction. But for the other ,, the show about a powerful celebrity who was once washed up and finds his way to relevance again through the discarded lives of the people around him, that ambiguity feels too kind. It’s dishonest about the nature of power, which lets people behave with impunity because the rules are different for them. This does not mean redemption and rehabilitation are impossible, but the rules for them, by necessity, are different, too. , never really makes that distinction, and it’s arguably poorer for it.,In this way, , recalls the finale of ,, another show that went long and hard in its final episodes to damn its protagonist, only to bid farewell wistfully as the music played and its hero, while superficially punished, enjoyed one last moment with the life they stole. Perhaps there is honesty in this — life isn’t so neat, and attempts at being good don’t always work out — but I could find a way to wish BoJack, the horse-man all-time screw-up, all the best in his life, even if I didn’t want him in mine any longer. BoJack the TV and movie star? He can rot. "

Kevin Hart withdrew after , on his personal Twitter account and related anti-gay stand-up material resurfaced. This year’s Oscars continues its host-less streak in 2020, and the Academy is attempting to once again fill the gaps with presenters who are decidedly less controversial.

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes," wrapped up last week — I won’t get into much detail here (I feel like a ton of people are waiting to watch it when the whole season’s available on Netflix) — but I did want to write briefly about just what a great series it’s been.,One of the things that made ,so great was just how much of a plot it infused into the traditional sitcom formula. Yes, a typical episode involved a core cast of characters dealing with a somewhat predictable set of hijinks, but there was almost always constant forward movement. That pressure made every episode feel fresh and important, and the added tension made the comedy play that much stronger.,One thing I found fascinating about the final episode (again, no spoilers) was how the show almost stepped outside of that structure. It felt more like a coda than a true conclusion (which, arguably, came earlier). That made for a lovely, if also surprisingly relaxed, sendoff and some really sweet moments with its core cast. More than anything else, I really appreciated the show’s dedication to giving Ted Danson truly perfect human lines right until the end.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Disney put out a final trailer for , this week, showing off more of its colorful, cleanly shot, and epic battle sequences. I haven’t come away with a particularly strong understanding of what the movie will be like from all these trailers — in fairness, most people probably have a good understanding of the story already. Mostly, it seems like Disney,just wants to get across how beautiful and inspiring it’s intended to be. The film comes out March 27th.,The new Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson movie is, somehow, a , spinoff and, somehow, also more of an action movie than a horror movie. At the same time, this will probably be one of the best , movies.

Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet is a comedy surprise you can’t miss ,"
          Feb  7, 2020,  4:04pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Video games are a hard thing to love. The medium rarely translates well outside of its own little island — think of all the bad video game adaptations we’ve seen, or how “video game” is usually used as a shorthand for “shallow” when used to describe stories in other media. Games culture does not advocate for itself terribly well. So it’s natural, then, to cringe when you hear of a show like ,, an Apple TV comedy about a fictional video game studio that produces a ,-esque online game. Will it work out? Will people who know about games like it? Will people who don’t? Is it even funny? You get jaded. But instead of another painful serving of,-style nonsense, , is legitimately good on its own merits, and one of the first big TV surprises of the year.,The nine-episode first season, now streaming on Apple TV Plus, follows Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney), creative director of the wildly popular online role-playing game ,, and his fellow developers as they prepare to release their first big expansion, , There’s Poppi (Charlotte Nicdao), the lead developer; Brad (Danny Pudi), the sociopathic money guy; C.W. Longbottom (F. Murray Abraham), the washed-up fantasy writer; and David (David Hornsby), the co-founder who tries to corral them all — which can be difficult because they all hate each other.,This is why , works, even if you don’t know the first thing about video games. It’s about a bunch of misanthropes working together, with comedy derived from the dark ways their toxic relationships push and pull each other around. You don’t need to know how a studio works to recognize an office hierarchy when you see one, or an egomaniac boss, or a shitty coworker that skates on your hard work. ,But it’s also very interested in video games, and it’s not overly concerned with making them look good or demanding anyone take them seriously. In fact, the show is pretty unsparing. The game studio is beholden to the opinions of a dirtbag teen streamer who rates video games on a five-butthole scale, labor is casually exploited, players are gleefully taken advantage of, and in one of the best episodes, it turns out Nazis really love the game they make. ,What makes , so satisfying is how all of its comedy is steeped in character, not in how video games are inherently goofy or ridiculous (though they often are). Watching it, you can trace lines to the sort of comedies from which it’s descended. , is the easiest connection, as co-creators Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Megan Ganz all come from that show. But there’s also a little bit of , in how the small decisions characters make — adding a shovel to their game, opening up an in-game casino, introducing a big mystery to fans without having any idea what the answer is — spiral out into small hurricanes that can result in a farce on corporate sensitivity panels or the formation of a labor union. ,A video game studio makes for a good workplace comedy in 2020, and not because of the widespread industry sentiment about how it deserves its cultural due after years of economic dominance (Don Draper ,). Instead, it’s the perfect place to get a clear look at what work is increasingly starting to look like now that the robber barons of tech have built their empires: largely behind screens, mostly for the filthy rich, all feeding a digital beast that only exists to further its own existence. ,Video game employees are the lucky ones. They get to be exploited while contributing to something they ostensibly like. Everyone else gets all the dysfunction and none of the snacks. "

"In season 3, Stranger Things’ celebration of ’80s pop culture becomes a political ideology ","
          Jul  8, 2019,  3:23pm EDT
        ",Noah Berlatsky,"The third season of ,, like the first two seasons, revels in the fun, funny, nostalgic detritus of 1980s pop culture. Much of the series’s action is set in a mall, the center of teen life before the advent of iPhones and Amazon. In the shopping emporium, the kids buy colorful ‘80s clothes and watch movies like ,and George Romero’s ,. Glimpses of classic ,manuals and period issues of ,are scattered around the screen. Running jokes include references to ‘80s teen sex symbol Phoebe Cates and the bombastically maudlin theme song for ,. Most horror stories surprise the audience with terrifying monsters that leap from the shadows. ,is more invested in surprising viewers with a wave of nostalgic touchstones. ,Season 3 is different from its predecessors, though, in that its retro impulses extend not just to pop culture, but to geopolitics. The season’s plot is steeped in Cold War paranoia. The nostalgia for a threatened Russian invasion is as comforting and cutesy in its own way as references to New Coke or the X-Men. But it’s also an indication that the obsession with the past can indicate not just ongoing affection, but ongoing anxiety. Sometimes, art looks back to the ‘80s because people love the ‘80s. And sometimes it looks back there because the ‘80s, like ,’ Mind Flayer, has its tendrils in the brain of American culture and won’t let go.,The Cold War casts its chilly shadow over season 3 in a couple of ways. The most obvious is via the presence of the Russian army. The USSR wants to use the alternate dimension known as the Upside Down for its own nefarious Cold War purposes, and it has discovered (perhaps by watching previous episodes) that the space between worlds is weakest in Hawkins, Indiana. Soviet spies build a giant scientific facility beneath the Hawkins mall and are buying up land throughout the town with the semi-unwitting help of Hawkins’ corrupt mayor.,The second somewhat more subtle evocation of the Cold War is via horror tropes. The evil Mind Flayer from the Upside Down uses its powers to take over the wills and bodies of various people in Hawkins. It infects them like a virus and turns them into bloody gelatinous blob-things that form part of a single giant monster intelligence.,The plot references ,and (more explicitly) John Carpenter’s ,,,both of which were paranoid Cold War metaphors for communist infiltration and corruption. These were stories in which good Americans lost their individuality and freedom and became incorporated into an evangelical hive mind, reflecting anti-communist fears of Soviet imperialism and collectivism. , ,and ,both had downbeat endings. At that time, it was at least imaginable that the Soviet Union might win, and America would be swallowed by “the ant heap of totalitarianism,” as President Ronald Reagan memorably put it. ,From our own vantage in 2019, though, we know that the US won the Cold War. In that context, revisiting old fears is also a way to revisit old triumphs. In season 3, a Soviet scientist is seduced to the side of good, righteous Americanism by the quintessential capitalist display of a tacky Fourth of July carnival, complete with stuffed animal prizes. The Mind Flayer is defeated on the 4th in that monument to capitalism, the mall, by a bunch of kids shooting it with fireworks stored in a shopping basket. The US military (portrayed as the enemy in earlier seasons), rushes in as the cavalry to clean up at the end.,’ celebration of ‘80s pop culture is more than a goof. In season 3, it becomes an ideology. All of these capitalist touchstones are a reminder that the nation that is free to buy stuff defeated the creeping socialist horde. Under interrogation by the Russian military, Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) repeats over and over that he works for the ice cream chain Scoops Ahoy. He’s telling the truth, and by doing so, he’s telling those looming officers that the real enemy of the USSR is the triumphant employees of capitalism — the kids in tacky sailor suits who will out-consume the dripping, toothy maw of the communist assimilator.,, then, is a patriotic victory lap, as you might expect of a series released on Independence Day. But when American pop culture is still taking that lap some 30 years later, it starts to raise some questions. Why do we need to reassert our Cold War triumph right now? And why, if we won, does that Mind Flayer keep coming back, season after season? Shouldn’t the dead stay dead at some point, rather than rising from their graves, begging to be killed again?,Victory in the Cold War was supposed to mean an ,. The good guys kicked ass, and we were promised we’d get to ride off into the sunset. But instead, communist defeat turned out to mean , at home and a ramping up of multiple wars abroad, not peace and prosperity. Our present is the Upside Down, a topsy-turvy world in which triumph is indistinguishable from defeat.  ,keeps going back to the ‘80s to escape an unpleasant present, but it also keeps going back to the ‘80s to try to somehow get to the better future we were promised. The series is caught in a kind of ,time-loop. It defeats the monsters and creates a better future. Then it looks around, sees Donald Trump’s shadow, and has to wearily jump to the past to try to get back to a better future all over again. ,That idyllic present is out of reach, in part, season 3 suggests, because the enemy in the ‘80s was never really the communists. The Russians in Hawkins are, after all, set up beneath the mall; they’ve become America. The Mind Flayer is built of good, normal, melted-down US citizens, including the sexist assholes who run the local newspaper. ,and the Romero zombie movies could be read as anxious warnings about the communist takeover, but they were also parables about American conformity: the dead groupthink of consumerism and Red Scare anti-communism. The fear that the Soviets will assimilate us is also a fear that our nightmare vision of Soviet deindividuation is, in fact, simply a reflection of our own culture. When we chase that Russian spy through the hall of mirrors with the intrepid Sheriff Hopper, we’re really shooting at ourselves. Who tortures dissenters now or launches wars or corrodes democracy? It’s not the USSR.,, season after season, returns to a fun 1980s small-town rural heartland that is filled with good, friendly pop culture references. And season after season, that sunny nostalgic vision of America’s greatness splits open, and something darker crawls out. Hawkins can’t defeat the monster once and for all because, here in the present, where Hawkins is filled with Trump voters, we know the monster wasn’t defeated. It just grew. America still ,, and repetitive reenactments of past victories aren’t going to change that. ,creators Matt and Ross Duffer love the ‘80s, but they also realize that something in that idyllic past went horribly wrong and needs to be fixed. Alas, time travel doesn’t exist. If you want to kill the Mind Flayer, you need to kill it now."

There’s much more to Stranger Things’ Starcourt Mall than meets the eye,"

        ",Jon Porter,"There’s a reason why the Starcourt Mall, the principal location for the third season of , looks so real: it’s built inside of a real shopping mall. Specifically, it was built inside of Georgia’s Gwinnett Place Mall, which was built just a year before the latest season of Netflix’s show is set. ,Although the set is closed to the public and is currently in the process of being dismantled, eager fans have managed to sneak in to take photos and video of the interior, and the attention to detail is stunning.,Netflix constructed around 40 stores in the mall for the show, which included period-appropriate versions of existing stores like Burger King and Hot Dog on a Stick (complete with their genuine ‘80s uniforms), as well as original creations like Scoops Ahoy, which apparently featured a boat-shaped restaurant booth that you can only partially see in the show.,Along with other historically believable shops that the show’s characters visit throughout the course of the show, there are almost a half-dozen extra stores that were built and filled with period-appropriate signage and products, but they never appeared on camera. Typically, film sets aren’t a full structure or room; it’s cheaper to build the bare minimum needed for a shot. That Netflix opted to build out entire stores suggests that the filmmakers wanted a bit of flexibility with how they shot the show, allowing them to shoot from any angle without worrying about an unfinished background. ,One such unused store is a WixandStix. In the ,, set decorator Jess Royal details the amazing lengths she went to in order to build a set that didn’t make the cut. In fact, the candle shop came out looking so period-appropriate that there was apparently even talk of writing it into the show, although these plans never materialized. Apparently, transforming the mall itself was helped by a scrapbook the production team found while scouting the location, which contained images of what the mall looked like in the ‘80s.,Local Atlanta newspaper , that the set is currently in the process of being dismantled after Netflix reportedly decided against leaving it in place as a permanent tourist attraction. Unfortunately, it sounds like the mall could really use the customization. Most of the mall’s units are apparently now empty, with only a handful of shops remaining.,With the retro mall now probably disappearing forever, we can at least take a video tour that one fan was able to film and posted to YouTube last year, complete with period storefronts and products in the windows.

Meanwhile, her husband (played by Justin Chatwin) is tasked with figuring out where the artifact came from, and it looks as though there are bigger ramifications for the fate of humanity thrown in for good measure. Along the way, alien monsters, crew members apparently developing strange powers, and parties on the flight deck also factor into the story. ,The series seems to have the feel of some of the big, goofy science fiction shows of the early 2000s, like ,,,, ,, as well as shows like ,, ,, ,, and Netflix’s ,.

It was a great season — the show did an admirable job balancing three-ish separate but related plot lines, and I loved how much wackiness it was able to bring to the series while still being able to slip into much more serious modes when it needed to. Seriously, we need the Steve and Robin spinoff ASAP.,But ,is also one of those shows that makes me question whether Netflix’s “release everything at once” strategy is really the best way to go. We could still be talking about episode 1 right now, analyzing where the series is going and what it’s exploring while our attachments to the characters grow. This is a big part of fandom and criticism in 2019, and Netflix shows... kind of just blip in and out instead of fostering conversation.,It’s too bad. It means we all have to rush through a show and that most of us think about ,for all of a week each year, despite just how good it is. Now that Netflix is so well established (same with ,), I don’t know that it needs to use the all-at-once gimmick for everything to get people’s attention.

The numbers predictably drop off a bit as the series goes on, with an average of 8.86 million viewers per episode. And the episode-to-episode ratings show that nearly 1.35 million viewers skipped episode 7 in favor of jumping right to the season finale. The company also says 824,000 people watched the entire series on July 4th.

Netflix removes 13 Reasons Why’s controversial suicide scene,"
          Jul 16, 2019, 12:08pm EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"Netflix has removed a controversial, explicit scene depicting a character’s suicide in its original series ,, two years after the show’s original debut. ,The company cited advice from medical experts and the upcoming launch of the show’s third season as the main reason, according to a statement ,. As more viewers come to Netflix to watch the show, the company said it wants to ensure proper actions are taken to protect fans.,The scene in question was about three minutes in length and originally played halfway through the show’s season one finale. It explicitly depicted the main character, Hannah, cutting her wrists open and bleeding to death. The new version now jumps from Hannah staring at herself in the mirror to her parents dealing with the aftershock of what happened. ,“No one scene is more important than the life of the show, and its message that we must take better care of each other,” showrunner Brian Yorkey said in a statement to ,. “We believe this edit will help the show do the most good for the most people while mitigating any risk for especially vulnerable young viewers.”,This isn’t the first time medical professionals, parents’ groups, and suicide-prevention experts have criticized Netflix and Yorkey for including the scene. Netflix executives were warned by professionals that ,’s,graphic portrayal of suicide went against every guideline on how to handle the delicate subject matter. Still, Netflix and Yorkey left the scene in. Scientists, however, , in teen deaths from suicide following the show’s release.,Authors behind the study , in May acknowledged that because there isn’t conclusive evidence that people who died from suicide during the study period watched ,, it “does not provide definitive proof” that ,is associated with harmful outcomes.” They did note they found the increase in death overall “concerning.” Results from two recent studies have led scientists and healthcare professionals to voice concerns about the show producing a , effect. Researchers have observed that being exposed to suicide or suicidal behaviors either in a person’s personal life, , can cause an increase in suicidal behavior — ,s. ,The American Association of Suicidology, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American School Counselor Association, Dr. Helen Hsu from Stanford, advocacy group Mental Health America, the Trevor Project, and Dr. Rebecca Hedrick from Cedars-Sinai issued a joint statement to ,condoning Netflix’s decision to remove the scene. ,“This positive change will ensure that , continues to encourage open conversation about mental health and suicide prevention — while also mitigating the risk for the most vulnerable teenage viewers,” the statement reads. ,Other parties have questioned Netflix’s decision to remove the scene. While some groups advocated against the scene, others have questioned whether excising it is beneficial. Some argue that losing the scene could actually do more harm. ,“The argument ,glorifies suicide is actually made infinitely stronger by removing the suicide itself,” , Myles McNutt, associate professor of media studies at the University of Wisconsin. “Without showing Hannah’s shock and pain, the ‘suicide as revenge’ plan goes too smoothly. I understand the potential harm of ‘how to’ in showing the suicide, but the way it’s depicted is horrifying, and the story is built in a way that you need that horror.” ,This isn’t the first time Netflix has agreed to alter a scene or change the direction of a series because of public feedback. In March, the company also re-edited its original movie ,, which originally used stock footage of a real-life fatal train derailment to depict a fictional disaster. The company resisted the cut through three months of controversy and criticism, but ,. More recently, the company promised to cut down on scenes that , in light of controversy over the most ,. Netflix routinely has one of the highest percentages of people smoking onscreen, ,, a nonprofit public health organization, and criticism has stirred change within Netflix.,“Netflix strongly supports artistic expression,” the company ,in a statement about the new anti-smoking initiative. “We also recognize that smoking is harmful, and when portrayed positively on screen can adversely influence young people. Going forward, all new projects that we commission with ratings of TV-14 or below for series or PG-13 or below for films, will be smoking and e-cigarette free.” ,But there’s a difference between eliminating smoking on-screen and altering a show’s central drama. In this case, the overwhelming opinion is that Netflix is doing the right thing, especially considering its younger viewers. Even if it took two years to happen."
Hulu’s Handmaid’s Tale is a model of longform worldbuilding,"
          Jul 15, 2019, 12:51pm EDT
        ",Liz Shannon Miller,"Sometimes, discovering a new fictional world is like forming a crush on a relative stranger. It’s easy to get swept up in the excitement for something fresh and unique. In fiction, that can mean discovering a new universe that feels revelatory. But often, the more you learn about that world, the less it holds up, and the less time you want to spend with it. Reading the next book in the series, or watching another episode, you become disappointed, because this shiny new world doesn’t make nearly as much sense once the details are filled in.,The secret comes down to ensuring that each new detail introduced, each new development, not only makes coherent sense within the narrative’s established framework, but actually enhances the audience’s understanding. And most franchises don’t hit that bar. The Wachowskis’ original 1999 film , is a good example. It’s a near-perfect science fiction movie on its own, set in a future where machines have turned the human race into batteries kept complacent by a virtual reality. But the ancillary material (including comics, animated shorts, and video games) tried to build a simple story into an epic story-verse, and the sequels , and , added in some convoluted notions without enhancing the original story. For all the time the story spends in the human city of Zion, the dance-orgy and character-drama segments don’t say much about how this future functions, or add dimension to the man vs. machine conflict. The new details complicate the franchise without helping hold it together, or providing meaningful story hooks for the main characters.,The , universe — both in print novels and in the films — has also been subjected to heavy analysis (both , and ,) from fans who don’t feel the details add up. All those nitpicks, though, are really rooted in discovering the flaws of J.K. Rowling’s worldbuilding. For instance, she takes the time to establish a fantasy financial system, complete with its own coinage: galleons, sickles, and knuts. But a Reddit user who did the math on how much those were worth , — like how Harry had to spend more money for textbooks than his own wand, and the vast price discrepancies for various types of candy. And Rowling’s expansion of the “Potterverse,” through official Hogwarts “textbooks” like ,, or the , films she’s scripted, have either , or just made it busier and more frantic. The more she adds to the Wizarding World outside of her books, the less sense it makes — and the more fans have rebelled against her casual additions to the story.,But sometimes, the more opportunity a creator gets to build out a world, the richer it becomes. In adapting ,, , , that the show could have easily been a one-season miniseries, especially given that season 1 completed its adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s classic novel. But in season 3, showrunner Bruce Miller has justified the ongoing continuation of Hulu’s dystopian drama by avoiding the expansion trap many other franchises face. In terms of worldbuilding, Atwood gave Miller a road map that could theoretically stretch centuries into the future. And Miller and his creative team have been skilled at inventing new ways to illustrate how the country of Gilead — a separatist state in a splintered America — operates politically and personally.,With each subsequent episode of ,, the world of the show continues to evolve. As handmaid June (Elisabeth Moss) fights within the system to try to bring it down, the world’s political climate is progressively getting more definition. The expansion of character backstories and flashbacks speaks to the changes which led to the rise of Gilead. The Commanders still wear suits, their wives still wear teal uniforms, but this season, we’re seeing the regional differences between the fashions in what was once Boston and what was once Washington, DC.,And the show’s increasing scope and ambition are giving viewers a wider perspective than just what’s happening in Gilead. In Canada, June’s husband Luke (O.T. Fagbenle), best friend Moira (Samira Wiley), and former handmaid Emily (Alexis Bledel) struggle with expatriate life, and with the knowledge of who and what they’ve left behind. Baby Nichole, who Emily brought to Canada, has become a political football, as Commander Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) demands the return of the “kidnapped” child. When he takes his case to the media, it becomes an international issue. ,More and more, the show features the Commanders meeting to discuss the ongoing battles to maintain control of their territory — not just because of the ongoing war against what’s left of the United States, but because of the international political battles Gilead faces as it tries to assert itself as an officially recognized regime. Meanwhile, the Aunts contemplate how to maintain control over the increasingly rebellious handmaids and other women who may not be fully loyal to the cause. This season, their methods are becoming more brutal, from public hangings to even more horrific mutilations than usual — except that the show is also careful to make it clear that the public face of Gilead is concerned with keeping these punishments under wraps. June is sometimes able to flaunt this fact to Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd), since Waterford includes her in his televised pleas for the return of Nichole, and it would look bad for her to appear abused on camera., is at its best when the warping effects of this world’s crumbling birth rate is at the center of the narrative, as it taps into the sort of primal terror about the end of mankind that could potentially motivate a society to such acts of cruelty, in the name of “the greater good.” But the greater good is often even greater for the rich and powerful. One of the most striking aspects of season 3’s sixth episode, “Household,” is meeting the Waterfords’ host in the rebranded capital of Gilead — not just Commander Winslow (Christopher Meloni) and his wife Mrs. Winslow (Elizabeth Reaser), but their five children, adopted and otherwise. “The privileges of rank,” snarky servant Rita remarks. But the way one of Gilead’s most powerful leaders has used his privilege to grant himself a house full of young laughter — the most children seen together on-screen in the entire history of the show, apart from in flashbacks — speaks to the ways this society still has its complicated politics and underlying secrets.,And judged on the basis of architectural plausibility, Gilead’s choice to transform the Washington Monument into a gigantic cross might seem absurd. But as a potent symbol of what has happened to America, it’s a brutal yet effective visual choice. More importantly, it’s consistent with what viewers already know about the Gilead leadership, a group of men who used fundamentalist panic over declining birth rates to tear down their country and invent a new and terrible realm.,The human cost of their actions, meanwhile, is never forgotten. One of the most haunting sequences of “Under His Eye,” season 3’s seventh episode, comes when Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) and Mrs. Winslow tour an unrestored DC residence that the Waterfords might move into. “Unrestored” in this instance means that the house is a wreck. Broken glass and abandoned belongings tell the story of the previous residents’ violent exit. There are no bodies, but the moldy wine glass, dusty video game controller, and once-cheery nursery say plenty about the house’s past — and Serena and Mrs. Winslow’s nonchalant acceptance of the scene reveals that in Gilead, this is normal and expected.,The future of , as a story universe will experience a fascinating complication this fall, with the publication of ,, Atwood’s official sequel to her original novel. The book takes place 15 years after the end of ,, and in ,, Atwood promised, “everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”,Whether , will align with the TV show’s universe remains to be seen. While Atwood is a producer on the series, and Miller has frequently referred to consulting with her while developing the show over the years, the book seems poised to stand alone. If they’ve coordinated their stories, it may enhance the TV version of Gilead, rather than contradicting it. In the meantime, the third season of , continues to take care in making every horrific detail feel real to the audience. It’s real enough for the show’s most terrifying trait to come into focus: the idea that what it depicts isn’t too far off from what could happen today."

"Netflix suffers first major loss of US subscribers, blames price hikes","

        ",Julia Alexander,"Netflix didn’t add nearly as many subscribers as the company projected it would in the second quarter of 2019, and saw a loss in US subscribers ,, when the company separated its DVD mail-order system and streaming platform.,The company lost approximately 130,000 subscribers in the United States in Q2, and only gained 2.7 million global subscribers, after projecting it would add 5 million. CEO Reed Hastings blamed the stagnancy on the company’s price hikes, and a lack of original content to bring in new subscribers. The company ,, one of its biggest increases to date. Plan changes went into effect for both new and returning subscribers. As such, paid memberships in the United States were “essentially flat.”,“Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases,” Hastings ,. “We don’t believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape during Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions.”,The news has led to an immediate stock drop for the company. Hastings’ letter to investors argues that the company’s next two quarters will see growth because of new seasons of Netflix successes like ,, ,, and ,, which is getting a final season. Still, the stock drop and Disney, WarnerMedia, Apple, and NBC Universal’s race to create the first “Netflix killer” may be a sign that confidence in Netflix is waning. ,Now Hastings, who once famously declared that ,, is trying to gain that confidence back. The CEO addressed the ,, two of its most watched shows, in his letter.,“Much of our domestic, and eventually global, Disney catalog, as well as ,, and some other licensed content will wind down over the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content,” Hastings wrote. “From what we’ve seen in the past when we drop strong catalog content (Starz and Epix with Sony, Disney, and Paramount films, or second run series from Fox, for example) our members shift over to enjoying our other great content.”,Netflix is still the leader in the streaming industry, but Hastings and other executives know competition is looming. Disney and Apple are gearing up to launch their , , this year, ushering in a wave of new tentpole series. Disney, which will charge $6.99 a month, also has a large catalog of fan and family favorites, and it’s bringing some of its most popular characters from Marvel and , movies to new TV shows for its service. Apple is reportedly spending , on its series See, starring Jason Momoa,more than HBO spent on episodes of ,. ,Executives at Netflix know they have to invest in new series that can take the place of ,and ,, but the company is already projected to ,.,“Library content won’t kill the Netflix US subscriber story, however, it will force them to continually spend on riskier, high-profile concepts, market their shows more aggressively, and allow competitors to copy Netflix’s initial approach in building out their own services,” analyst Michael Nathanson , ahead of Netflix’s earnings call.,While Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, Amazon, and NBC Universal continue to flash their upcoming projects as a way to attract some of Netflix’s subscribers, Netflix is trying to show its strength. The company released some new viewership numbers in its earning report, adding to recently reported statistics for series like ,third season, which saw more than 40.7 million household accounts watching some part of season during its first four days of release, ,, Ava DuVernay’s critically acclaimed documentary series, was watched by 25 million households in its first four weeks, according to the letter. Netflix counts a view as one account watching at least 70 percent of a title. The nature documentary ,was watched by 33 million households in its first four weeks. Adam Sandler’s ,is also one of Netflix’s most-watched original movies, with more than 73 million households watching the movie in its first month. ,A big part of Netflix’s overall strategy to remain on top of the streaming food chain is continuing to excel in territories the competition isn’t targeting. The majority of Netflix’s growth over the last few quarters has come from international markets — an area Hastings has talked about expanding into for close to five years. ,Netflix already has a major presence in these spaces, and it’s investing heavily in localized content for specific regions. Other companies haven’t spoken about similar investment strategies in the lead-ups to their launches. Netflix executives are planning to pump even more resources into international content development as an effort to stay ahead of the competition.,“We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7 million,” Hastings wrote, with 6.2 million of those accounts coming from international markets. “Our internal forecast still currently calls for annual global paid net adds to be up year over year.”"

The trailer for Steven Universe: The Movie introduces a new villain and a new look,"

        ",Tasha Robinson,"As of the end of the last season of Cartoon Network’s beloved science-fiction-and-feelings animated series ,, things seemed pretty ideal for the heroes. The series’ biggest villains broke down and talked about their emotions, and came at least provisionally to terms with their past mistakes. It looked like Steven might finally be able to return to Earth and live as normal a life as a half-human, half-alien kid who’s constantly in the middle of cosmic wars can live.,So of course the upcoming animated film introduces a whole new villain.,The trailer, which debuted at San Diego Comic-Con, gives Steven a slightly new look — he’s a little older, a little taller, a little thinner, and overall less of a tiny wee donut of a boy — but it otherwise looks familiar, as Steven and his friends Connie, Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl return to Earth, celebrate their victory, and hope for a little peace. Instead, a giggling pink figure shows up to destroy the planet.,Earth has been threatened repeatedly in ,, but it’s usually been more of a passive, existential threat, with the understanding that aliens who live on a much longer timeline were eventually going to get around to finishing the destructive planet-mining they began aeons ago. This trailer suggests a much more immediate destructive threat, from an antagonist with weird new stretchy powers and unclear motives. Is it possible Steven’s run up against someone he can’t hug, cry, or talk into cooperating with him? Probably not, but we’ll find out when the movie airs on September 2nd."

A war is brewing in the new trailer for HBO’s fantasy series His Dark Materials ,"

        ",Andrew Liptak,"The BBC and HBO unveiled a new trailer for their upcoming TV series, ,, showing off a fantastical world where a war is brewing between an authoritarian Church and those who resist it. ,Based off the book series by Philip Pullman, the series is set in an alternate world where every person has their own shapeshifting, animal-shaped companion, a manifestation of their soul. These companions are called Daemons. The story follows a young girl named Lyra Belacqua (played by ,’s Dafne Keen) who grows up as an orphan in Oxford. When children begin vanishing, including her best friend Roger, she sets off into the Arctic to find him, and discovers a conspiracy involving her world’s domineering Church. ,This latest trailer shows off the stakes of the war that’s brewing between the Church and its opponents. Lyra is caught in the middle: her uncle, Lord Asriel (played by James McAvoy), is one of those who resist the Church. Church agent Mrs. Coulter (played by Ruth Wilson) takes Lyra under her wing for nefarious purposes, and it soon becomes clear that she’s up to some fairly twisted experiments involving children. Along the way, Lyra picks up an  oracular device called an aletheometer, meets aeronaut Lee Scoresby (played by Lin-Manuel Miranda) and armored polar bear Iorek Byrinson, and recruits them to help her free her friends and disrupt the Church’s plans., is a , (plus a recently released prequel, ,) that explores the nature of ethics and consciousness.

In the trailers, we meet Vignette Stonemoss (played by Cara Delvigne) and Rycroft “Philo” Philostrate (played by Orlando Bloom), and learn that the Vignette’s fantastical homeworld was peaceful until humanity arrived and brought war and violence with them.

Corey, , is set several centuries in the future, where humanity has colonized the solar system and broken into three major factions: Earth, Mars, and the Belters, an alliance of settlements in the asteroid belt and outer planets. The bulk of the series follows the crew of a spaceship called the Rocinante as they find themselves in the midst of an interplanetary war, and have to contend with the discovery of an alien substance called the Protomolecule that’s been weaponized by a malevolent Earth corporation, and which went on to create an gate to thousands of worlds beyond our home system. ,This latest season will be based on the fourth installment of the series, ,, in which the crew of the Rocinante are dispatched to a colonial world known as Ilus to settle a dispute between the corporation that claimed the world, and the settlers who touched down on it first. The planet is also home to the remnants of an alien civilization that created the protomolecule.

Up until this point in the series, humanity has been fighting amongst itself, but now, people have access to thousands of new, uninhabited planets to travel to. The Syfy’s tenure on the series ended right at that point, and had the show not continued, it would have been a natural ending point. ,But the book series will last for nine installments, and the penultimate book, ,, hit bookstores earlier this year. , is a good opportunity for Amazon to reboot the show, as it brought in a couple of new major storylines for the series.

"Netflix’s Another Life starts as Arrival, then turns into Star Trek","
          Jul 23, 2019,  1:47pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"Netflix’s science fiction series ,, which premieres on July 25th, opens with a promising premise, but it isn’t a particularly original one: it mashes up plot points from ,and Syfy’s ,, which was canceled after a single season. , opens with an ouroboros-like alien spacecraft cruising above Earth, then crashing into a soybean field and turning into a crystalline communications tower. When terrestrial attempts to analyze it reveal little information beyond that it’s broadcasting information to Pi Canis Majoris, which is 96.5 light-years from Earth, the US sends its most sophisticated spaceship, the Salvare, to make first contact.,Unfortunately, that narrative is largely kicked to the back burner after the show’s first episode in favor of a series of even more derivative ,-style episodic conflicts. Set in the relatively near future where humanity has developed spaceships that can travel faster than light, and technology that puts people in stasis for long journeys, the story of the 10-episode first season (four episodes were provided for previews) largely follows Niko Breckinridge (Katee Sackhoff), a veteran astronaut who was involved in a disastrous mission to Saturn nine years before that left half the crew dead. She’s taking control of the Salvare from her own protégé Ian Yerxa (Tyler Hoechlin of ,and ,), who the US military deems too hot-headed for such a sensitive mission but still leaves on the ship to question all of Niko’s decisions.,There’s something inherently funny about having Sackhoff, who played the notorious maverick Starbuck on ,, serving as the voice of caution and reason on board the Salvare. But the series’s initial conflicts are so absurd that they blunt the impact of her role reversal. In the first episode, fiery communications expect Michelle Vargas (,’s Jessica Camacho) rants about how anyone older than 27 is a coward and expresses admiration for the ,. (Camacho is actually 36.) This leads into a weak explanation of why most of the crewmembers are hot 20-somethings: they’re healthy and capable of making bold decisions. That seems like it would be important for the members of a colony ship, but not necessarily the best crew for what characters are constantly saying is the most important space mission in human history.,Beyond the obvious conflict of leaving Ian on board to ensure the crew has divided loyalties, the Salvare,also inexplicably includes sitting congressman Sasha Harrison (Jake Abel), who has never left Earth or even met his fellow astronauts before they all emerge from stasis in deep space. He spends most of his time trying to convince everyone that he isn’t useless or that old. (He’s one of the youngest members of Congress ever!) One of the tells of his ignorance about space travel is that he questions why no one is in uniform; instead, they’re prancing around dressed like Abercrombie models or just wearing sports bras and booty shorts. Again, there’s no real reason given, though the engineers do occasionally wear uniforms just so they can create sexual tension by stripping them off while working in warm areas of the ship.,When the Salvare’s crew isn’t fighting or flirting with each other, they’re dealing with cliché crises like a deadly space virus or a malfunction that forces them to land on a dangerous, unexplored planet. The Salvare has an entire backup crew in stasis, which it uses in a way reminiscent of ,’s ,. They can be taken out to provide some form of expertise, then die dramatically or replace other minor characters who need to die to prove a given situation is serious.,That dynamic of casual character-swapping largely just emphasizes how hollow most of the show’s characters feel. Sackhoff does her best to deliver emotional performances and bring gravitas to the clunky scripts. She does particularly excellent work in episode 4, “Guilt Trip,” where she’s stuck in a series of nightmares confronting her feelings about the Saturn mission and leaving her eight-year-old daughter to go to space. It’s a knock-off of ,and the seminal ,episode “Tapestry,”,but it’s still effective character-building.,Creator Aaron Martin has borrowed plenty of episode ideas from ,, but his show lacks any driving philosophy. Niko provides an avenue for some relevant conflicts about how women with authority are perceived and the guilt of working mothers. It’s nice to see a future where the fact that the ship’s medic, Zayn Petrossian (JayR Tinaco), is nonbinary isn’t worth commenting on. The sensitive AI William (Samuel Anderson), created like the assistants from , to be a perfect interface for Niko, provides some opportunity for the study of human nature, though very little of that wasn’t done with ,’s Data. ,There’s plenty of talk about how climate change has caused major cities to flood and made clean water expensive, though it’s hard to tell from the scenes on Earth, which are full of beautiful Vancouver landscapes and perfect suburban homes. If this were a weightless, episodic science fiction series, that could be refreshing, but dabbling in heavier issues and eschewing humor or self-awareness means ,can’t fill that niche, either.,While most of the action happens on the Salvare, the show periodically returns to Earth, where Niko’s husband, Erik Wallace (Justin Chatwin), is trying to communicate with the aliens in a manner cribbed straight from ,. He does a fine job of playing a scientist alternating between long periods of failure and momentary triumphant success, but he doesn’t have much to do but deliver technobabble and worry about Niko. His plot also intersects too often with the intolerable Harper Glass (,’s Selma Blair), who reports on the alien artifact to her website’s 250 million followers, making her the world’s most popular journalist.,also lacks much visual identity. It’s relatively light on CGI, with the exception of some blue lightning effects used to demonstrate ship malfunctions, and a grotesque sequence in the virus episode. The,Salvare has a sort of near-future functionality reminiscent of the nicer ships on ,. None of the other visuals of stars and planets really stand out as impressive or novel, adding to the , knock-off vibe.,By the end of the fourth episode of the 10-episode season, the crew of the Salvare,is ready to finally do something that relates to the alien artifact. That could help get ,back on track, but the fact that the writers have wasted so much of their opening act revisiting such familiar science fiction clichés with so little personal flavor or variety makes a strong, startling turnaround feel unlikely. Despite its potential, ,just feels like a generic, humorless space adventure that’s likely to crash and burn long before it unravels its big mysteries."

        ",Shana O'Neil,"When the screen adaptation of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson’s , comic books premieres on Amazon Prime Video on July 26th, fans will likely notice a lot of changes to the story. But creator and showrunner Eric Kripke (,, ,) has crafted an adaptation that honors the comics while also giving new audiences access to a story that comes at viewers hard and fast., is set in an America where superheroes are heavily commodified and merchandised. They’re brand names. They’re not just saving the world; they’re starring in movies, splashed across billboards for theme parks, endorsing everything from shoes to cereal, and marketed within an inch of their lives.,At the center of their world is Vought International, a multibillion-dollar corporation that employs more than 200 superheroes, managing their schedules, lives, and images. Like any business, Vought is looking to make money, and it will protect its investments at any cost. As ,reveals early, there’s certainly a cost because superheroes are dicks.,Spider-Man’s “With great power comes great responsibility” ideology seems to have completely missed ,’ heroes who don’t take much responsibility for the damage they cause. They catch criminals and save people under Vought’s management, but they consider collateral damage — like, say, obliterating a random bystander on the way to stop bank robbers — as just the cost of doing business. Vought has entire PR and clean-up teams to deal with such situations, so all the outside world sees is the good the supers do.,But cover-ups only go so far, and every once in a while, the façade breaks. In the case of ,, the cracks come in the form of two people: mild-mannered tech salesperson Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) and Starlight, aka Annie January (Erin Moriarty), the newest member of Vought’s premiere superhero squad, The Seven. While their lives couldn’t be more different, Hughie and Annie become the epicenter of a superhero shake-up that could bring Vought down.,Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban). Billy Butcher hates Vought. He hates superheroes. He wants the entire superhero business to burn to the ground, and he’s made it his mission to punish heroes who step out of line. He’s crass, he’s sexist, he’s vulgar, he’s violent, and he lies about pretty much everything. He isn’t looking to save the world. His vendetta is personal. But his goal to take down Vought wins Hughie to his side, which quickly pulls Hughie in over his head.,When I , in December 2018, he told me , is a “hard R, it’s a big difference from anything I’ve done before. But anyone who knows me knows that I have a super filthy sense of humor… I’ve never been able to express it to the public… My parents are gonna be horrified.” That’s certainly possible because he really does shoot for the moon in making , transgressive and boundary-pushing. It’s a gory show, with blood and brains and severed arms and brutal fights.,The adaptation cleaves hard from the source material when it comes to graphic adult material like sex, nudity, assault, and torture. No one is spared in the bloodbath. And yet there’s a relatability to the Boys, from Billy Butcher’s need for revenge on the supers over his wife’s death to Hughie’s similar fight for justice after one of the supers kills his girlfriend by running through her. Other members of the group, including Frenchie, Mother’s Milk, and The Female, have their own reasons for wanting to fight the superheroes or take down Vought itself. Their violent missions feel like a righteous cause taken to the extreme, unlike the supers’ casual brutality.,It would have been easy to turn , into a misogynistic splatterfest, but Kripke navigates around that trap while also dropping in a few elements that add equality to the picture. Sure, Billy Butcher calls the Statue of Liberty a “slit” and throws the word “cunt” around like confetti, but multiple men strip down for the show — including Karl Urban and another character who goes full-frontal — while there’s no corresponding female nudity. The contrast is rare enough to feel refreshing, and the nudity in the script isn’t sexualizing the characters. It feels like a polite nod to the female gaze, rather than anything specifically gratuitous.,More significantly, , grapples directly with the #MeToo era in a plot thread where Starlight is sexually assaulted by one of The Seven as part of her “initiation,” but she finds a way not just to fight back, but to claim her own agency among the group. The men also get their illuminating, human moments. Mother’s Milk is out kicking superhero ass, but he’s also maintaining a strong, loving relationship with his wife, whether it’s taking her calls no matter how inopportune the time, or bringing home lobster for dinner. Like Frenchie’s nurturing, philosophical side and Hughie’s vulnerability, these human details make the characters more rounded and the violence seem more personal.,Kripke does seem to delight in just how meteorically out-there he can get with ,. Aside from the general mayhem caused by superhero powers used without restraint, the psychological side of , gets plumbed with reckless abandon. From a super crushing a man’s skull as she orgasms to another super’s paraphilic infantilism fetish, Kripke uses extreme moments to build the story.,It helps that he’s chosen a cast that grounds so much of ,’ wildness in some sort of understandable reality. Elisabeth Shue is a standout as Vought’s senior VP of hero management, Madelyn Stillwell. A genderbend from the comics’ James Stillwell, Madelyn is an enjoyable subversion of Shue’s likability factor in , or , as a younger woman and more recently on ,. Madelyn is beautiful, charming, supportive, and smart. But her job at Vought is all about branding, and she’s aware that image is everything. Underneath her pearlescent smile, she’s a keen hunter who’s willing to do whatever it takes to secure her power at Vought.,Billy Butcher is a right bastard, but Urban balances a maniacal glee with a wounded determination that keeps him human even when he’s planning to blow people up. Urban may be broadly familiar these days as Dr. Leonard McCoy in the , film reboots, but longtime fans know he can just as easily play villains, like Vaako in ,, or disillusioned good guys like John Kennex in ,, and he’s handled more than his fair share of action.,And Jack Quaid (the son of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan) brings an intriguing mix of insecure intelligence, charm, and unexpressed rage to Hughie Campbell. As the entry point for the series, the character being introduced to a new world of violence, Quaid’s Hughie has to be likable while still being a doormat. Simon Pegg is perfect as Hughie’s dad, offering an idea of how Hughie became those things. On the other side of the spectrum, Antony Starr’s Homelander is vibrating with menace and fanatical belief. Other cast members play their roles in big, forceful ways without going too far over-the-top, which is an impressive feat in a show that’s so close to over-the-top most of the time.,Lucky for ,, it’s in the right hands. Kripke and executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have a knack for pushing right up to the line of outrageousness without going over. Kripke has assembled veteran TV directors like Daniel Attias (,), Philip Sgriccia (,), and Stefan Schwartz (,) alongside newer talents like Jennifer Phang (,) to help bring out the glitz and grime of the original , comics. Like ,, , also takes more than its fair share of shots at Christianity and organized religion, especially with the superhero character of Ezekiel. But the story also delves into Starlight’s faith. Christianity is part of her superhero identity and marketing, and she finds strength in it when everything she thought she knew about superheroes comes crashing down.,Filled with blasphemy, guts, sex, and heartfelt emotion, , is going to alienate some viewers. It’s deliberately pushing boundaries. It’s crass, it’s bloody, it’s brutal, and it’s got a raunchy sense of humor. But it’s a hell of a lot of fun. And for viewers who love a little anarchy and bedlam in their superhero drama, it hits all the right notes. "

"Since season 1, Jessica Jones has struggled to mix horror with superheroes","
          Jun 18, 2019,  2:33pm EDT
        ",Noah Berlatsky,"The horror and superhero genres approach the world from opposite directions. Horror is meant to make the audience feel disempowered and terrorized. Superhero stories, by contrast, make viewers feel empowered and triumphant. Both genres often set out to give the audience the same thing — a big, satisfying burst of catharsis — but in different ways, and for different reasons.,But at the same time, the genres draw liberally from each other. To heighten the empowerment sensation, the superhero genre often uses horror elements. In the recent film ,, the hero is menaced by oozing, hulking nightmare monsters, and his victory is sweeter because he’s initially terrified by what he has to overcome. Horror, on the other end, often includes a final victorious, empowering reversal. An aging Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in , survives a seemingly fatal fall and comes back to brutalize the villain, Michael Myers. She might as well be the Punisher, taking a brutal beating and coming back for more. Empowerment and disempowerment in these stories aren’t opposites: they’re complements. The superhero and horror genres fit into each other, creating a single monstrous or heroic amalgam.,Netflix’s ,television series has been particularly fascinated with the line between superheroes and horror. The series’ title character (played by Krysten Ritter) is nominally a superhero. She has super strength and can make super-leaps. But she isn’t ,strong; she can bust locks, not tear apart buildings. It’s difficult for villains to convincingly threaten Superman — that requires heavy special effects intervention, or obvious plot fixes like Kryptonite. But threatening Jessica is easy: she isn’t much harder to damage than a regular person. In the show’s most recent season, she’s wounded and has to have her spleen surgically removed, which has to be a first in a superhero story. Jessica is an empowered person always teetering on the edge of disempowerment.,’ initial season,brilliantly exploited the tension between horror tropes and superhero stories by pitting her against a terrifyingly powerful antagonist. Kilgrave (David Tennant) can control minds — whatever he says, people do. Jessica was under his influence for years, but eventually developed an immunity to his power. But everyone around her is susceptible. Kilgrave can manipulate Jessica’s friends and lovers, her neighbors, the police, even random bystanders in the streets.  ,’ first season is essentially an extended slasher movie. The virtually omnipotent Kilgrave stalks Jessica through 13 episodes, orchestrating elaborate nightmare scenarios and murdering whenever the whim strikes him. Around Jessica, daughters smile while they kill their parents, and boyfriends set themselves on fire. The show is even more viscerally disturbing than most horror films because the sense of disempowerment is so absolute. As in horror films like , ,and ,, that sense of futility is explicitly linked to sexual violence. Kilgrave has raped Jessica before, and the threat that he will do so again hangs over the series. Like an abusive spouse or parent, Kilgrave controls the entire world. There’s no way out.,And that makes Jessica’s triumph all the more satisfying and empowering. Like Ripley in ,, or Laurie in ,, or many other Final Girls before her, Jessica snatches victory from defeat, facing the undefeatable and becoming undefeatable herself. Her final confrontation with Kilgrave is a perfect encapsulation of the empowerment / disempowerment dynamic which links horror and superhero narratives. She seems to be completely defeated, losing her self and soul. The threat of further sexualized violence is obvious. And then she suddenly has the power, and her enemy doesn’t. The series has repeatedly questioned whether it’s all right for heroes to kill villains, but there’s no question that Jessica has to kill Kilgrave. She’s a superhero, but he’s put her in a slasher story.,After ,’ brilliant first season — easily the best single season of any of Netflix’s Marvel shows — showrunner Melissa Rosenberg has struggled with ways of balancing its horror and superhero leanings. The second season used a ,-type story, with Jessica’s mother Alisa (Janet McTeer) gaining super strength much greater than Jessica’s after undergoing medical experiments. Those same experiments leave Alisa unable to control her anger. The story unfolds as a kind of tragic horror melodrama (again, ,-like), with Jessica powerless to prevent her mother from destroying herself and others. ,Season 3 has shifted back toward the slasher storyline of the series’ beginning. The main villain is a Hannibal Lecter-like super-smart serial killer named Salinger (Jeremy Bobb). He doesn’t vastly outmatch Jessica as Kilgrave did, so the horror aspects don’t come through as clearly. Rather than running for her life, Jessica spends most of her time trying to figure out how to get evidence for the police. Justice by the book is sometimes a concern of superhero shows, but it’s not something slashers generally worry about much.,Still, as Samantha Nelson points out in her ,, the genre confusion does raise interesting questions about heroism, and less explicitly, about horror. Salinger constantly sneers at Jessica for “cheating” by getting her superpowers through luck, rather than earning them. But Salinger didn’t work for his brains either. Empowerment isn’t really about fairness in superhero or horror narratives. It’s a rush, not a deserved achievement.,And to heighten that rush, to bring home the sense of power, someone else needs to be disempowered. Both horror and superhero stories require unfairness and imbalance. In superhero stories and horror stories alike, there are strong people and weak people. The main difference between the genres is which group viewers are supposed to identify with. Salinger’s resentment of Jessica in season 3 echoes the reactionary bitterness of white male entitlement: he’s angry because he’s used to feeling powerful, and he finds it unfair that someone else — a woman he’d otherwise feel superior to — has more power than him, without “earning” it in a way he approves of. But he’s also angry because he’s a horror villain who’s stumbled into a superhero story. He sees himself as in control, until the darn superheroes get in the way.,Jessica Jones, for her part, often feels like a superhero who’s wandered into a horror narrative. She tries to fight for truth and justice, but like most people’s powers, hers are limited. She’s cynical, bad-tempered, and often drunk because she’s trying to be a hero in a world that has its teeth more than half-sunk into a different genre. It’s appropriate that the show has been the last Marvel Netflix series to be canceled. Jessica is a superhero familiar enough with horror to know that sometimes empowerment is just being the final girl standing."

That’s why he could return to direct ,, out this year. ,What the deal will give AT&T and WarnerMedia is a first look deal at anything Bad Robot produces, ,. The deal covers “movies, television shows, video games, consumer products, music and digital content for a WarnerMedia streaming service set to arrive early next year,” the ,reports.

Abrams’ Bad Robot is currently working on the third season of HBO’s , (HBO is a subsidiary of WarnerMedia), and it’s fair to assume that will continue under the agreement because it’s a WarnerMedia property. ,Another question is whether this move will make AT&T shareholders happy, which could affect the company’s ability to make other such deals and purchases. Multiple reports about investor concerns over AT&T’s WarnerMedia plan have come out over the last several months, as analysts worry , The company is currently $171 billion in debt, which ,. Wells Fargo lead analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a 2018 report that “we remain somewhat concerned about how AT&T will prioritize its near-term uses of cash.” ,Other analysts are concerned about WarnerMedia’s ability to create original content that will bring subscribers in — and keep them. WarnerMedia has an extensive catalogue of movies and shows, including ,a , to keep for one year, but there’s concern over WarnerMedia’s ability to produce that original content. ,Investing $500 million into Bad Robot and Abrams may be one way to quell those concerns, but it’s a large number — more than any of the aforementioned companies has paid for a single creative individual at this point. The company also recently signed lucrative deals with Mindy Kaling (,) and Ava DuVernay (,). The company is reportedly trying to secure a new deal for ,creator Chuck Lorre, whose deal with Warner Bros. TV ends in 2020. ,WarnerMedia is expected to launch its subscription streaming service this fall, and “keeping Abrams in the fold was considered a high priority for the independent studio,” according to the ,Although there isn’t any confirmed launch date or pricing, it’s expected to , That puts it on the higher end of streaming service costs, but it will include a subscription to HBO Now, which is currently $15.

William Sylvester, best known for playing Dr. Heywood Floyd in ,, is an American journalist who brings his girlfriend Marianne (Yvonne Romain) to one of Vorelli’s shows where she falls under his hypnotic spell.

Starz’s new series The Rook lacks the magic of the book it adapts,"
          Jun 25, 2019,  1:10pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"The world of Daniel O’Malley’s 2012 novel ,is a weird place. The Checquy — a secret wing of British intelligence comprised of elite bureaucrats, people with supernatural powers, and at least one vampire — protects the UK from harpy attacks, excavates buried dragon eggs, and deals with neighbors complaining about loud chanting happening next door. Most of the book is dedicated to the organization’s fight against a group of Belgian mad scientists who previously invaded England with an army of monsters made by manipulating flesh and bone.,Unfortunately, none of that flavor has made it into Starz’s adaptation of ,, which debuts on June 30th. While it’s understandable that the network didn’t want to spend the money needed to capture the book’s “,, but fantasy” feel, they’ve lost sight of the quirky absurdity that made it a compelling read. What’s left is just another show about what the world might be like if some people had superpowers.,The show’s version of the Checquy is just devoted to monitoring people with Extreme Variant Abilities (dubbed EVAs), recruiting them into the organization, and fighting human traffickers who capture them and sell them to the highest bidder. This isn’t a new idea: the X-Men’s Weapon X project covered the same ground, , has a similar plotline, and a metahuman trafficking ring played a major role in season 4 of CW’s ,. The twist here is that the Checquy seems to be just as bad as the metahuman-hunting Vultures. The Vultures sell kids with powers, but the Checquy takes them from their families and uses unethical means to enhance their abilities to make them useful assets.,The “both sides are bad” approach is meant to create an impossible situation for protagonist Myfanwy Thomas (Emma Greenwell), who wakes up surrounded by dead Vultures with no memory of who she is or what happened to her. She discovers she’s a high-ranking member of the Checquy — a Rook, in accordance with their tradition of giving people chess-based titles — and she learns she can’t trust anyone. That’s a fine neo-noir setup, but ,lacks the sharp writing or nuanced characters needed to make that genre work.,O’Malley’s book is a power fantasy where Myfanwy’s amnesia strips her of all her doubts and trauma, and lets her unlock her true potential. Myfanwy was such an ultra-competent organizer that when she learned she was going to lose her memory, she set her new self up with all the information and resources she’d need.,But in the show, Myfanwy was and remains a neurotic, anxious mess who needs to figure most things out for herself. She’s been newly buried under extra servings of trauma and mental illness. Showrunners Lisa Zwerling and Karyn Usher might have wanted to avoid relying on voiceover narration as Myfanwy reads letters from herself, but the close-up shots of her scrolling through Google searches, reading conspiracy-theory message boards, and scanning redacted medical files are just as dull.,Almost all of O’Malley’s book follows Myfanwy’s perspective, but Zwerling and Usher have taken an ensemble approach without doing any of the character-building necessary to make that work. The Chequay’s King Linda Farrier (Joely Richardson of ,and ,) and Queen Conrad Grantchester (Adrian Lester) are jockeying for power by withholding information and using the secrets they do have as leverage, but their intrigue and power-plays feel clumsy and hollow, easy to trace back to their source or refute. It’s also hard to care who comes out on top, since they seem to have no discernible character traits, besides being manipulative and dedicated to their jobs.,Zwerling and Usher have trimmed away some of the extraneous Checquy members from the book, but they’ve elevated minor character Monica Reed (Olivia Munn of ,) to become a super-strong agent from America’s equivalent of the Checquy. When Monica comes to the UK, tracking her former partner and lover, she barges around demanding everyone respect her and give her all the resources she needs, while doing almost nothing to justify herself, besides making incredibly transparent attempts at empathy and flattery. She spends most of the first four episodes of the eight-episode series entirely disconnected from the rest of the main cast, which makes her feel even more unnecessary.,’s one standout character and performance comes from Gestalt, a Checquy agent who is one consciousness spread across the bodies of two identical twins (Jon Fletcher) and two fraternal ones (Catherine Steadman and Ronan Raftery). While the writers rely a bit too much on creepy twin tropes, like having the siblings talk in unison or finish each other’s sentences, they also provide even more unsettling moments, like Myfanwy starting a conversation with one version, walking down the hall, then continuing her chat with another sibling. A scene showing Gestalt’s morning routine provides a fascinating perversion of the visual shorthands used to show intimacy, as the siblings help each other dress and sit down at the breakfast table without speaking. They’re together, yet fundamentally alone.,Visually, ,is as bland as Myfanwy’s wardrobe, which ranges from beige to gray. The directors are much too fond of drone shots showing the London skyline and its busy streets. They’re attempting to establish a sense of place, but their world feels devoid of meaning, since all the characters are devoted to a singular crisis for the first half of the season, leaving it remarkably unclear what the Checquy does on a day-to-day basis. This is also a show about people with superpowers, with basically no special effects. Instead, awkward close-ups on Conrad’s eyes or Myfanwy’s hands are used to demonstrate that they’re using powers, which have no visual effect until the people they’re attacking keel over. There’s very little action, aside from some chase scenes, though one involving Gestalt’s various bodies working in unison to protect Myfanwy further establishes that character as the best part of the show.,O’Malley’s book is far from perfect. The prose skews solidly toward the male gaze, as Myfanwy regularly spends time assessing the attractiveness of the women around her, and comparing them to her own perceived shortcomings. But while the show’s lack of internal monologue has excised that element, it’s been replaced by awful attempts to use sexual innuendo to lighten the otherwise bleak script. When Monica is asked, in an otherwise emotionally tense scene, whether she has a picture of her partner, she replies “I’m guessing you mean his face?”,Overall, ,feels like a missed opportunity, departing so far from its source material that it’s lost its identity, while failing to build a new one that justifies its existence. Shows like , and ,did a much better job with stories of people with superpowers trying to find their way in the world — those series have better writing, nuanced characters, and concrete ideas about what their characters’ abilities mean for the human experience.

          Jun 22, 2019,  1:00pm EDT
        ",Bijan Stephen," has returned for a second life on Netflix, legally available for the first time in a couple decades. Watching , in 2019 is fascinating for a number of reasons — namely, seeing what a new generation of people will make of the show — but the most interesting is the new world it’s been released back into. The anime was always apt, but in the two decades since the original series was first broadcast on TV Tokyo, it’s become the ideal anime for our time; thematically, the series is about the awful courage needed to stop an oncoming apocalypse, and what the people charged with protecting everyone else are obliged to cope with. , was critically acclaimed and beloved on its release (aside from the last two episodes, which were to put it mildly, ,) both because it was a dense work of psychological fiction and because people could recognize it as a genuine artistic achievement. In 1995, when it was released, the western world was relatively prosperous and stable; Japan, however, ,, which, that close to the end of the millennium, must have felt like the first rumblings of doomsday. Hideaki Anno’s masterpiece came into that void and had something to say about depression, cataclysm, and what it costs to save the world. ,The plot goes something like this: Shinji is a 14-year-old boy who’s been conscripted by his estranged father, who runs a secret intergovernmental agency, to pilot an Evangelion, one of the titular giant robots. The organization’s purpose is to defeat the Angels — equally large aliens that are hellbent on destroying the human race — and the Evangelions are humanity’s final weapon, the only thing that’s strong enough to destroy them. Shinji ,. And yet he has to, or humans are doomed. ,While the show was always very good at synthesizing its philosophical influences into a coherent, cohesive whole, the fourth episode in particular does this quite well; it’s one of the earliest signs that , is not just another fable about giant mechs and even bigger monsters. In episode four, we find Shinji breaking down from the stress of piloting the horribly beautiful EVA Unit 01, from fighting Angels. He runs away from the apartment he’s sharing with his guardian, Misato, and into the field surrounding Tokyo-3, the city built for the fight against the Angels. (And I mean: can you blame him? That’s a lot of stress for one hormonal teenager.) ,This is one of the great tensions of the series: Shinji doesn’t want to fight and potentially die, but he has to. Only certain people can pilot the EVAs, and he’s drawn a cosmically short straw. Shinji returns to the city eventually, recaptured by the shadowy organization. He has a conversation with Misato (who also happens to be his boss) in which she forces his resignation because he doesn’t have the right attitude to be a pilot; she seems to think he needs to be more enthusiastic about saving humanity. There’s a beautiful shot of him at the train station, missing the train back to his former life, and being welcomed back by Misato to the only real home he’s ever known. He gets back in the proverbial robot.,That’s a , brief summary of the episode’s plot, but what’s really interesting here is the way , depicts that emotional shift to the audience. It uses , — an example drawn from the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer’s ,(1851), the last major work he published before he died — to make a smart point about intimacy. The dilemma, in brief: it’s a cold day, and a group of hedgehogs is huddled together for warmth. The problem is that the closer they get the more their quills prick. The idea, naturally, is that humans work the same way: intimacy is often quite painful. ,Shinji doesn’t really have anyone close to him, and therefore for him any kind of intimacy is as unbearable as the loneliness he can’t escape. (His father is the head of that aforementioned shadowy intergovernmental organization, and he transparently doesn’t care about Shinji’s well-being; his mother is dead.) He can’t seem to connect with his classmates, and he’s afraid to let Misato care for him because she doesn’t, at this juncture, seem emotionally capable of it — she’s an avatar of the work he hates and yet is compelled to do. Because again: everyone will die. And that, to Shinji, is the most unbearable thought of all.,Currently, we are facing our own seemingly intractable — but ultimately solvable — problems, much as Shinji faces the Angels. Right-wing authoritarianism is on the rise around the globe; climate change, still unchecked, is beginning to ravage the planet; and economic inequality is more visible than it’s ever been before. There are concentration camps in America, and there is a government agency tasked with conducting raids of unsuspecting immigrant families and capturing the ones without what the government deems correct paperwork. The president has personally approved this. Things are bad, and they are getting almost unstoppably worse. Morally and physically, the world is on the brink of disaster. ,Here, Shinji’s reaction in episode four — which, by the way, is called “Hedgehog’s Dilemma” — is instructive. Stress leads him to flee, to look away from the fights to come; but he returns in the end because of his moral obligation to the rest of society. I don’t think, in the end, that he returns out of a noble sense of duty. Shinji returns because he’s betting on the small chance that he, a hedgehog, can move a little closer to Misato and, through her, to the rest of humanity.,Watching it now is unsettling because of how timely it feels. The idea that we are required to help the people who can’t help themselves — anyone materially threatened by the current regime — is powerfully resonant. It feels like an emotional guide for what to do next. ,Nowadays, it also feels like social media has turned the experience of using the internet into its own kind of society-wide hedgehog’s dilemma; private abuses can be broadcast to a global audience instantly, and that is its own terrible intimacy. When ,, for example, or when police shoot unarmed black civilians, to take another, more common scenario, we hear about it through platforms like Twitter and Facebook; we’re close enough now to feel the spines.,And it is unbearable. It is an unbearably intimate thing to see or to hear about. Another example. The other day I saw a video in one of my various feeds, of white cops beating a restrained and hooded man. It began to autoplay, and what I saw was abjectly horrifying. ,The strange thing, however, was that watching the video felt in a way like bearing witness. It was as though I’d come face-to-face with the unedited present; I understood that a version of that beating — comparatively mild, in the grand scheme of things — was playing out in various unseen ways across the country. It is not so often that you witness someone exercising power over another person when they’re not afraid of the consequences of being watched. ,Shinji never becomes a righteous, unafraid hero. He can’t help but be himself; he can’t help feeling terrified and powerless every time he enters his EVA before a battle with an unknown and unknowable Angel. And here, I think, is the final lesson: intimacy is painful, but the warmth that’s possible when people draw together is worth fighting for. Even if you’re afraid, and especially if you feel powerless. We don’t have to change ourselves to fight. The prick of those spines should spur us into collective action."

It’s such a stunningly confident intro, too, that you go into the movie with an immediate sense of awe and wonder.,My favorite instance of this kind of storytelling, though, is a brief gag in the middle of the movie, where a naked man sits down beside the protagonist on a bench.

An animated adaptation of Chinese sci-fi novel The Three-Body Problem is in development,"

A source confirmed to , that the form is legitimate and that the company has been working on developing the series. Should the series begin filming, this development would be the latest step forward in adapting the novels for film or television. ,This particular adaptation also appears to be an animated one, ,. People familiar with the situation confirmed its authenticity, though they indicated that it’s unclear if the project will be completed, or if it is, if what this video shows will be close to the final version. ,Written by Cixin Liu in 2006 — and translated into English in 2014 by Ken Liu —  , was a breakout hit from China’s science fiction scene, winning the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2015. It begins during China’s Cultural Revolution when a dissident scientist is exiled to a remote research facility. While conducting research, she makes first contact with a hostile alien species known as the Trisolarans that live on a planet in a chaotic solar system and immediately make plans to take over the Earth. In the modern day, the novel follows a professor and a detective who are investigating the deaths of several scientists, and they discover a group forming to prepare for the arrival of the Trisolarans.,The book is the first of an ambitious trilogy (,, followed by , and ,), in which Liu explores not only the impending invasion of the Trisolarans, but the brutal nature of the universe as other advanced alien species compete for space and power, stretching all the way to the end of time.

Russell T. Davies’ miniseries Years and Years is Black Mirror with a heart,"
          Jun 24, 2019,  4:18pm EDT
        ",Liz Shannon Miller,"The easy pitch for the new HBO / BBC co-production , might be “What if ,, but a family drama?” But the more accurate pitch might be “What if ,, but with a full and beating heart?” That isn’t intended as a slam on Charlie Brooker’s anthology series about dystopian futures. It’s more of an appreciation of what creator Russell T. Davies has been able to achieve with his six-episode limited series, premiering Monday, June 24th on HBO. (Its run on BBC One recently concluded.), begins in 2019, with a focus on the complicated intergenerational Lyons clan: Muriel (Anne Reid), her grandchildren Edith (Jessica Hynes), Stephen (Rory Kinnear), Daniel (Russell Tovey), and Rosie (Ruth Madeley), and their assorted spouses and children, including Stephen’s wife Celeste (T’Nia Miller), and their daughter Bethany (Lydia West). The story begins simply for these Britons, with the birth of Rosie’s second son, Lincoln, and the first public appearance of rising UK politician Vivian Rook (Emma Thompson). But then the show rockets into the future, in progressive leaps toward the year 2034. The segments along the way track the dramatic changes to global politics and technology, and consider how they affect the Lyons family.,The impact of international events on individual lives is a key aspect of the series, and it gives , much of its subtle (and overt) power. It’s one thing to see a report on a country’s banking crisis, and another to watch an increasingly familiar family lose their home as a result. Hearing about refugees being deported is an abstraction — watching a loving couple forcibly separated by the government is a powerful, empathy-driving moment.,Using the Lyons family as a magnifying glass for current events gives , a shocking immediacy. Over the course of six episodes, it builds up horror about what may come in the next 15 years. But it also brings in inklings of wonder and hope, taking a positive view about what humanity is capable of even in the darkest times.,Much as in ,, technology isn’t the enemy in ,. As time passes, both mobile and desktop interfaces enter the third dimension and become embeddable in the human brain, the shifting nature of agriculture leads to the evolution of synthetic food and beverages, and even the ways people lay their loved ones to rest starts to change. But innovations and changing technology aren’t Davies’ focus here, even on an allegorical level. The changes in the world are part and parcel of a story that’s deeply rooted in its characters.,It’s a unique, inclusive brew of characters, too, brought to life by a deep bench of a cast. Emma Thompson is arresting in her brief screen time as a political figure whose inner life remains a mystery. She’s a politician for a modern, Trump-centric age: a maverick who makes polarizing appearances and uses extreme media savvy to claim center stage. She isn’t the series star, though — that’s a title any of the ensemble actors could claim, given the caliber of the cast and the distribution of the plot focus.,Tovey, as a council official who upheaves his comfortable relationship for a newfound passion, carries a lot of the show’s heart with him. Hynes fully embodies the role of fearless rebel, as an activist whose determination to fight the world is balanced perfectly against Kinnear and Miller, playing parents who just want to craft the best life possible for their teenage daughters. And Reid as the family matriarch is given clichéd moments that can only be followed up by, “Oh, silly gran” — but she also gets some of the series’ most haunting monologues, capturing the anxiety and nostalgia of the older generation, flustered by increasingly tougher times.,Many family dramas have difficulties with inclusive casting, but on ,, Davies puts in the effort to avoid that, and not just around racial representation. Wheelchair-user Madeley is a charming, compelling performer who deserves to get a lot more work. Lydia West as Stephen and Celeste’s young daughter Bethany, who initially aspires to a transhumanism lifestyle, is just beginning her career. But her bright energy and ability to show Bethany’s evolution from angry teenager to confident young woman indicates her real potential to become a major breakout star.,Davies, meanwhile, has had a long career as a TV writer, working since the early 1990s in a variety of genres before becoming key to several iconic series. For fans of Davies’ writing through his creation of the groundbreaking, soulful character romp ,, or his role in reviving the iconic British series , for the modern TV world, ,’ inherent darkness might prove startling.,But one of Davies’ most profound works as a writer was the season 4 , episode “Turn Left,” which features an alternate reality in which the Doctor (David Tennant, at the time) dies before his time, and the entire universe slowly but surely turns to garbage as a result. “Turn Left” doesn’t skimp on the dystopia, and one of its focuses is the rising xenophobia that eventually leads to non-British citizens being imprisoned in camps. “Turn Left,” which aired in 2008, now looks prescient.,Camps for refugees are a major factor in , as well, which is where the show hits one of its biggest snags. Watching debates set in the future over internment camps for refugees feels out of step with the fact that at this exact moment in time, Americans are debating , is applicable to the containment zones the United States government has created for asylum-seekers. ,While the show is set in the future, many of the steadily dropping dominos which lead to the increasing darkness of this series — especially when it comes to the political rise of extremist governments and the growingly unavoidable threat of climate change — are vivid present concerns, not future ones. The discussions they inspire in the show have real impact, but they sometimes clash with the idea that this is a possible consequence hanging over us, rather than a showcase of where we already are today.,The immediate relevance of ,’ political plotlines does drive a strong emotional engagement with the series, though. Davies may not be imaginative enough about what the future might hold, but he is addressing current events with an immediate, raw vividness. With every big monologue and montage of world events, his series conveys a deeply embedded frustration that permeates nearly every scene and speech. That voice is hoarse, tired of shouting about the icecaps, extremist politics, and the way empathy for others keeps shrinking as life gets tougher, and human interactions become more transactional.,But , still takes time for a moment of drunken joy, set to the indefatigable musical stylings of Chumbawamba. It isn’t a show about the inevitable horrors of the future, it’s about a family trying its best to muddle through them. And even the worst characters, making their worst choices, are clearly and richly human, in a way that underlines the need for empathy and understanding. , ,, in spite of Thompson’s star power, and it may be in danger of slipping under the radar in America as well. (Maybe not enough people watched Jessica Hynes in the classic British sitcom ,, or appreciated Russell Tovey’s work in HBO’s ,) But it deserves more attention, both for its execution and for its good intentions.,Over five seasons and various special episodes, , has used its roughly hourlong format to engage audiences with standalone scenarios about how technology is affecting us now, and how that might play out in the future. But , uses the very specific problems of the Lyons family to make viewers examine, in a general way, how choices made today affect tomorrow. The series suggests that change is only possible when people take conscious, decisive action — even if only by making sure they’re paying attention to what’s going on without them. Not everyone will engage with this show’s message, but given how loudly it’s shouting, people should take this moment — this relevant political moment — to listen to what Davies,is saying."
So you watched Neon Genesis Evangelion — now what?,"
          Jun 25, 2019,  1:20pm EDT
        ",D. M. Moore,"So you watched all 26 episodes of , and the , movies on Netflix, but now you aren’t sure what to watch next. The good news is that in the more than 20 years since , originally aired, it’s become a seminal work of anime, and it inspired a lot of different animators, writers, and directors. They’ve built off what the series did, finding different ways to explore similar ideas in their own works.,One of ,’s strongest themes is about people making connections with each other. So much of the series is about the characters talking to each other but not really communicating. They struggle to convey what they’re feeling in meaningful ways and to be open with each other. (The series’s AT fields are physical manifestations of the barriers that keep people separated.) This ends up causing many characters’ downfalls and explaining why others are pursuing the Human Instrumentality Project to begin with. ,The difficulty of connection has been explored in a lot of different shows before and since. But here are some more recent shows that took it up in ways both more and less fantastical. They’re worth watching for people who are interested in ,’s themes and how they explore the human condition.,Coincidentally wrapping up just as , hit Netflix, , is the latest series from acclaimed director Kunihiko Ikuhara (,, ,). The series is about three middle school boys who run afoul of a mythical Japanese creature called a Kappa. The Kappa turns them into Kappas and offers to make them human again only after they defeat a “kappa zombie” that is magically stealing things from people in the city.,The show is a purposefully eccentric, confusing spectacle at the start. But over the course of the series, it begins to hone the importance of connections between people. It touches on the ways people can do terrible things to themselves and others because they feel like that’s the only way to stay connected.,Streaming dubbed on , and subtitled on ,., is about Yuta, a high schooler in a fictional Japanese city, who one day wakes up with no memories. He’s found by Rikka, a girl in his class, who takes him to her home where he sees visions in a computer of a strange robot who says that once he finishes his mission, he can return Yuta’s memories. That involves transforming Yuta into the giant superhero Gridman to fight kaiju that attack the city. Yuta, Rikka, and Yuta’s friend Sho start seeing giant kaiju that are frozen around their city, seemingly invisible to everyone else.,Most of the drama in each episode doesn’t have to do with fighting giant monsters. It’s more about the interpersonal relationships that develop as the characters learn more about why their world is the way it is. Like ,, the show slowly reveals what it’s really about: how to connect with and rely on other people.,Streaming dubbed on , and subtitled on ,.,Set in a fictional future Japanese city, the story follows seven high schoolers who are linked by something called the Kizna System, which runs throughout the city. The system makes it so that they each feel the physical and emotional pain the others experience. The makers of the system hope it can help people — even those with very different lives — empathize and bond.,The series was written by Mari Okada (,) whose work frequently touches on themes of connecting and opening up. Like ,, , was animated at studio Trigger. But unlike , and the other series on this list, , makes this theme part of the show’s text, rather than the subtext. That lets Okada explore it differently. She’s able to more explicitly show how trying not to connect or holding something painful in can hurt other people as much as it hurts the person who’s holding back.,Streaming dubbed and subtitled on ,.,Moriko is 30 and an incredibly successful career woman, but she quits her overly stressful job suddenly to spend her life living alone and playing video games. She starts playing an MMORPG where she makes a male character and befriends a high-level female character named Lily who invites her to join her guild. In the real world, Moriko keeps running into a young businessman named Yuta, who, unknown to her, is Lily’s player., is a rom-com with much of the humor and drama coming from the duality of identity both online and in person. But it also uses those moments to explore how connections to people online aren’t any more or less real than in-person interactions, especially as the lines separating characters from players start to blur.,Streaming dubbed and subtitled on ,.,Subaru is a 23-year-old reclusive writer who lives alone in his family home after his parents died in an accident while traveling. While he’s visiting their graves, he happens upon a small stray cat that he ends up taking home with him and naming Haru. Unsure of how to take care of Haru, he ends up relying more on the people in his life and befriending new ones.,At first blush, this series seems like it’s just going to be a cute show about a guy and his new cat. While it has moments like that, it’s actually about Subaru and Haru helping each other work through their own trauma and anxieties. While they don’t fully understand each other, their connection helps Subaru connect and open up more with the people around him.,Streaming dubbed on , and subtitled on ,.,Akira was a star of the high school track team until a leg injury sidelined her, which causes her to fall into a depression. After a doctor’s appointment, she visits a family restaurant to wait out a rainstorm, and the store manager, middle-aged divorcee Masami, gives her some coffee on the house while she waits. This act of kindness causes her to develop a crush on him, and she gets a job working at the restaurant part-time to get close to him.,While this sort of age difference in relationships can be problematic in the real world, here, it never develops beyond a one-sided longing. Even so, Akira and Masami’s connection helps both of them get out of the ruts they’ve fallen into and pushes them to start reconnecting with people they’ve neglected. Akira starts seeing a life beyond track and her injury, while Masami gets back the confidence and self-worth he lost after his divorce.,Streaming subtitled on ,.,When Shoya was in elementary school, a deaf girl named Shoko joined his class. Shoya and some of the other kids bullied her, which eventually reaches the principal. Shoya becomes the class scapegoat, his peers ostracize him, and he isolates himself out of guilt. This continues into high school when he happens upon Shoko again. Having learned some sign language since elementary school, he tries to make amends., explores connecting with other people through nonverbal communication, most of which goes beyond sign language. To quote from , when ,came to North American theaters, “It also comes across in the way characters change their hairstyles to be more confident and more appealing to their crushes. Or the way Shoko’s younger sister takes pictures of dead animals and puts them up all over their shared apartment. That initially just seems like a weird personality quirk. But it brings across something she’s trying to communicate to Shoko without actually coming out and saying it.” The movie shows that connecting with other people can be hard because communicating is difficult at the best of times.,Streaming dubbed and subtitled on ,."

A lot of people were waiting for this moment, hoping the movie would be as great as the original.,And while they were spared a crushing disappointment, the first half of 2019 has still been bittersweet for nostalgic TV-watchers. After Fox canceled the dearly beloved but low-rated sitcom , last year, NBC picked it up, and starting in January 2019, the network started airing new episodes that are every bit as heartfelt and funny as the show’s best.

Nobody is eager to say goodbye to their TV friends, and the success of fan campaigns to bring back shows like , have emboldened fans to the point where they expect to be heard — especially when the people behind a canceled series are also actively pushing to continue their planned story. ,But while revivals and reboots tend to arrive with a lot of joyous fanfare, not all of them are ultimately successful, either commercially or creatively. They fail for a variety of reasons: sometimes so much time has gone by since the show’s original era that its dynamic or characters seem quaint and out of place. Sometimes the creators have different agendas than the fans. Sometimes a show like ,returns, and the alchemy that made it work in the first place just isn’t there anymore, and everything feels… off.,But sometimes, everything falls into place, just as fans hoped — or at least ,into place that they don’t feel cheated. Which is why fans keep pushing, even though they so rarely get exactly what they want. Here are a few of the common pros and cons of bringing back a canceled series.,For fans of a given show, this is often the main reason to root for a revival, whether it’s a direct continuation, a spinoff sequel, or a reunion movie. , fans are eager to catch up with Lorelai and Rory. ,obsessives are excited to see Mulder and Scully again. , lovers are happy to see more of Leela and Fry.,Television networks and writer / producers have fed off this nostalgic warmth for decades. Back in the late 20th century, they used to exploit it in more roundabout ways — most often via retrospective specials and TV movies, where characters like Perry Mason or the Brady family returned to action for a night. Sometimes when these one-offs did well enough, they led to more. NBC kept running new , movies throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, until star Raymond Burr died. Between 1989 and 2003, ABC aired new , movies, some of which were as good as the classic 1970s episodes.,TV creators have also kept fans’ favorite characters alive through spinoffs like ,, which carried on strong for a decade after ,. Two of the best dramas on television today are, ostensibly, revivals via spinoff. The , prequel , and ,sequel , only share a few key characters with their parent shows, but tell the same kinds of stories with similar themes. Audiences who followed the originals closely are delighted to have them around., writer / producer Mitchell Hurwitz made a lot of mistakes with the Netflix version of his show, but one of the biggest issues was beyond his control. Some of his core cast-members, including Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, Tony Hale, and Michael Cera, built thriving careers off the foundation of their ,work. That makes it harder to see their faces and hear their voices now without thinking of all the similar characters they’ve played since, from Bateman’s self-absorbed dorks in movies like , to Hale’s nebbish assistant on ,.,And then there’s the case of Jeffrey Tambor who, between the cancellation of , and its Netflix return, took on what looked like it was going to be his career-defining part as Maura in the award-winning Amazon dramedy ,. But just before , came back, Tambor was , over issues of sexual harassment and general boorishness. The behind-the-scenes information made it harder to enjoy Tambor’s work, for the same reasons that , soured her , comeback in 2018.,British television tends to handle the revival conundrum well by keeping TV series’ individual seasons short and self-contained, and by only producing new ones when inspiration strikes. It’s not uncommon in the UK for years to pass between seasons, and for the later iterations to take advantage of this time off, by updating the material to reflect a changing world. Steve Coogan’s , over the course of nearly 30 years are a good case in point. His pompous broadcaster character remains a twit throughout each new installment, but Partridge’s career is a bit different each time, depending on whether his brand of windbaggery is in fashion in the real world.,The teams behind , and , took different approaches to updating their respective universes. David Lynch introduced more modern technology to the retro world of ,, then just kept on going, tilting into the realm of science fiction with his super-advanced crime-labs and stealth communication devices. He and Mark Frost made little effort to reflect current reality accurately for their 2017 revival of the show, but they did make sure to distinguish the 2010s from the 1990s, when the original show first aired. , writers, meanwhile, included episodes in the most recent season that dealt with the likes of AI, algorithms, and “fake news” in ways that were ,.,One concession to modernity both , and , made was to use the latest cameras and lighting rigs, which in both cases gave the shows a visual style markedly different from the way they appeared on TV in the 1990s. Their daytime images looked brighter and flatter; their nighttime images looked darker and sparer. Neither show suffered dramatically from the changes, but it did take some adjustment to get used to the new look.,The same was true of the , movie, ,, which made the world of that show look more expensive and cinematic, to some extent working against the ramshackle charm of the TV version. Netflix’s revival of , disappointed some fans with its movie-like narrative structure, and its frequent trips outside of the enchanting tourist town of Stars Hollow. CBS All Access’ , reboot is taking a more TV-MA approach to Rod Serling’s original, which sometimes makes the science-fiction / horror anthology feel newly relevant, but at times just makes it seem more vulgar.,Even with the old , TV movies, the look of those new episodes (shot in color instead of in black and white, and set mostly in Colorado instead of Los Angeles), and the changes in tone (with storylines often a little racier or more violent than the original) makes those later adventures more of a curiosity than a must-see.,The ABC sitcom , never became a sensation during its three years on network TV, and after it moved to TBS for three more seasons, its viewership dropped to around 2 million per episode. But those 2 million were thrilled that one of the most amiable, light-hearted hangout comedies of its era had stuck around for a few extra years. It was like a little unexpected gift, every week that ,’s cast of goofy Floridians was still on the air.,This is the way it’s supposed to work whenever fans push for a canceled show to come back. When the people who make the series are as excited and inspired as their viewers, it’s hard for either side to complain about getting more of a good thing. See also: the latest version of ,, or the , movie, both of which happened in large part due to fans contributing to crowdfunding campaigns.,On the other hand, not every ,buff is totally on board with the new Netflix version of the show, which features a different host and a tweaked concept. A number of , fans were let down by the movie, disagreeing with how the heroine’s life and relationships had changed since her college years. The eccentric sitcom , had a strong final season after it moved to the streaming service Yahoo! Screen, but not enough of the people who watched the series religiously on NBC followed it to its new home — in part because of the obscurity of the platform, and in part because not all of the original cast made the transition.,The immediate rush of seeing old favorites from , or , back on the big screen often gives way to a return of all of the old online arguments about what these characters should be doing and who they should be dating. Sometimes it might be better just to let the fan-fic crowd keep telling the version of the story that’s in their heads, rather than disappointing them by going in a different direction.,Some of the most successful revivals — from a creative perspective, that is — have been the ones where production barely skipped a beat. , moved seamlessly from ABC to NBC for its final season in 1982. , shifted from The WB to UPN for its last two years. , jumped from CBS to The CW immediately after its last season. , slid right over from Fox to NBC this year.,Not much was lost in any of those cases. , had to move its production from California to Canada, and say goodbye to Calista Flockhart, whose contract stipulated that she had to be based in Los Angeles. But for the most part, a machine that was already rolling along just kept chugging.,And in April, in a story about TV’s most powerful producers, , , , creator Dan Fogelman may use his newfound clout to revive his acclaimed baseball drama ,, canceled in 2017 after one short season. When a series has that kind of talented creative team, and devoted fans (no matter how few in number), it’s heartbreaking to see it yanked off the air due to network balance sheets not lining up. Even from a business point of view, there are reasons to eke out a few more seasons of a show on a new network. How much more money have the people who own pieces of ,, ,, ,and , earned over the years thanks to having more episodes to sell?,The CW’s , ended this spring, and ,will wrap up in July. In both cases, their creators decided it was time to wrap them up, though the fact that neither show was ever a massive hit may have been a factor. And that’s okay! As much as fans of both shows might want them to keep running indefinitely, it’s good that both can finish their runs on terms that satisfy their networks , their producers. That’s pretty rare for the TV business.,Even shows pulled after one or two seasons of dire ratings may sometimes be better off as monuments to their own potential. ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, even , (movie notwithstanding)… These series never had a chance to let their devotees down, because they were yanked off the air while they were still great.,This doesn’t mean that people who dearly missed , shouldn’t have pushed for the movie, or shouldn’t be grateful that they finally got it. But just imagine how revered , would still be if Netflix had never “saved” it. Maybe some wishes weren’t meant to come true."

It has some really relaxed and quirky behind-the-scenes footage of Dylan and the (often famous) people around him, along with some great performances.,But there’s one thing about the documentary that is completely bizarre: ,. Scorsese introduces viewers to a handful of talking heads who say they played a key role in documenting or creating the tour Dylan is embarking on, but in reality, they’re just actors.,It’s not really clear why Scorsese did this (maybe it would be clearer if I had finished the film, but reviewers seem to say otherwise). It’s sort of just a prank, one you could seemingly go without finding out about. I love the idea of it — there has to be some kind of documentary-esque story that could use this technique to make a compelling larger point. But here? I’m still not sure what it accomplished other than getting us talking.,Check out seven trailers from this week below.,All the trailers for , have felt like the kind of trailer you make when you’re extremely confident you’ve got a blast of a movie on your hands. This final trailer spends almost half of its time on a tense, cleanly shot action sequence that seems to be exactly what , fans are looking for out of this spinoff. It comes out August 2nd. ,Elizabeth Banks is rebooting , with a film that she wrote, directed, and even acts in. Coming from Banks, it’s no surprise to find the reboot putting a lot more comedy into the mix with all the spy stuff. The film comes out in November.,Lena Waithe is the writer behind this gorgeous, somber-looking film about a black couple who go on the run after an aggressive police encounter ends with one of them shooting and killing a cop in defense. The film is directed by Melina Matsoukas, who made Beyoncé’s “Formation” video, and it looks like a very different take on the aftermath story of a police shooting. It comes out November 27th.,This film has been shuffled around for a couple years now after the end of The Weinstein Company disrupted the initial release plans for it. Reviews haven’t been great, which probably speaks to the lack of urgency to get the movie into theaters, but I feel like with this many stars and a general cultural awareness in the whole Tesla vs. Edison thing, there ought to be some interest. The movie finally comes out in October.,Amazon has a documentary series coming up about rapper Meek Mill’s struggle to escape the criminal justice system and the movement that emerged because of and in support of him. Jay-Z both appears and is an executive producer of the series. It comes out August 9th.,I’ll admit, I thought this one was going to be boring because it starts out with a romance between two people with very white hair, but it quickly turns into a tense thriller about a con man trying to pull one over on a particularly wealthy woman. It comes out November 15th.,The next big blockbuster from , director Roland Emmerich is a very CGI-heavy film about Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway. I’m not really sure how much appetite there is for another kind of generic, explosion-heavy World War II film, but then again, I guess that’s basically the reason Emmerich has a career. The film comes out November 8th."

        ",Andrew Liptak,"Apple’s head of services and programming says that the company has adopted a quality-over-quantity mindset when it comes to its forthcoming Apple TV Plus service. This weekend, , with Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, in which he talks about what to expect from the service forthcoming service, which is expected to launch later this fall. ,The revelation is a rebuke to Netflix programming model: releasing as much original content as it can to attract viewers. In the interview, Cue says that Apple won’t be “creating the most” original content for users, but will be “creating the best.” When asked about Netflix’s model, he notes that there’s “nothing wrong with that model, but it’s not our model.” ,Apple is a latecomer to the streaming video industry, following companies such as Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix, which have already pulled in legions of loyal users, in part due to their efforts to produce their original content. Other media conglomerates are jumping in as well: Disney, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. have all announced their own platforms, which will launch this year and next. ,Cue notes that Apple hasn’t always been the leader when it comes to hardware, pointing out that they weren’t the first to produce computers, smartphones, or tablets. “We try to be the best, and we don’t have to be the first to be the best,” he said. He explains that while Apple doesn’t “know a lot about television other than we are big consumers of it,” what it does do is “find the best people for it.” The company brought on high-profile Hollywood executives, , (formerly of Sony), as well as , (formerly of the UK’s Channel 4) to head up its television programming. ,Under them, the company has lined up an ,, with shows from people such as J.J.

Like a zombie show where the characters somehow do not know what zombies are, this little bit of irony is fun or grating, depending on the type of person you are. But hardly anyone wants to deal with an entire show full of that. ,, a new Netflix miniseries from Ryan Murphy, is an entire show full of that.,Murphy is perhaps the buzziest maker of television in the business. With this latest project, the writer / director (who co-created the series with frequent collaborator Ian Brennan), who is behind shows like , and , brings his distinct slick, sensational style to the Golden Age of showbiz. Bawdy and transgressive, it starts with a flair and energy that’s hard to look away from, tremendously watchable from minute one. Trouble is, it’s impossible to parse what the show wants to even be ,.  , is an alt-history story about a cast of mostly fictional strivers trying to make it big in 1940s Los Angeles. Just about every core cast member we’re introduced to — writer Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope), director Raymond Ainsley (Darren Criss), actress Camille Washington (Laura Harrier), among others — are from marginalized backgrounds. They’re gay, women, not white, or some combination of the three. They are, by design, people who would have never, ever stood a chance in Old Hollywood, at least not without finding some way to pass. This is the first aim of the show: a rewrite of the well-worn dream-big story, but one starring people who weren’t allowed to be a part of it, and one where they win. ,But the series isn’t just a rosy what-if fable. ,also has ambitions of being a much-needed corrective to our overly simplistic view of the Hollywood that was. The show echoes works like , and the book / documentary ,, offering a look into a more hedonistic side of the Golden Age of show business. This Hollywood was not carefully laundered for mass consumption, a Dreamland where big-name stars had hookups arranged by fixers that conducted business out of a gas station front and secretly gay and bisexual actors and producers threw exclusive parties where they could be secrets no longer. ,In this, the miniseries wants to have its cake and eat it, too. , shows the era for its ugliness — the homophobia, racism, and sexism that shut out marginalized talent for decades — and dreams a new dream where it wasn’t enough to stop our heroes. But its other goal of disabusing viewers of the wholesome myth embodied by the films of the era gets incredibly messy fast. ,Part of the problem is that , is not entirely built around fictional characters. Real names enter and leave the drama throughout, from Hattie McDaniel (Queen Latifah) to Anna May Wong (Michelle Krusiec), real people who did the impossible present to bolster the egos of characters that never existed and therefore, arguably, their creators. Then there’s Henry Wilson (an impressively nasty Jim Parsons), a real-life talent agent who was famous for developing the era’s leading men. He was also, as ,makes , clear, alleged to be the Harvey Weinstein of his day, coercing young men into sex in exchange for parts and stardom. On the show, one of those men is the aspiring actor whom Wilson turns into Rock Hudson — a curious choice since the show barely seems interested in the real Rock Hudson’s biography. ,It’s hard not to see the twin ambitions of , as utterly at odds with each other. The truth-telling of its nastier side inspired by the real version of history undercuts the earnestness of its wish-fulfillment, making it seem cloying and saccharine. In turn, that earnest part of the show makes its forays into Old Hollywood’s real-world underbelly feel exploitative and cheap. There is too much friction between the two for them to build a cohesive whole, and, as a result, the whole enterprise is compromised at best and condescending at worst. ,Like most people involved in the Hollywood of the real world, the characters of , are utterly convinced that everything they’re doing is ,important. They make dreams real, you see, telling stories so that others can see them and be inspired to believe that they can do it, too. We , to have a version of this story where the marginalized succeed because we need them to inspire a more diverse future version of Hollywood so that Hollywood can go on. ,But the show ,wants you to know that it represents a business where abusers thrive, sex can be traded for power, and bigoted men can build systems that protect their interests and extend their reach. That’s just as much a part of show business as the brown kid who gets it in their head that they can make it, matter just as much as the white ones, and become an example that inspires countless others back home. It’s telling that while ,’s marginalized characters find success, its biggest abuser is ambiguously reformed, allowed to stay in the business of dreams after only a few scenes of feeling sorry about it all. ,These are two sides of the same coin: the pernicious reach of the powerful and the inspiring success stories that launder their reputation. In tying the two together once more, the series just props up the old system it thinks it’s subverting. Hollywood’s greatest production has always been Hollywood. "

How to be a Rick and Morty fan,"
          May  7, 2020,  9:58am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"After a mid-season hiatus, ,returned on May 3rd with the first of five episodes to close out its fourth season. The series is as good as it’s always been — shockingly crass but also sharp, easily one of the funniest and most inventive shows on television. As a cultural object, however, there have been problems around its fans. You know, they’re terrible.,It’s been ,, fueled by a comment that went viral on Reddit. “You have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty,” the post begins, claiming that much of its humor would go over the average viewer’s head. “People who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase ‘Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,’ which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic ,Like anything so obviously Online, it’s impossible to tell if this post is sincere or satire, but it definitely struck a chord. The fan reputation can be so prevailing that enjoying the show often feels as if you need to be at least a little self-aware in your fandom. When I asked a friend if he watched , a few weeks ago, he replied: “Yes, but wokely.” ,Part of that reputation is earned. , fans have a documented history of being extremely annoying — most notably, when an episode mentioned a discontinued McDonald’s Szechuan sauce and said fans began ,. (When the chain brought back the sauce for a limited time, fans were then upset ,.),But some of that reputation comes from the behind-the-scenes dynamic of the show; in the lead-up to season 2, , noted that there were no women on the writing staff, and creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon made jokes about it in response. ,“They make my wee-wee feel weird,” said Roiland. ,“I blame them for the inflation , the recession at the same time,” Harmon continued to riff. “They don’t ask for directions, and they leave the toilet seat down.”,After chalking it up to oversight, they corrected the writers’ room homogeneity by staffing Jane Becker, Erica Rosbe, Sarah Carbiener, and Jessica Gao in one big spree for the show’s third season. Misogynistic fans reacted predictably with much whining online that quickly gave way to actual harassment, compelling Harmon to ,. (Harmon, it should be noted, has also very publicly confronted ,.) The outrage was further proved baseless and embarrassing when Gao wrote “Pickle Rick,” one of the show’s fan-favorite episodes.,But fandoms don’t spring forth from the ether, and ,’s status as an Adult Swim show is part of the problem. Cartoon Network’s late-night programming block notoriously , for most of its existence, and former creative director Mike Lazzo ,. (Lazzo retired in December 2019.) It’s hard, then, to be surprised when the bulk of its audience isn’t supportive of people the network only showed interest in recently. ,Like working in an excellent cafe with poor ventilation, the stench of that grease clings to you, an unpleasant reminder of what was actually a pretty nice time. It can feel strange to publicly be into a show that has some truly bad fans — but it can be done if you are delicate about it and completely abandon the hard sell. No aggressive superlatives. Don’t call it “the best / funniest / smartest show on television,” even if you have a pretty solid argument for that. No shock and / or surprise that the other party hasn’t seen it yet or doesn’t know about parts that they would really enjoy.,Instead, focus on something specific and work on your noncommittal voice, like you’re trying to sound cool in high school by showing off how much you don’t actually care. Say you like , because it’s weird, and you like being surprised every time you hit play or that you just love trying to spot the voices of the , guest stars that roll through or that you really like gross jokes about farts and genitalia, and you didn’t know how clever someone could be with them until you saw ,. But say it all with a kind of shrug, like what you ,want to say is “just live your truth.”,Given the state of , fandom, this is probably the safest approach to practicing fandom: soft sells only. You don’t have to feel bad about liking it, but you don’t need to express pride in your good taste either. ,Rick and Morty,Hearthstone: Heroes of WarCraft,It can feel annoying to have to adjust your approach to account for the bad behavior of a subset of fans, but the whole point of being a (good, not-toxic) fan of something is sharing something you like with other people, and that means being concerned with how they think and feel first, and then showing them that they might enjoy the same things as you. While bad fans don’t have to be a reason for you to give up on something you like, they are a perfectly good reason for anyone else to not pay attention. ,This is the easiest way to transcend a fandom problem — by being a sort of anti-fan. Be quieter about it, less about “fandom” the concept and more about fandom as one of dozens of tiny connections you have with the things you enjoy. It’s nice to like things! It’s less nice to like them because ,Anyway, you should watch this ,show if you want. Dude turns himself into a pickle. He’s called Pickle Rick. It’s hilarious. No pressure, though. "

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"I watched HBO’s new film , last week. The whole thing felt a bit like a heist movie in reverse — it’s about a superintendent who’s stealing money from his school district, only you’re watching as the crime unravels, rather than as it plays out.,It’s a fun film, in large part thanks to Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney taking on some big characters. But the movie also takes the course a lot of true-story movies do, where they worry more about telling you what happened than they do about building characters.,I think this works to a point. It’s a wild story, and they do an entertaining job telling it. But I wish the film pushed a little further into who these people are. Showing the crime only as it’s unraveled is a cool way to tell the story, but it also means we don’t get to learn much about what anyone is doing until it’s a bit too late.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Almost a decade after leaving ,, Steve Carell has a new sitcom. While , is a workplace comedy, and Carell is once again playing a boss, he’s taking on a very different role than Michael Scott. In ,, he seems to be the one everyone else is playing off, and there’s a great cast around him. It looks like it’s off to a funny start. The show debuts May 29th.,It’s been a while since we got a new Judd Apatow comedy. His first feature since , five years ago stars Pete Davidson as a slacker still living at home, who suddenly has to start being responsible for some young kids. Universal’s trailer for the film paints it as weirdly uplifting... which I have to imagine is not the primary tone of the movie? It heads on demand on June 12th., is being pitched as the documentary counterpart to Michelle Obama’s blockbuster memoir. It’s hard to imagine fans won’t find something to enjoy here, though , the documentary is less revealing than the book. The film hit Netflix earlier this week.,HBO has a documentary adaptation of Michelle McNamara’s investigation into the Golden State Killer, and like the book, it seems to pull in McNamara’s obsession around finding the culprit in a big way. The documentary comes to HBO on June 28th.,Hearing your friends’ stories about being high and laughing at dumb stuff is never as funny as they imagine it’s going to be. But... it might be a little different when it’s famous people telling you stories about being high, and that seems to be what , is all about. The film comes to Netflix on May 11th.,It’s ,, but with flowers — and that seems like a pretty good recipe.

Rick and Morty’s Chris Parnell thinks Jerry would do very well in quarantine,"
          May 11, 2020,  9:30am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Chris Parnell is a normcore comedy assassin. After a career in improv,  two stints on ,, and countless roles on sitcoms like , and animated shows like ,, Parnell has perfected the art of using his extremely average appearance — and voice — to deliver disarmingly strange, ridiculous and deadpan comedy. Few are better at making the act of looking like a relatively normal dude and keeping a straight face so , (,).,This is why, as Jerry Smith, Parnell is an essential part of what makes , work. His ability to adopt an aw-shucks affectation even as he bears witness to some of the most bizarre things committed to animation makes him one of the most endearing aspects of the show.,Recently, Parnell spoke with,in a phone call from Los Angeles, where the actor is currently self-quarantined with his family, for a conversation about Jerry’s quarantine odds, ,fans, and what he’s up to during isolation. ,This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.,: You know, every time that I do it after it’s been a long break, I have to find it a little bit, but the voice is not that different than my voice and it’s just sort of tapping into Jerry. But the writing is so good, it’s so much of joy on the page and what the writers create so that it’s really just kind of trying to bring that to life. As long as I’m true to that and being present while I’m recording and all that, it’s not too challenging to get back into Jerry.,Pretty much everything that I do is just solo record sessions, which I enjoy. The hardest thing I think is just remembering to really be present and try to act it well and not just kind of say the lines. So there’s a fair bit of visualization going on in my head and trying to sort of put myself in that place and see it. And it’s very freeing in that there’s no camera on me, so it doesn’t matter what I’m doing with my hands and arms and the way I’m gesticulating or whatever, which I do a fair bit of when I record voiceover. So you’re really just taking all of this energy and funneling it through your voice without being able to see anything which you’re doing physically. Although, obviously, what I do physically with my face and my body is going to affect how my voice sounds.,But yeah, I mean, I feel lucky that I get to do both things. Both the live action and the animated stuff. Obviously, these days it tends to be mostly the animation, but I get to do enough guest star appearances on sitcoms or the occasional movie part or things like that. I get to have that one-on-one interaction with other actors actually with us looking at each other and saying things to each other, so that’s very nice to get to do both.,Would I? Sure. I mean, I probably have at some level. I mean, I’ve certainly done a lot of characters that are ,.,I don’t think so, honestly. Not to be Mr. Tough Guy, but when you’ve had a background doing The Groundlings like I have and once you do live improv shows and stuff like that, there’s really... almost anything goes. And then ,. I mean, people who have been a part of comedy for an extended period of time, as I’ve been fortunate enough to be, for the vast majority of us anyway, there’s not really much that shocks us. Part of doing comedy is doing things that are shocking and surprising and ridiculous, so I don’t know I’ve ever actually encountered anything with Jerry that I was like, “Oh boy. Wow.”,I don’t interact with fans a lot mainly because I’m not on social media, and the only real time for that interaction is at the occasional convention, like Comic-Con or whatever that Adult Swim will send us to. And that’s awesome and that’s really fun and that’s a great time to get to see the crowd react to the screening of an episode or in doing a panel and hearing their questions, so it becomes tangible in a way that it’s not usually. ,But I actually find it freeing to not have to try to do something for an immediate audience reaction and just sort of hope that what I’m doing is funny or whatever it’s supposed to be. And once it’s all put together and animated — obviously, the animation is a big part of it — that people will react in a good way and laugh at [Jerry]. I don’t mind not having that immediate reaction, in a strange way.,I don’t, really. I mean, occasionally I’ll hear that somebody is being nasty or misogynistic or something, but I don’t... other than the broad colors like that. I know that’s very much the minority, but yeah, I don’t have a huge sense of what it’s like.,Yeah? I believe that. ,Well, Rick is fairly amoral. He makes a lot of questionable or outright terrible choices, so I guess there’s going to be people that relate to that in a very particular way and sort of revel in that. ,Any time people get really excited and, dare I say, rabid about something, there’s probably going to be some nastiness involved — and also just inherent in, obviously, social media and people communicating without having to be looking at somebody face to face. Then maybe just the nihilistic nature of , and the darkness of it sort of brings something extra out of some of the fans.,My sons are six and three, so they don’t watch ,, even though they do have some of the plushies and little hard plastic figurines. I mean, my six-year-old knows who Mr. Poopy Butthole is, you know? Other than watching the show with my wife and the bit of feedback I get from her, but we don’t really take the show apart or anything. I’m not sure if my sister watches it. My parents definitely don’t. ,Well, I think Jerry would actually do pretty well with it. I think he would just find some little projects to engage himself with and focus on those and feel proud of his little victories he might have. I know he’s going to be taking up, on some level, beekeeping in these upcoming episodes. So yeah, I don’t think it would be too rough on Jerry. ,Well, I’m on the fourth book of the , series by Dan Simmons. I don’t know if you know that at all, but it’s a great, great science fiction series. I mean, just extraordinary. So I’m making my way through the fourth and last book of that series, and then my wife and I, we have to find shows that we both want to watch at night after the kids are in bed. We love John Oliver, like so many people do. We love Bill Maher and Samantha Bee, we’re fans of hers, and we also watch ,and ,. My wife turned me on to those shows back many years ago, and so, although I never thought I’d be watching reality TV, I do. I am now invested slightly in the lives of those women.,Yeah. Yeah. A lot of it I cannot watch. Like, I have no interest in , or certain shows where I just feel like people are not particularly interesting, but yeah. And then lately my wife’s been having these sort of meetups with some of the other ladies in our neighborhood where they’ll just sit out on the street in lawn chairs and keep their distance, their social distance, and chat. But I’m still catching up with this show,,.,Right? I’ve still got a couple more episodes of, what, season 3, I guess? But yeah, that’s a little treat."
HBO is teaming up with Scener to give subscribers the ability to watch TV together,"
          May 14, 2020,  9:00am EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"People stuck in quarantine who might want to watch ,or ,with friends and family have the option to do so using Scener. ,, an online video chatting tool that allows people to sign in to their Netflix accounts to watch movies and TV shows with friends who also subscribe to the services, is adding HBO to people’s viewing options. Anyone with an HBO Now or HBO Go subscription in the United States can boot up the streaming service, create a private virtual theater for up to 20 people, and watch any title. Scener marks the first major partnership between WarnerMedia’s HBO network and an online co-viewing platform. ,Joe Braidwood, Scener’s co-founder, knew that finding an easy way to give people the ability to stream and hang out with their friends online that also worked within the fragile copyright rules crucial to studios and streamers was important. Braidwood just “didn’t predict it would be a pandemic that makes it mainstream,” he told ,“When the pandemic hit, we saw a crazy surge in demand for our product,” Braidwood added. ,It wasn’t long after that various shelter-in-place orders went into effect around the United States. As more people stayed home, WarnerMedia reached out to Scener about a partnership. Scener and WarnerMedia started working together in March. The new partnership accompanies a new design for the site, including a recent update that helps to  ease the stress on Google Chrome browsers running the app.,“We used to overlay the video and social channels, which injected a lot of code at once leading to a lot of stability issues in Netflix,” Braidwood said. “People were running out of memory because so much was happening on one Chrome tab.”,Since the update’s rolled out, Scener’s received a wave of positive feedback. Something it was hopeful for as usage started skyrocketing was seeing active usage increase 15 times on the legacy product, he said. Having HBO on board was added pressure. Co-watching isn’t a new concept, but “the approach that we take is a very safe and compatible with HBO’s vision,” Braidwood said. HBO, a network that deals with its most popular shows winding up on piracy sites hours after episodes air, wants to ensure that subscribers have the opportunity to watch shows with their friends they can’t see, but not at a cost to their network. ,Piracy is, of course, an issue that Hollywood studios and networks think about, but so does Braidwood. Sites like Twitch often play host to pirated content being streamed by individual users. It’s how some ,, one of HBO’s most successful series. Twitch works to take them down, but on Sunday nights when ,was airing, there seemed to be a new stream for every one removed. ,Part of the appeal of watching a show or movie on Twitch and over Discord is socialization through chat. Braidwood thinks of the current moment like the music industry. Napster became a problem the industry was forced to figure out, and part of the solution came in the form of Spotify. ,“It wasn’t until Spotify’s delightful UX and revenue split that the industry started to move past that problem,” Braidwood said. “Yes, people download and pirate movies, and streaming them on Discord and Twitch, but the majority of people don’t have the time or the patience for that. They want a delightful, easy experience.” ,Scener isn’t the only company trying to get ahead of the co-viewing trend. Amazon, which owns Twitch, is letting streamers , that are available on ,, the company’s streaming service. Everyone who wants in on the party has to subscribe to Amazon Prime, similar to how people who use Scener have subscriptions to Netflix, HBO Now, or HBO Go. Studios and streaming platforms are looking at co-viewing now more than ever because the pandemic has created an increase in demand, but Braidwood doesn’t think co-viewing will only stick around while people are at home. ,“There are watershed moments in history where black swan events change human behavior; that couldn’t be more true for America right now,” Braidwood said. “This is one of the first milestones that starts tracking the new path of co-viewing becoming more than just a trend. We think the sky’s the limit.”"
Netflix’s The Eddy is a can’t-miss trip to Paris — with one bad detour,"
          May 14, 2020,  3:42pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"The most upsetting thing about ,is that it’s already over. Netflix’s latest bingeable show is a limited series, an eight-episode run about a jazz club in Paris. Produced by Academy Award-winning ,and ,director Damien Chazelle (who directed the first two episodes) and written by acclaimed playwright Jack Thorne, ,y feels like it brings something truly new to the , original series the streaming giant has cultivated of late, and it’s one of the most visually rewarding shows in your queue this year. ,The series follows Elliot (André Holland, terrific) as he struggles to keep his jazz club, The Eddy, afloat during a particularly bad time. His house band is on the verge of getting signed, but bad luck keeps getting in the way. His daughter, Julie (Amandla Stenberg), is now living with him after a bad time with her mother in the States, and she’s acting out. There’s a famous producer interested in his band, but he’s flighty, and the band needs some work. And then his partner, Farid (Tahar Rahim), is murdered.,That last bit is easily the worst thing about ,. The show follows this murder plot through its entirety, grafting a half-baked crime drama onto a superb European hangout. Everything that the series might need from a shocking death — an avenue to explore grief and fuel for character implosions — could conceivably be achieved by replacing Farid’s murder with any other sort of unexpected death. That it chooses to commit so fully to this plotline is baffling, with many scenes of cops and heavies and menacing phone calls just rudely making a mess of what’s otherwise extremely good. ,Sometimes, when writing about TV, you have to be careful to avoid criticizing a series for not being what you want it to be, instead of what it is. , sincerely seems like it wants to be a meandering tale that’s mostly about nothing, just hardscrabble music lovers feeling things and making self-destructive choices on a small scale. Why spend an episode on the bassist who suffers through a day as the third wheel between his former love and her new beau? Or another on a singer’s struggle with her self-worth, caught between two men who want to use her talents to advance their careers and a mother who has never even heard the word “boundaries” in her life? Why film Paris so unromantically, with a wonderful, lived-in feeling, with characters that flow from English to French to Arabic? Why work so hard to marry these tiny dramas to such fantastic music? ,And yes, in keeping with Damien Chazelle projects like ,and ,, , is incredibly good at visually conveying what it feels like to perform music: to be in it and making it at once. In directing the first two episodes, Chazelle sets a standard for this that isn’t ,consistently met throughout — you will notice later episodes dial back his frenetic energy a bit — but they all understand what music , to these characters and work hard to make sure you do, too. ,Above all else, , is a show to be experienced. It’s a shame that its gritty crime plot feels like it comes from a different show entirely — one that wants to shock and pull you from one episode to the next, instead of trusting you will simply flow there with the current.

Co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg attributes “everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus,” he told , , published on Monday. But Katzenberg is hopeful that rolling out new features will help, including giving subscribers the ability to share content from Quibi shows on social media. ,When Quibi launched at the beginning of April, the app blocked sharing to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit.

The Snowpiercer TV show slows down a thrilling train ride,"
          May 18, 2020,  1:58pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,", Bong Joon-ho’s gripping sci-fi film, doesn’t seem like a natural fit for television. A tense post-apocalyptic story where the remnants of humanity succumb to class warfare on an endlessly running train, the movie was a finely tuned thriller that also succinctly articulated its themes. More of something isn’t always a good thing. You run the risk of diluting it, especially when the leaner medium of TV forces you to reproduce the original on a tighter budget. There are good ways to do this, but TNT’s , series has found probably the most mundane way to pull it off. ,Ironically, the first change in ,’s TV adaptation, despite being a television cliché, is a really good one: making its protagonist a detective. The broad strokes are otherwise mostly the same as the 2014 film. When our climate crisis reaches an untenable state, scientists inadvertently create another one, making the planet inhospitably cold. In order to save humanity, a 1,001-car supertrain is built to endlessly circumnavigate the globe, a place for the human race to ride out the apocalypse — provided they can buy a ticket. Those who do are stratified by wealth, with the rich in luxe cars up front and the poor stowaways who forced their way aboard penned in the back, living in squalor. ,Layton (Daveed Diggs) is one of those “tailies,” eking out a miserable existence as his cohorts plan a revolution. Things are complicated, however, when Layton is recruited by the people in charge because he is the only passenger who was a former homicide detective, and there is a murder that needs solving — one that slowly, over the show’s first season, causes the fraught balance of the Snowpiercer population to fall apart. ,Shifting the story’s perspective to a detective is a smart way to make ,interesting over 10 hour-long episodes. , quickly shows why: Layton’s recruitment allows him to introduce viewers to the world as it’s been re-created aboard the eponymous train, drifting from car to car as the story requires. Check it out: there’s a nightclub car, a twisted morgue where troublesome individuals are put in suspended animation and stashed in drawers, a school car, suites for the first class, okay rooms for fourth class, and so on. ,This is where dilution starts to be a bit of a problem. , wasn’t a terribly subtle film, turning the evils of capitalism into a speeding freight train that hurtles at the viewer, but every way it expounded on its sci-fi future felt vital. As a TV show, , has to be about more things and show the audience more of the world in order to build a longer, serial story. Unfortunately, that longer story is a drag. ,There’s some really good stuff. The third episode, in particular, “Access Is Power,” delves into the train’s circular, closed economy and the way nothing is ever wasted as passengers from front to tail barter everything imaginable in order to get a peek at life above their station. But the majority of ,feels perfunctory. It’s a competent show that’s efficiently made and is steadily working toward its big season-ending goal of revolution, just like the movie. But lacking the urgency of a shorter runtime, it’s not an engrossing experience, just a nice idle one. ,Watching ,, I found myself wishing it was , of a detective show. Something more strictly episodic, with Layton being asked to investigate a different case every week, would give the show’s writers and directors enough to make the show different every episode. Unfortunately, like every passenger on ,, once you’re on this particular train, you’ve got no choice but to barrel ahead toward the same destination as everyone else. The only difference here is you can get off if you want. "

"Avatar: The Last Airbender is back on Netflix, but don’t start with the first episode","
          May 21, 2020,  3:41pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera," is back on Netflix after a seven-year absence, and if you never caught the show, now is a perfect time. ,isn’t just one of the best animated series around; it’s full-stop excellent television regardless of format. This might not be clear from episode 1, though. As premieres go, it’s charming but geared toward hooking children. Skepticism is okay! Just don’t pass it by without diving into one of its best episodes, “Zuko Alone” (season 2, episode 7). It’s a standalone tale that explains everything you need to know — a terrific martial arts Western with surprisingly rich characterization and a gut-punch ending — all in 20 minutes. ,In ,there are four nations, each based on the mastery of a different element: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air. The Fire Nation declared war on the others, and the series is about children caught up in this war. Most episodes focus on Aang, the titular Avatar, the only person in the world with the ability to master all four elements and prophesied to restore balance. The only problem: he’s a child and not quite in command of every element yet. Through a mix of standalone and serial episodes, , follows Aang and his young friends as they help him on his journey to master the elements, while pursued by Fire Nation and stymied by adults in power.,“Zuko Alone” focuses on the young Prince Zuko, one of the show’s primary antagonists, exiled from the Fire Nation after a humiliating failure, left to wander on his own. The episode is removed from the show’s highly serialized plot. Like in a good Western, Zuko takes on the archetypal role of The Man With No Name. He arrives at a small frontier town for rest and a meal when he encounters a conflict: crooked Earth Kingdom soldiers are terrorizing the villagers they’re supposed to protect. As a once-proud member of the invading nation, Zuko has been a villain unaccustomed to caring about others. In exile however, his priorities are slowly shifting, and he decides to intervene. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the plot of ,, one of the most beloved and regularly homaged Westerns.) ,In “Zuko Alone,” the former prince finally gets a chance to see what he’s represented all this time to the people outside of the Fire Nation. His internal conflict is externalized by his decision to hide his identity, and the unspoken idea that his new friends might not respond so kindly if they knew who he was. ,One reason , is loved by its fans is the way it refuses to talk down to its audience. Like Phillip Pullman’s YA trilogy ,, it’s a show that rarely simplifies things to “good” or “evil,” letting its protagonists be selfish and wrong at times and giving its antagonists depth whenever possible. In the world of ,, characters are caught between compassion and conflict, and war provides them with regular opportunity to behave nobly or selfishly. That its main characters are all children only underlines all of this. The frequent goofy hijinks and moments of weakness are all normal parts of growing up, and no matter how much we’d like it to be, growing up does not happen in a vacuum. It happens out in the world where there is conflict, war, and pain. The children of , want to be kids, but they’re also inheriting the world of their parents and are just starting to see it for what it is — but they’re not yet jaded enough to stop seeing what it could be. ,This is what makes “Zuko Alone” a good introduction to ,: it’s a small character study of one of these kids, scarred in more ways than one, coming to terms with all manner of consequence — the cost of his decisions, the burden of his place in the world, the limits of his control over how others perceive him, and the potential he still has to become who he wants to be, under his old name or not. ,That’s pretty good stuff for a kid’s show. , "
Stargirl doesn’t know what to do with its superhero nostalgia,"
          May 22, 2020, 12:36pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Here’s something that can be easy to forget about comic book superheroes, given how popular they’ve become over the last decade: they’re really quite old. This is especially true for DC Comics characters like Batman and Superman, who were created in the 1930s. Comic books were extremely different then, and many superheroes of the Golden Age were specific to their era in ways that don’t necessarily translate to modern success outside of the odd period piece. , is a modern love letter to those old superheroes, but it never really sells you on , you should love them., — which you can watch Mondays on DC Universe or a slightly edited for broadcasting on the CW on Tuesdays — begins 10 years before the present day in the middle of the final battle between the Justice Society of America and the Injustice Society. The good guys (guess which ones those are) lose — badly. In his final act, the superhero Starman (Joel McHale, of all people) gives his sidekick Pat “Stripey” Dugan (Luke Wilson) the source of his power, the Cosmic Staff, telling him someday, someone worthy of it should get it — just not Stripey. ,Ten years later, that person turns out to be Courtney Whitmore (Brec Bassinger), Dugan’s new stepdaughter. Courtney’s life is about to get a big shakeup as she and her mother, Barbara (Amy Smart), are about to move Blue Valley, Nebraska, with Pat and his terrible son Mike (Trae Romano). Shortly after the move, Courtney finds Pat’s collection of Justice Society memorabilia along with the Cosmic Staff, which appears to have a mind of its own and seems to choose Courtney as Starman’s replacement. ,Unfortunately for her, the former members of the Injustice Society are still around and would very much like Starman to have , replacement. And so the stage is set: Courtney becomes Stargirl, Pat becomes her backup / mentor, and the former Injustice Society members are the villains. ,Much of ,is devoted to nostalgia. Blue Valley is the very picture of good fashioned Americana: a bustling Main Street, a homey-looking suburb, and a general pleasantness that keeps Pat Dugan’s aw-shucks demeanor, ‘50s roadster, and teal icebox-style fridge from feeling out of place. While the local high school is sufficiently diverse, Blue Valley is a town that appears untouched by said diversity, the lily-white Dugan / Whitmore household the town’s unspoken standard. ,There’s also more overt nostalgia in the way that , is secretly about bringing back the Justice Society of America, a set of DC superheroes that embody the old-school heroics of a simpler world. Throughout the first three episodes made available to critics, , slowly starts to suggest that there , be a point to all of this: Blue Valley’s wholesome Americana might be exploited by the civilian alter-egos of the Injustice Society, as a plan to restore the town seems to have a secret sinister motivation. There’s also the fact that Courtney / Stargirl is rebuilding the JSA with a new generation of recruits, which hints that the show might display some interest in the disparity between Blue Valley as idealized by the previous generation and Blue Valley as it exists. But I won’t hold my breath. ,Mostly, , is just aiming to be a pleasant show about a young girl trying to fit into a small town and fight against expressly evil men who want to rid the world of heroes. It’s saccharine and more than a little corny, but it’s also hollow. Superheroes are metaphors,  as big and obvious as some of them can be like, say, Captain America. And that’s the entire point: a simple mantra or belief to rally behind, something decent or true to embody in the middle of a messy world. If , has that heart, it’s taking its sweet time to show it.

Little Fires Everywhere wants you to know it’s definitely about race,"

You know the kind of people who describe themselves as “comfortable?” , is a show about that very specific demographic, and what happens when their carefully constructed world starts to tear at the seams. People are challenged with the notion that maybe they aren’t as progressive and open-minded as they think they are. ,Hulu’s adaptation of Celeste Ng’s excellent novel is set in Shaker Heights, a real-life suburb of Cleveland. Taking place in the ‘90s, the story follows the well-to-do Richardson family, outlining the events that would lead to their house being burned down by their youngest daughter, Izzy (Megan Stott) — the event that kicks off the show. The eight episodes (the first three are out now, the rest weekly) that follow illustrate how the Richardsons got here, starting with the arrival of Mia Warren (Kerry Washington) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood), two people who get hopelessly tangled in the Richardsons’ lives, inadvertently exposing their worst traits. ,Mia, an artist, leads an itinerant life and has arrived in Shaker Heights with the hopes of giving Pearl a stability they’ve never had together. She leases an apartment from the Richardsons, and over time, she and Pearl slowly become more integrated in their daily life. Pearl attends the same school as the four Richardson children, befriending middle son Moody (Gavin Lewis) and pining after his older brother Trip (Jordan Elsass). Meanwhile, misfit Izzy begins to strike up a relationship with Mia, as Mia and Elena Richardson, the family matriarch, become increasingly wary of the influence each has on the other’s children. ,From here, , slowly starts to simmer, putting each of its cast of privileged white characters in situations that gradually escalate until they are forced to finally ditch their preferred euphemisms. Each encounter exposes another way in which they believe themselves to be good and decent because they’ve built a world where their sense of selves are not challenged. Elena’s daughter Lexie thinks herself virtuous for dating a black classmate, Brian, although she swears it doesn’t enter the equation. Elena hires Mia as her housekeeper, willfully ignorant of the race and class dynamics at play by hiring someone who pays her rent. Bill Richardson (Joshua Jackson), Elena’s husband, admonishes her for not getting a background check before offering the apartment to Mia. Elena, repeatedly, compliments herself for what a , she’s doing by helping the Warrens. ,Over and over again, the Warrens collide against the polite racism of those who pride themselves as not racist, and those small collisions slowly build to something catastrophic, as a friend of the Richardsons adopts a Chinese baby whose mother suddenly resurfaces, demanding her child back. It’s a crisis that compels the people in it to directly say what they’ve spent their lives talking around, and the results are not pretty.,While , has its sights set squarely on being a withering takedown of petty suburban class dynamics, it’s also remarkably understanding of the people within it. While its heart lies with the Warrens, every major player is considerably complicated. Elena Richardson is perfectly played by Reese Witherspoon — every passive-aggressive action cheerily delivered, and every boundary violation couched in the language of good intentions. As deft as the characterization is, the series is also interested in the forces that produce it — how a woman’s ambitions are stifled by societal pressures, and how she ultimately can end up reinforcing the boundaries that initially penned her in. ,That depth extends in every direction — Mia, as played by Kerry Washington, is a quiet force of nature, slowly realizing that she has just enough leverage to upend the neatly ordered worlds of the people who don’t know how much power they indiscriminately wield. As her past becomes less of a mystery, viewers begin to understand why she would apply that pressure. Through Pearl, Mia’s heartbreak is felt when the fault lines that she sees are clearly exposed for the first time. Through each of the Richardson children, the costs of perpetuating the life their parents made for them begin to manifest in unexpected ways. ,This is what , most clearly conveys: there are no easy answers, but there are people who benefit from the questions that go unasked. And when things get hard, there will always be people who have the option to make good choices and those who do not. Most times, the world counts on these questions going unasked, under the guise of manners.

Tiger King is a show about how the internet eats us all,"
          Apr  1, 2020,  1:15pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera," is one of the strongest contenders for most watchable TV show of the year, and it’s a problem. A documentary miniseries comprising seven quick episodes, each under an hour, you could watch the whole thing in a weekend; given the subject, you’ll probably finish even faster. ,The Netflix series follows a man both larger than life and smothered by it: Joe Exotic, the one-time owner of a successful-seeming private zoo with over 200 tigers and other big cats. He’s a man who ran for president of the United States, then governor of Oklahoma, and then sometime after, may have tried to hire someone to kill his nemesis, a woman dedicated to shutting his zoo down. It’s incredibly compelling, and terribly so: ,is almost wholly dedicated to spectacle, with little interest in any sense of truth. And the truth is about as gutting as , is sensational.,As the eponymous Tiger King, Joe Exotic is magnetic: a ball-capped, mulleted man who swaggers with a knee brace and a drawl, wearing some combination of fringe vests, chaps, and bedazzled shirts at all times. You’ve never seen anyone on television like him. Born Joe Schreibvogel, the man’s eccentricities are accompanied by a tragic backstory that ,will deliver piecemeal and in passing. For the first few episodes, we meet him more or less fully formed: a man who has built a small empire with his larger-than-life personality and his equally large cats — an empire that, somehow, crumbled and landed him in prison. ,Every minute of , yields some new surprise, an unbelievable turn or charismatic stranger with incredible stories to tell. The documentary plays fast and loose with these anecdotes, as Joe Exotic shows us how he married two men at once, went into business with a guy who snuck tiger cubs into Vegas casinos, or nearly got mauled by one of his own lions. With no warning, the show also veers into immensely dark territory, as its subjects recount manipulative and abusive relationships, a death by suicide, and Joe Exotic’s sustained hate campaign against Carole Baskin, an activist committed to ending big cat ownership in America whom Joe Exotic also believes killed her wealthy husband for money.,As , goes on, its greatest strength — the litany of unbelievable stories it has to share — becomes its most concerning weakness, as the filmmakers don’t really seem to be interested in telling a story about its subjects as they are in milking them dry. There’s little point to , beyond its sensational thrills and credulously presenting everyone it puts in front of a camera. The show does not, for example, present any context for how seriously you should take the allegation that Carole Baskin killed her husband — so now this allegation is fodder for viral tweets, , for the , , that happens to have real-world fallout: new leads in case of Baskin’s missing ex-husband are being ,. ,It’s likely that you will watch , and wonder if there’s more to the story, and you’d be right. A cursory search for facts will likely lead to , feature about the tangled histories of Schreibvogel and Baskin, reconstructing their early lives and detailing their rivalry. Laid out in print, the story is far more sobering than the occasional flashes of somber distress we get on the show. Both Schreibvogel and Baskin are reportedly victims of abuse, dogged by misfortune and embraced by strange circumstances. Truth is elusive in both of their lives; Schreibvogel appears to be a serial fabulist, and Baskin’s public persona has a singular focus, with few public associations beyond the cats she keeps on her preserve. In their orbits, lives are destroyed — the overwhelming number of them sacrifices dedicated to the myth of the Tiger King.,There’s a level of complicity to viral fame that’s hard to square with shows like ,. In the streaming era, interest is often the result of direct action. There’s very little passivity left in how we entertain ourselves. We choose what to watch, what to recommend, and who to listen to, so if something like , is a viral hit, it , organic, like something we’re all talking about because we’re genuinely interested in it. ,Because of this, , becomes content that generates , content on websites and social media, which, in turn, leads more people back to ,. This, then, eventually leads to the extremely online becoming amateur sleuths and flooding Florida tip lines about a decades-old murder case. Through this cycle, suffering becomes sport — something that can be said of a lot of true-crime media — but also a call to action. ,It can be seen in the way the , encourages listeners to adopt a vindictive view of the role of law enforcement or in the entire cottage industry spun out of ,’s first season, which birthed an entertainment empire around the guilt or innocence of Adnan Syed. It’s a phenomenon fueled by our need to seek resolution where there often is none to be found. In the absence of finality, we post into the infinite. The tyranny of the internet bleeds into the real world: if there’s enough content, eventually, that content becomes real life. We are consumed by the tiger king. "

I think I complained in one of these columns recently that, upon rewatching ,y, I felt like its animation was underused, barely scratching the surface of what such a dark, trippy film could do with that dreamy style. , gets it right.,The series does a wonderful job of using its dreamy look to tell a story where characters are constantly going in and out of memories, leaving moments behind only to return to them later, mid-conversation. It’s something that could easily be overdone, but the story keeps it all grounded, even as the visuals help to express just how disorienting and occasionally wonderful the feeling of slipping in and out of time can be.,And ultimately, the show’s characters are just so strong and colorful on their own that it’d be worth watching even if people weren’t constantly slipping through time and space. The rotoscoped style could have distanced us, but instead it gives the actors space to be even more expressive, as the scene focuses us on their eyes, mouth, or hands, making simple motions feel large and impactful.,Check out seven trailers from this week below.,J.J.

"Amazon Prime Video now allows in-app rentals and purchases on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV","

        ",Nick Statt,"Amazon’s Prime Video iOS and Apple TV apps now let customers make in-app purchases, including renting and buying films and TV shows. The change marks a huge shift in Amazon’s approach to the App Store, which mandates a 30 percent cut on all in-app purchases. ,Prior to the change, Amazon would not allow you to rent or buy content on the Prime Video app, instead, directing users to a web browser to avoid the App Store fee. You could still sign up for a Prime Video subscription through the iOS app if you are not an Amazon Prime subscriber, but even then, you could not make individual content purchases from within the app. ,Now, when users log in to the Prime Video app, there should be a message reading, “Browse, rent, or buy new release movies, popular TV shows, and more — now within the app.” (Big thanks to George Watson, who tipped us off to this change.) ,The prices do not appear to have been raised to account for the 30 percent fee, as ,. It was not immediately clear whether Amazon reached a deal with Apple or whether it is indeed deciding to pay the full cut. But Apple has since confirmed that it entered Amazon Prime Video into an established program for “premium” video providers. ,“Apple has an established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers to offer a variety of customer benefits — including integration with the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on,” Apple said in a statement given to ,. “On qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Atlice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.” ,Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ,In the new Prime Video app, which does not require an update, there’s now a full-blown store tab at the bottom. It features lists of popular and new movies to buy or rent, including many of the recently released films like ,and , that were in theaters in February and March but ,. ,According to user reports and Apple’s statement, Amazon is processing purchases using its own stored payment methods and through its own processor so long as a user has an Amazon account with that information on file. That’s a notable change in how all forms of in-app purchases have been handled before. ,Typically, Apple takes its 30 percent fee and handles all payment, processing, and security upfront — Apple takes only 15 percent from subscriptions so long as a customers signed up for the services within the iOS app and has maintained it for more than a year. ,According to app developer Guilherme Rambo, the Prime Video app began using a special request related to payment processing that first suggested an arrangement between Amazon and Apple, prior to Apple confirming the new program.,According to ,’s Mark Gurman, the deal struck between Amazon and Apple is not a wholly unique one; it’s been in place for some time although it is unclear when it was started. The program allows a company to use its own payment methods, Gurman says, and it’s already in use by apps from more niche premium video providers like Altice One and Canal+. ,Gurman, in a , published after the change, later explained that the program also extends to supporting a number of Apple apps, services, and features — including the “Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on,” according to Apple’s statement.,Regardless of how long this program has existed and the exact terms of the deal that was struck between the two companies, the change should remove a long-lasting headache to buying and renting movies and shows through Amazon’s app and on Apple TV. ,Bloomberg"
"Quibi’s shows are fun, familiar, and a little forgettable","
          Apr  6, 2020,  8:42am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"It’s far too easy to make fun of Quibi. That’s the first problem. You can start with the name: an overly cute mashup of “quick bites.” It’s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to — hence a bizarre , dedicated to explaining it. It’s Netflix, but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt, yet brief enough that you wouldn’t turn to anything but your phone. You know: waiting in lines, pausing to sip a coffee, sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something. That’s Quibi’s second problem: it was created for a world that doesn’t really exist anymore, one put on hold by a pandemic. ,This makes Quibi a harder sell. TV to watch while you’re doing something else doesn’t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on. However, the contrary can , be true: we’re all staring at our phones anyway, so what’s another reason to do it some more? As of today, there are 24 reasons, each Quibi show delivered in installments of 10 minutes or less, each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream. There are 72 snacks in search of a meal.,The content — normally a crass word for art but an apt one for Quibi — runs the gamut, with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven’t really seen before. There’s a , revival starring Chance the Rapper, a series called , where Offset is really into cars and car stunts, a remake of ,starring Liam Hemsworth, and ,, a truly bizarre show where Will Arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the YouTube clip yourself. ,(,The Verg,Polygon,Verge,.),Quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone; almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations. I checked this, incessantly, with every show I watched. There’s something mind-boggling about it, the way Quibi tries to have things literally both ways. It works well enough, but there are strange side effects. In scripted shows, the dual-composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time, and that can make a serious drama feel shallow. In unscripted shows, this adds a layer of uncanniness, as slick network production clashes with a visual composition that’s thoroughly associated with influencers and lo-fi meme makers. You can, ironically, gauge how good a Quibi show is by how well it plays in vertical orientation. ,The majority of Quibi’s programming is the sort of stuff you can find on regular TV, just broken up into smaller pieces. , is a reality show in the vein of , in seven-minute chunks. , , feels like a USA drama, delivered one plot development at a time. , actually , a TV show long before Quibi, but someone figured it might play better if you didn’t have to spend 30 minutes with it. (They were right.) ,Quibi’s best shows are the ones that feel most like they could only happen on Quibi. There’s not a lot of that in the launch lineup, but perhaps the best example is ,, a ,-style courtroom show in which Chrissy Teigen is a courtroom judge mediating exclusively petty disputes, like who got someone a better Lizzo-themed sweater. It’s the perfect Quibi show — like a TikTok that got a little out of hand, but it ends just before it stops being funny. ,Another, ,, features comedians Matt Rogers and Dave Mizzoni as hosts in a competition. In every episode, two different straight men will compete to see who is the better queer ally. Again, it’s a bit that’s perfectly pitched for the platform. It’s savvy and effective, with stunts loud enough to hold your attention and talent deft enough to keep it. (It also might be the most genuinely funny show on Quibi so far.),Documentaries also fare pretty well on Quibi. The standout is ,, about LeBron James’ I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, which serves at-risk children with an approach that’s equal parts social work and education. Compelling, frank, and moving, each eight-minute installment absolutely flies by. ,Still, there’s a frivolousness to Quibi that none of its programming can seem to shake because the platform was built for frivolity. I could put on a Quibi show and keep up with it just fine while writing a grocery list, chopping garlic, or brushing my teeth and only glancing at it. Once, I almost put on a Quibi show while watching something else on my TV. ,For this reason, Quibi’s best point of comparison is podcasts, not streaming TV. It’s a medium for filling space that you probably already had filled with something else, but for some reason, you got it in your head that you should be , something in that time. It exists in a nebulous space between the steady dopamine rush of TikTok’s constant supply of novelty and the chill, lackadaisical time-sink of Twitch. Boredom is the constant, and it’s most often resolved by habit. This then, is the platform’s biggest ask: can you change your habits to accommodate it?,Because Quibi is designed to be habitual. New episodes are scheduled to drop every day, and new shows will premiere “every single Monday,” per Quibi. It’s a steady stream of quick bites coming from an endless bag of treats. Even in a world shut down by circumstance, Quibi is an interesting idea, one that wants us to use our phones the way we already do, like fidget spinners with Wi-Fi or a smoke break we can take anywhere. But that’s the third problem: no one remembers a snack. They remember a really good dinner. "
Tales from the Loop turns small-town America into a sci-fi feelings machine,"
          Apr  6, 2020, 10:50am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"is so pretty it breaks your heart. Based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, famous for his scenes of pastoral tranquility draped around uncanny sci-fi sights, ,’s newest drama is a collection of eight short stories where everyday rural life is tinged with the supernatural. But unlike, say, ,, where the otherworldly takes center stage, , uses it as an excuse to dig deeper into the people who must continue to live mundane lives, even as the extraordinary looms just inches away. ,While , features a recurring cast of characters and overlapping plots, each episode functions as a standalone short story. Since critics were sent three out-of-order episodes for review, it’s safe to assume that continuity isn’t really a concern for the show; just consider it , with every episode set in the same town. ,And what a town it is! The series takes place in a fictional Ohio neighborhood built above The Loop, a machine built to “explore the mysteries of the universe.” The Loop is massive, and, while it employs most of the residents who live above it, few know the full extent of what goes on within its confines. All they know is that the work done there has changed the texture of their lives. Some of these changes are overt and intentional, like advances in technology that make robotic limbs, hovering tractors, and walking mechs commonplace. ,Other phenomena are less intentional: strange, inexplicable sightings; objects that appear out of thin air; fluctuations in space and time. In the ecosystem of this small Midwestern town, The Loop is an invasive exotic, reshaping the balance of life and nature around it. And everyone there has to just roll with it because they have no choice. Besides, sometimes The Loop has its benefits. ,In the episodes provided in advance, a girl’s mother disappears and leaves behind a strange artifact in “Loop,” a boy hears voices coming from a strange globe in “Echo Sphere,” and in “Parallel,” a man stumbles into another universe. What follows each is a tender drama that feels like a play, each devoted mostly to loneliness. ,Each character, at least in the episodes screened, yearns for connection. While “Loop” is set in motion by a disappearance, it’s really about distance, as the girl’s search for her missing parent serves as a window into how they became strangers to each other. “Parallel” shows a man meeting himself in another universe, but it chooses character drama over genre thrills as the two versions of the same man attempt to befriend one another. Over and over, , gestures at some inarticulate sadness and shows its characters trying to work through it. ,It’s not that big of a stretch from Stålenhag’s art, which is overwhelmingly melancholic in the way it juxtaposes the mundane and the fantastic. Transposed from its original Swedish context to an American one, that sorrow takes on new wrinkles. The Loop puts boundless potential literally within arm’s length of small-town Ohio, and yet, its denizens lead more or less the same lives they’d live without it. People still work in what seem like dead-end jobs, they have trouble tilling their fields, they don’t see their families enough. Through the eyes of a set of acclaimed directors — Ti West, Charlie McDowell, So Yong Kim, and Mark Romanek each helm an episode — every moment feels delicate and human, and despair never overwhelms wonder. ,is an understated work in a time when more muted stories are easily swallowed up in the wealth of available options. It’s worth making the time for, though. These are slow stories about how technology was never going to fix us no matter how promising it seems. We still have to go the slow route and try to fill the void in ourselves by reaching out to others. "

Gags have shifted from pranking your deskmate to creating weird glitch art on Zoom using random anime backgrounds; hijinks in the shared kitchen turned into creating new Slack emoji to deliver a joke faster. ,Even those who aren’t in gig economy jobs are facing a time when physical offices aren’t necessary for most companies. Instant communication tools like Slack make talking with co-workers possible from anywhere, remote work is easy to do with an assortment of productivity services. Michael Scott’s outbursts in ,don’t transition well to Slack, where the equivalent is a message typed out in all-caps. That’s not as funny. ,Videoconferencing has also never been easier. Services like Zoom allow remote workers to talk face-to-face, all from the safety and comfort of their own homes. In December 2019, Zoom saw heights of 10 million daily users — by March 2020, Zoom was hitting “more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid,” ,“We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. ,Companies have transitioned quickly from operating in physical spaces to moving everything online. Zoom is hitting record-breaking numbers, as is Microsoft Teams, a group chat and collaboration tool from Microsoft that rivals Slack. Slack is no different. CEO Stewart Butterfield shared numbers in a lengthy tweet thread, noting that on Tuesday, March 10th, Slack’s concurrent users passed 10 million. That number jumped to 10.5 million just six days later, reaching 12.5 million on March 25th. ,“We have an incredible business that has been growing very quickly and that will continue to do so for many, many years to come,” Butterfield told Slack employees, as seen in ,. “We provide a platform that is going to become even more useful to the world in the years to come.” ,This pandemic will forever change parts of our lives, much like the 1918 influenza did more than 100 years ago. A big part of that will be the physicality of work. “The age of the office as we know it is probably over, and the bell can’t be unrung,” Matt Burr, CEO at Nomadic Learning, ,. More employees, once ready to commute into an office every day, will use tools like Slack and Zoom to work from home more often, according to Burr. Companies will see less of a reason to have physical space and will use remote advantages to build teams in different cities. ,Work has changed, and television will follow. Pop culture has always reflected our lives at a certain moment in time. Similar to how we revisit ,or ,to scratch the nostalgic itch for times when families were corny and homely or marathoning shows like ,and ,to reminisce about a time when people actually hung out, ,yearns for simpler times. Actress Angela Kinsey (who played Angela Martin on the show) described the series as inexplicably comforting. That comfort comes from the normalcy of a work routine — something I’ve come to miss in the weeks I’ve been at home. ,Less than 20 years ago, people worked in offices. Now, many of us work from home. Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein, co-producers on ,, are developing a new workplace comedy, but this one won’t include characters like Dwight and Jim throwing pencils at each other over their computers. Instead, the show is about a “wunderkind boss who, in an effort to ensure his staff’s connectedness and productivity, asks them all to virtually interact and work face-to-face all day,” , ,We’ve walked toward this change in work culture for years, but now it’s here for millions of people. The pandemic didn’t suddenly flip a switch; it proved that people can — and will — work without an office. Last year, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 26 million Americans, or approximately 16 percent of the total workforce, work from home. Imagine if half of ,’s cast suddenly stopped showing up because they could conduct calls at home and check in with co-workers online. Between 2005 and 2015, employees who telecommuted rose by 115 percent, the bureau reported.,Those years also happen to represent ,s run. As ,went off the air, so did the idea that day-to-day work would look the same as it did in 2005. More than 55 million people are gig workers who don’t have offices to go to, more people are set to work from home than ever, and an entire generation of employees may not experience that type of work setting — one considered universal less than 20 years ago. That’s the future pop culture will incorporate. There’s something poetic about ,’s co-producers being some of the first to try. ,“Start with the office comedy, lose the office and you’re just left with comedy,” co-producer Lieberstein told ,. “The math works.” ,In the meantime, many of us are at home, so lonely that we are wistfully streaming old episodes of ,, longing for the Dwight Schrutes in our lives, wishing they could do something annoying enough that we could turn to another colleague for just a moment and roll our eyes."

        ",Joshua Rivera,"One of the benefits of having a TV show on a streaming platform is something few actually take advantage of: you can more or less do anything. Freed from the shackles of broadcast ratings, once a streaming show is greenlit for a season, it’s basically guaranteed that season. ,, a legal drama on CBS All Access, has spent three years playing by no rules other than its own, upending everything you might expect from a legal drama to become one of the most slept-on shows out there. Its season 4 premiere, out this week, is the series at its most absurd and most incisive. ,To understand ,’s audacity, you have to know where it comes from. The first episode of , began with the Trump presidency. The show, a legal drama spun out of , (you don’t really need to watch that to enjoy this one) leaned into this. Its first scene featured protagonist Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a wealthy, successful lawyer, watching the inauguration and swearing. Then, she makes plans: she quits her job and makes preparations to run off to Italy, where she can ignore the looming political carnival. Things don’t go as planned, and she’s stuck here with the rest of us — her money gone, her former firm shutting her out, and her old way of life upended. ,She’s hired by a law firm owned by black partners, and , turns its premise on its head. Instead of being a story about a wealthy white woman dealing with Trump’s America, it’s about her confronting just how different that America is — and always was — for people of color. ,Perhaps that makes the series sound didactic, like it’s serving civic vegetables. And while it’s cathartic to see the writers handle topical issues like ICE’s lack of accountability or the consequences of a record number of barely qualified judges being approved by Congress, , is also unbelievably ,. Like any good courtroom drama, its cases are full of moves and countermoves that make each episode feel like a dance, and it’s frequently laugh-out-loud funny. One of the most memorable characters is Roland Blum (Michael Sheen), and amoral, fentanyl-sucking sleaze who blows through the show’s universe like a dirtbag hurricane that feels too cartoonish to be true. Then you notice he appears in an episode called “The One Inspired by Roy Cohn” and realize that he is, in fact, inspired by Roy Cohn. ,At its best, ,’s jokes always have a little bite. ,Take this season premiere as an example. In a completely out-of-nowhere twist, Diane wakes up to find she is in another universe where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, and she’s the only one who remembers the timeline where Trump did. Again, I must stress that ,is a legal drama. It does , dabble in science fiction or the multiverse or alternate timelines. And yet, that’s what the premiere does because , decided it had to make a point, one that it maybe didn’t underline well enough in previous episodes and one that feels especially resonant in an election year: the problems do not begin and end with the person in the White House. People have blind spots. , excels at satire that is both over-the-top and incredibly sharp — a talent that has made it the first truly good series about the Trump era, even as it continues to unfold. It’s a show that’s not afraid to be ridiculous in an effort to underscore the absurdity of the times, while affixing its drama to underappreciated stories ripped from headlines that the news cycle glosses over all too quickly. The thread tying this season together, for example, involves a top-secret memo that allows the rich to completely opt out of the legal process, a plotline clearly lifted from last year’s long line of Trump associates who simply refused to comply with subpoenas — a criminal offense. ,But perhaps the biggest reason ,resonates is in how it takes advantage of its case-of-the-week structure to continually widen its lens to look at how the systemic corruption of the judicial system is felt by people beyond its world of lawyers, who, by nature of their profession, must continually compromise. Sometimes it falters in this, reflecting the blindspots of the characters it usually is self-aware about. One season gets a little too mired in a #Resist plot, and in another, the , pee tape appears. (Yes, , pee tape. What other one could we possibly be talking about?),Yet, on the whole, , doesn’t want the rich and powerful to be the only ones writing the story of our surreal, nightmarish present. It knows that the justice system is hopelessly compromised, and it isn’t naive enough to think it can be fixed from the inside. The good guys can’t always win, but they can leave a record. "
"Zoom became Saturday Night Live’s breakout star in historic all-digital, remote episode ","
          Apr 12, 2020, 10:32am EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"“Live from Zoom, it’s ,” isn’t a phrase people ever assumed NBC’s quintessential late-night show would ever open with, but then again, most people likely weren’t using ,.,The breakout star of ,’s unprecedented remote episode was the video conferencing tool tens of millions of people are using while working from home. It wasn’t just a casual throwaway line in a sketch during ,’s most recent episode. It wasn’t just a venue where the show was filmed, standing in as a digital replacement for Studio 8H at 30 Rock in New York City. Zoom became a cast member in its own right as the ,team worked remotely to put together a 90-minute show for Saturday night. There was a dedicated Zoom sketch, constant jokes that ended with Zoom punchlines, and an impressive Weekend Update segment all done using the productivity software. ,Like everyone else stuck working from home, the cast of ,was also left to figure out a way to remain productive in an extremely abnormal time. For ,, that means there aren’t any sophisticated props, costumes, or audio and visual effects to carry gags. It’s a group of people sitting in front of their webcams, trying to think of witty one-liners. Zoom provides the bare-bones of what regular people need to continue working remotely, but as a venue for the show, it stripped down a form of entertainment reliant on a number of external factors into nothing but sheer drive from comedians to ,. ,The big question is did it work? Not always, but ,rarely produces a show with nothing but outstanding sketches. As guest host Tom Hanks, who recently recovered from the coronavirus, said in his opening monologue, “It’s , — there will be some good stuff, maybe one or two stinkers.” Or to steal a traditional showbiz phrase, the show must go on. Ensuring that show goes on is much easier with a multi-billion dollar conglomerate behind it (,airs on NBC, which is a division of NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast) even without the props, cameras and sets its budget usually provides.,That was obvious in the sketches that made it to air. If Zoom was the stage, the format was more in line with what people might expect out of a YouTube upload or viral video on Twitter. Last night’s ,more closely resembled TikTok than the live show fans are used to, but with even more limitations. There wasn’t any physical comedy to drive home jokes — no spit takes, exaggerated falling, or weird body contortions. Outside of a couple of sketches, there weren’t even major collaborations among the comedians — a staple of , and the element that makes it a variety sketch show. ,Instead, comedians filmed from their bedrooms and basements. Kate McKinnon included her cat. Pete Davidson filmed on his street in suburban Staten Island, in front of a house he shares with his mom. They used makeshift green screen backgrounds on Zoom for any kind of visual gag. Technology effectively replaced physical props, becoming just as much a creative crutch, a safety blanket in the form of Zoom audio issues and Twitch live stream setups, as it was a means for distribution. ,That means certain sketches fell flat. Although ,has moved toward incorporating more digital sketches throughout the years, those are still based around multiple people appearing together. Since that was impossible for last night’s episode, ideas that might have worked well if there was more than one person in a video, didn’t have the same magic. Pete Davidson rapping about Drake’s new song in his basement is one example. ,Other ideas managed to pull it off by leaning into the format. Heidi Gardner’s popular Weekend Update character, a Bailey, finally got to record an entire episode of her movie review show on YouTube. Mikey Day became a Twitch streamer who sucks at ,in another sketch. Aidy Bryant used different Zoom backgrounds to guide viewers on a meditation journey. Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney (alongside special guest Fred Armisen) used a FaceTime call to turn a conversation into a song. It’s in these instances where ,zoomed in on the absurdity of our lives right now that jokes really landed, pun not intended.,Last night’s episode was one of the show’s most heartfelt, even if all-digital, remote episodes are not its future. ,couldn’t have accomplished what it did last night without the technology that allowed the team to collaborate, record, and edit from home, or without enough recognizable instances of daily tech use in our lives for ,to riff on. The things that ,managed to poke fun at — Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, FaceTime, Zoom — only work because tens of millions of people use them daily. ,found its moment of normalcy in satirizing the technology that brings us together right now — an attempt to redefine normal reflected in our own lives around the world.

Narcos: Mexico is a show for people who want the drug war to last forever,"
          Feb 14, 2020,  3:34pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"started as a show about Pablo Escobar, a real-life gangster who outdid even the most outrageous fictional ones. The show built a compelling two-season crime thriller around his astonishing life and death. But while Escobar died, , — a hit that premiered in 2015, when Netflix was rapidly building its streaming empire — needed to go on. A third season followed another Colombian cartel. Then a spinoff, ,, tracked a parallel cartel in Central America. The first season detailed its rise; the second chronicles its fall. If there was any point to all this, it’s become hard to keep track of. The show is too busy following the cocaine., is the story of Mexico’s first drug kingpin, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (Diego Luna). The 10 episodes that premiere this week detail the dramatic implosion of Gallardo’s empire, a collapse that makes for extremely bingeable television. Yet, despite the thrilling spectacle, exhaustion seeps in. Even though it aims at being something more, , doesn’t seem to have ambitions far beyond those of the criminals it follows, pushing more product. ,The second season of , wants to make a point about consequences, at least on a surface level. The collapse of Gallardo’s empire stems directly from brash actions taken during his ascent — most directly, the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña), which sends agent Walt Breslin on a reckless mission of retribution. There are also bridges burned along the way, friendships set ablaze to use as fuel for ambition that leave many eager to see Gallardo out of power. ,Throughout, , occasionally makes overtures at the grander significance of the story it’s telling. Across 10 episodes, Gallardo’s desperate maneuvers to retain control of his business and stick it to those who have slighted him have consequences that reverberate beyond the criminal underworld, ultimately resulting in a rigged presidential election. “Sound familiar?” the show’s narrator winks. ,There is a long series of assumptions in this, ideas that have been present in , from the start, even as it occasionally paid lip service to their subversion: that Central and South American nations are lawless playgrounds for the corrupt, where prosperity can only be seized by crooks and violence reigns. Every now and then , does its diligence to complicate this picture, almost entirely via narration: a tossed off line that notes the Mexican and Colombian drug trades exist wholly to serve the appetites of the wealthy in the US and Europe, or another about the fundamentally destabilizing influence of the United States’ foreign policy that created problems in exchange for the glow up of “solving” them. ,The actual moral universe of the show is far simpler: dope dealers deserve whatever’s coming to them, the bad guys often win, and the good guys should be able to do whatever it takes to stop them. , can’t truly complicate itself any further because doing so would acknowledge that all these stories are the same story, and in telling them, the show becomes complicit. Midway through the first season of ,, Gallardo (Diego Luna) leaves his native country for a secret meeting in South America. In a moment that’s designed to be a big surprise for longtime , fans, Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) is waiting for him. ,“I’ve always sort of seen this as of the Marvel superhero universe of connecting narcotraffickers, and that they all coexist,” showrunner Eric Newman , not long after the season premiered in 2018. It’s a crass way of describing the dynamics at play in these stories of cartels and corruption, but also a very American one. The gringos, as the Mexicans doing the dirty work for the cartel bosses say, always want more. And what better expression of “more” is there than the excesses of the modern cinematic universe? ,This is how , has carried on, and how it will carry on if it continues its run. Just as , harkened back to , with a well-deployed Escobar cameo depicting a meeting that likely never happened in the real world, the show continues to hint at the ways it will sprawl outward and continue telling these kinds of stories now that it has exhausted the drama of Gallardo’s Federation. It’s not subtle about it either, making sure in its first season that you know Gallardo’s driver Joaquín Guzmán goes by “Chapo” and spending a considerable amount of time this season laying the groundwork for rivalries that he will carry into the future, for what will be one of the most prolonged conflicts in the history of Mexico’s drug war. ,You could tell this story indefinitely, because it is still being told today, with every story of a white person enraged at the sound of Spanish being spoken, with every ICE raid, with every chant for the wall. Cartel dramas like , are fairy tales for a nation in decline, flattening diverse and complicated countries for the benefit of a nation that refuses to acknowledge the havoc it has wreaked on the world.

Characters are constantly saying things in a way that winkingly acknowledges the camera: ,The delivery always sounds like a dick joke, but the dick is Nazis. ,The slow-burn premiere introduces Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman), a Jewish teenager who lives in Brooklyn with his grandmother. When said grandmother is murdered in their home, Jonah discovers something she hid from the world: she was a member of a secret fraternity of Nazi-hunting vigilantes, exacting revenge on those conspiring to bring about a Fourth Reich. ,Headed by the wealthy Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino), the Hunters (if they sound like a superhero team, that’s intentional) methodically vet and seek out their victims and dole out painful justice on them, making sure they know exactly what crimes they are asking for. Interspersed throughout are interludes and flashbacks to concentration camps and the atrocities committed therein, lest the viewer start to feel that the Hunters are being a little , cruel. ,There are also strange diversions into dance, Guy Ritchie-style title cards but with a Yiddish exploitation twist, and fourth wall-breaking sketches. The villains monologue and salute a long-deceased Hitler with tears in their eyes. , is in the business of hurricane-force whiplash.,The only real anchors in all of this are the show’s two leads, Jonah and Offerman, and unfortunately, only one of them works. Despite being the de facto protagonist, Jonah doesn’t offer much to latch on to as a character. We get brief glimpses of his personal life — his friends, his crush, the anti-Semitic bully who tries to cheat Jonah out of the drugs he has to sell in order to help his grandmother pay the rent — but it’s all in the service of the plot. If we meet a person in his life, it’s because they’re going to ferry him to wherever he needs to be for the next scene to happen. ,This makes all of his big moments feel like they occur in a vacuum — especially when he’s paired up with the other Hunters, all of whom have a disappointingly small amount of screentime. Pacino is great. Everyone else makes you wonder what their deal is. (Also, Josh Radnor is on this show... why?),The five episodes that were made available in advance to critics leave things at a critical juncture halfway through the 10-episode season. Some of ,’ biggest thematic questions revolve around whether ends justify means or if the pursuit of vengeance risks corrupting those who seek it. These are familiar questions, perhaps even tired ones, but it’s possible that , comes up with an interesting answer. ,This is the upshot of a show as tonally uneven as ,: there’s no telling how it’s going to end. It’s hard to be optimistic. While the show does a lot of different things, one thing it doesn’t do is spend its time well. The first episode is nearly an hour and a half long; each of the four that follow clock in at about an hour. An inordinate amount of that time is spent mulling over a missed opportunity, longing for moments with the barely expressed rage of Pacino’s Offerman, or following any of the other Hunters instead of Jonah. It’s telling that, for all its stylistic quirks, the show is at its best when it’s playing it straight: the fourth episode, which tells twin stories of a bank heist and a couple’s desperate escape from a concentration camp, is among the best of the bunch and is delivered in a simple fashion. ,Like the eponymous team it follows, ,has a list of goals, and some of those goals are in conflict with one another. It wants to be a harrowing remembrance of the suffering of the Holocaust, a satisfying revenge fantasy, a sensational period piece, and a dark comedy. These can all be achieved together with skill, but only if the tension between them is acknowledged and addressed. Instead, the show shifts from tone to tone, more temperamental than genre-bending thrill ride.,It’s frustrating because even the ridiculous, preening Nazis of , share a trait that real-life fascists have: they know what they want. A show about the people who fight them should, too."
Dish Network floats merger with DirecTV over pace of cord-cutting,"

The drop in satellite customers isn’t nearly as bad as Dish reported a year ago, when it lost 386,000 subscribers, but it’s certainly not a good trend to see. All told, Dish lost a net total of 511,000 subscribers in 2019, compared to a loss of about 1.13 million in 2018. ,It’s that ongoing downward trend that led Ergen to comment that Dish and DirecTV “should get together,” noting that “the growth in TV is not coming from linear TV providers, but from huge programmers.” It’s not entirely clear what a merger would look like, given that DirecTV is currently owned by AT&T, but a sale of the satellite portion of AT&T’s TV business to Dish seems like a distinct possibility, especially given AT&T’s focus on new ,. ,Ergen went on to note that there would likely be regulatory issues to work out — after all, Dish and DirecTV already make up a considerable portion of the satellite market, and had already been barred from merging back in 2002 over concerns of eliminating competition. But the increased pressure from nontraditional internet TV services and streaming is taking a toll. “You just can’t swim upstream against a real tide of big players,” Ergen said. "
This disturbingly realistic deepfake puts Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in a Star Trek episode,"
          Feb 20, 2020,  3:35pm EST
        ",Jay Peters,"A new deepfake puts Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pilot episode of the original ,, “The Cage” — and I kind of love it. In this particular AI-powered face swap, Bezos plays a Talosian alien with a huge bald head, while Musk plays Captain Christopher Pike (who is the captain of the USS Enterprise before James T. Kirk). 	,Here’s a very short version of what’s going on in this scene, if you’re wondering: in this episode, the Talosian aliens capture Pike to enslave him and use him to breed humans that will be used to rebuild a destroyed society. Pike tries to escape throughout the episode, and eventually, the Talosians decide that humans’ resistance to captivity won’t make them a good fit for that plan.,The conversation is kind of hard to follow, and that’s probably because the clips from the episode are stitched together to make it seem like it’s only the Talosian alien and Captain Pike having a conversation. In the actual episode, there are a number of other characters who are critical to the conversation that this deepfake doesn’t show. ,But even though the scene is confusing, I think the deepfake is scarily impressive, particularly the unsettling-looking Bezos as a Talosian alien.

How The Mandalorian teamed up with Fortnite creator Epic Games to create its digital sets,"

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"One of the most impressive parts of , (other than ,) was the production design, with the varied locations, sets, and effects despite the comparatively lower budget for television as opposed to a blockbuster film. ,As it turns out, that’s because most of it wasn’t real. Rather, more than half of the season was shot using Industrial Light & Magic’s new StageCraft technology, which uses giant 20-foot-tall LED video screens to create fully digital environments as in-camera sets and backdrops, ,. ,Those environments are purely digital creations, which ILM ,, and then projected around the actors and physical set elements (like spaceship parts or speeder bikes) to create the finished project. As part of that effect, those LED screens are actually then shot on camera for a seamless effect that replicates location shooting without the costs. (The 3D environments are specifically lit and rendered from the perspective of the camera to accomplish that.),There are also real benefits to the virtual sets compared to a traditional green screen setup. Since the actors are actually on the set with the displays, they can see and react to things in the background while they’re actually shooting, instead of imagining effects that will be added later.,It also means that the lightning from those digital sets is present on set and interacting with the physical elements, like the actors and props. So shots where Mando and Baby Yoda sit around a fire, with the sunset shining off Mando’s armor still look right because that light is actually there on set. It’s just coming from an LED screen instead of an actual sun. ,Additionally, because the “sets” are just digitally projected 3D environments, they can be moved around and edited on the fly. Don’t like where a mountain is in the background for a particular shot? Simply move it around, or just delete it entirely. ,ILM had already been using effects like this on existing films, ,, where the “windows” of the Millennium Falcon were digital screens, allowing for the lighting effect of the hyperspace jumps to be projected on the actors’ faces in camera. But , took the technology to a much bigger scale, with a 270-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling that created a 75-foot-wide set.,Again, check out ILM’s video to get the full look at StageCraft. But best of all, ,’s first season is just the start for this new tech. The company announced today that it’ll be making StageCraft available for use by filmmakers and showrunners worldwide as an end-to-end solution, meaning that the digital set technology could be showing up in a lot more TV shows and movies in the future."

While looking up where to stream it, Google presented me with its “top voted tags” for the movie (I have no idea how these are generated), which were: slow, boring, pretentious, overrated, confusing, strong acting, and “+3 more.” ,, I thought.,One fascinating technique the film repeatedly uses is to obfuscate the beginnings of things and drop us into events well past when they’ve begun. The entire beginning of the central romantic relationship is left offscreen, as is all but the ending of a very significant argument between the couple. It’s disorienting and strange, but it helps to convey the feelings of the protagonist — suddenly in over her head, not entirely sure of how things got this way.,There’s apparently a sequel in the works. The film by no means calls for one, but I think there’s something very cool about making a sequel to a film that traditionally wouldn’t get one.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,After almost two years off the air, ,’s season 3 premiere is almost here.

Better Call Saul knows how much we love a good scam,"
          Feb 25, 2020,  3:09pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera," was always going to be a show about a man dying in slow motion. At the start of the series, Saul Goodman — best known as Walter White’s huckster lawyer in , — goes by another name, the one given to him at birth. Jimmy McGill is a different, more earnest person than Saul Goodman, someone who does not exist in ,. Unlike Walter White, we know exactly what’s going to happen to Jimmy, and ,is a better show for it. ,In the show’s fifth season, Jimmy’s transformation into Saul is nearly complete. McGill is getting his feet under him after the death of his brother and the end of a yearlong suspension from practicing law. Now, he’s back in the saddle and trying to build his practice as fast as possible under his Saul Goodman alias, which he used for much of the last season to build connections with petty criminals he sold burner phones to for fast cash. ,It’s all so very sad, even if Bob Odenkirk’s carnival barker performance as Jimmy / Saul is as entertaining and funny as it’s always been. As a man who lost his brother, Jimmy never gives himself the opportunity to mourn, instead throwing himself back into the world of two-bit hustles that he knows best, working over suckers and building his reputation in the untapped market of low-level criminals in the habit of committing misdemeanors. Bit by bit, Jimmy McGill is being buried alive, and Saul Goodman is holding the shovel. ,Like the show from which it spun off, ,’s dramatic arc is an inevitable one. We know that things aren’t going to end well from the start — to a degree that , might sound repetitive to people who have seen ,. On a superficial level, this is true: both are shows about a man going sour. But the hows and whys of ,’s downward slide feel more vital and relevant, perhaps because they are more tragic. ,If ,showed us what entitled toxic masculinity looked like when it ran rampant in the life of the most milquetoast protagonist imaginable, , is about a slower, sadder thing: a man who learns that having feelings is for suckers. It’s a show for the irony-poisoned and extremely online where nothing is assumed to be genuine, and everything is probably a scam. , is concerned with what happens when people decide that scamming is the only way to win, and the immense harm inflicted by people who have convinced themselves that anyone behaving earnestly is just playing the game wrong. In ,, this is illustrated by Kim Wexler, Jimmy’s longtime friend and girlfriend / partner, a damn good lawyer in her own right with a bit of a grifter’s streak in her. ,Kim, however, is a character of integrity with a sense of justice and lines that she only crosses when that notion of justice is violated. She’s a vigilante scammer where McGill is an equal-opportunity swindler. At the end of the day, she believes in the system and in Jimmy’s capacity to be an honest man. This means, in ,’s universe, she’s doomed. ,In this penultimate season — the show will only return for one more — Kim is learning a truth that Jimmy’s in denial of: no matter how much you tell someone that they are capable of being honest or good, once they have decided that truth does not pay, it’s only a matter of time before they stop maintaining the charade altogether. And once someone has lost every reason to believe in earnest feeling or honesty or justice, they slowly start believing everyone else has, too. ,This is what , has been building toward: a fifth season premiere where Jimmy, as Saul Goodman, erects a carnival tent in an empty lot, surrounded by people who he believes are lost causes who will eventually need a lost cause like himself. The descent is more or less complete. As Jimmy builds the Goodman name, the cartel power players from , begin asserting themselves, and the gilded cage Saul Goodman will ultimately try to flee at the end of that series is nearing completion. He’s going to have it good for a while, though. Grifters always do. That’s part of the problem: we love a good scam. Feelings are for suckers. "

Netflix’s Gentefied follows a Mexican American family in the heart of a gentrifying LA neighborhood,"

That’s the dark joke about being a young person of color in the US, where access to information is more equitable than the power to use that information. It’s easy to know exactly how you’re being shut out of opportunity and hard to do anything about it. For the Mexican family at the heart of ,, the game is clearly rigged, and winning it might cost more than it’s worth.,Netflix’s new half-hour dramedy from producer America Ferrera and writer / creator duo Linda Yvette Chavez and Marvin Lemus follows a trio of cousins who struggle to keep their grandpa’s taco shop afloat in Los Angeles’ Boyle Heights neighborhood. This is harder than it’s ever been: gentrification is sweeping through the neighborhood, slowly forcing the Chicano population out of town at a time when money isn’t easy to come by. ,Each cousin has their own dream in addition to the family one: Ana wants to be an artist and struggles to scrounge together expensive supplies and find a showcase for her work. Erik is torn between being responsible for running the shop and his desire to have a family of his own. Chris, just back from college, wants to be a chef in Paris, though it means stifling his Mexican heritage. ,In following the three of them and those in their orbit, , is both a celebration of a modern Mexican American family and also the story about their struggle against the ever-present threat of erasure. At every juncture, there’s something that wants them to forget who they are. In his studies to be a chef, Chris has developed an affinity for the upper-class, culturally sterile world of fine dining. Ana’s desire to find a platform for her art puts her at odds with her activist friends. Erik’s pride and machismo jeopardize the profitability of the shop and his relationship with Lydia, his estranged, pregnant ex who he wants to prove he’s good enough for. ,Lined up above them all are the invisible guillotines that dangle over many people of color in America. The ever-present call of the landlord; the racism of employers that must go unanswered, lest you lose your job; and the ambient threat of ICE officers who do not particularly care if you are a citizen. ,The show does seem to sometimes rely on a checklist, the kind that comes into play whenever there is a story about the slow infringement of wealthy white people on communities of color. A lot of the same tropes are present, whether it’s a show like , or ,or , before it. There are millennials who want all the same Instagram-friendly food and decor for taco Tuesday, landlords who would rather rent to said millennials at top dollar than the already-high rates they charge their current tenants of color, and the upper-middle-class institutions that only really want people of color if they clean up their act. (Read: be more white.),Because of this, ,is at its best when it gets specific: a midseason episode that follows a mariachi singer who frequents the taco shop, another that chronicles the lifelong friendship and romance between Ana and her girlfriend Yessika, or Chris’ ongoing struggles to prove to his fellow line cooks that he is “Mexican enough” and not a “coconut” (a term implying that he’s brown on the outside, white on the inside). ,Stories about the children of immigrants often revolve around the fundamental tension of being caught between the culture of their parents’ homeland and that of the home where they were raised. These kinds of stories are as old as immigration itself. In ,, there’s the modern wrinkle of “authenticity,” the monied interest in a culture sanitized for white consumption and social media clout without any concern for place, for people, for history. It is a constant pressure, easy to give in to and fun to participate in. ,It’s also impermanent. Soon, there will be something else. The tastemakers will move to another neighborhood, and no one will care for the accommodations once made for them. This is the existential threat facing the children of immigrants now. Fighting it seems impossible, an extra set of obstacles in addition to the regular set of hurdles you have to clear in order to achieve the better life your parents want for you.

        ",Nick Statt,"Gaming entertainment and e-sports organization Faze Clan is taking a unique approach to signing who it hopes will become the next big gaming star: a reality show. The Los Angeles-based company has partnered with yet-to-be-released streaming service Quibi to produce ,, a contest that will see six users of the Quibi app compete to be the next signed Faze member. To participate, contestants will need to ,. ,“Utilizing its interactive mobile technology, Quibi — along with key members of the Faze Clan — will open up one potential spot on the Faze Clan team. Then, Quibi subscribers will uniquely be able to submit a video pleading their case for a chance to join the team,” reads the show’s description. “Quibi subscribers will then vote through the Quibi app for the six lucky people that deserve a shot at gamer glory. From there, contestants will travel to the Faze Clan mansion to go through a series of real-life and gaming challenges, until one gamer — selected by Faze — is left standing.”,It’s an interesting concept that hasn’t really been seen in the e-sports industry. Most professional video game players today are scouted either through the top leaderboards and tournaments of popular titles like ,and , or they’re already well-known social media personalities with big followings on Twitch and YouTube. From there, an organization like Faze would sign a contract with the player to bring them onto its roster of talent, which can involve being a content creator or competing as part of an established e-sports team dedicated to a distinct title (in some cases, both).,A reality show approach, however, brings a much more dramatic and Hollywood-esque flair to the process that might appeal to a different type of gaming competitor or online creator. The description for , doesn’t say that potential contestants have to be top-tier in any one game or that they even need to have a substantial social media presence. ,So while it’s safe to say potential contestants will likely need to be avid gamers and probably talented in at least one or more titles, being virtuosic at gaming — like current Faze e-sports players — does not seem like a strict requirement. The selection process also appears to depend heavily on the user-submitted videos and the viewer-centric voting, meaning it could be more about having a dynamic personality than exhibiting impressive gaming skills. ,“Over the past 10 years, Faze Clan has not only contributed to the growth of the gaming lifestyle and the e-sports community, but we have broken barriers and are not afraid to disrupt the status quo,” said Oluwafemi Okusanya, Faze’s head of content, in a statement.  “In 2020, we plan to do the same with content creation and media distribution. The,show represents our next chapter in content creation with our first premium production effort.” ,Like its ,, Faze is as much an entertainment and lifestyle brand as it is a serious e-sports competitor. It maintains six well-funded and talented pro teams across a variety of the industry’s biggest games. That includes a newly minted, Atlanta-based ,League team that just ,. ,But Faze also maintains a growing apparel business and has a massive focus on brand deals, sponsorships, talent management, and professional video creation. A majority of the 85 or so official Faze members are not, in fact, e-sports athletes; instead, they’re content creators and influencers. Even ,. As , in a recent Faze profile last November, the company is “the Dallas Cowboys meets Supreme meets MTV.”  ,In that context, a reality show on a buzzed-about new streaming service like Quibi makes perfect sense for Faze. The company is working with media platform Whistle, which produces sports-related video and other content for various online platforms, to get the show up and running, and the plan is to start the contest with Quibi’s launch on April 6th.

The truth is that Google Fiber was forking over huge licensing fees to carry traditional TV channels, including big-name cable and sports networks. ,In many cases, what Google Fiber was paying was not the same as what competitors like Comcast and others pay to bundle traditional cable with internet service, due to legacy deals and vertical integration between internet service providers and cable companies. (For example, Comcast operates both its Xfinity cable and internet service while also owning NBCUniversal.) ,, “the cost of acquiring video content was ‘the single biggest impediment’ to Google Fiber’s wider rollout, a top Google Fiber executive, Milo Medin, told an audience in 2014. Compared with more established service providers, Medin said, Google was paying twice as much for video rights.” ,There are other issues, too. Google Fiber was offering a TV option — specifically an IPTV option and not cable or satellite — particularly so it could entice more traditional double- and triple-play customers in the Midwest and other midsize American cities, where Google Fiber was focusing its efforts early on. But the company has struggled over the past five years to make inroads in those markets as the cost of deploying fiber internet was astronomical and the challenge of beating out incumbents like Comcast became increasingly costly. ,In 2016, Google Fiber , amid a restructuring and a round of layoffs, after the company became a separate business unit under Alphabet proper and no longer existed under the core Google umbrella. (Moving Fiber outside Google meant it had more stringent financial obligations to turn a profit and not excessively waste money.) ,Google Fiber has since experimented with its Webpass subsidiary to try to deliver high-speed internet not through fiber optic cables, but with over-the-air transmission technologies. (In one market Webpass was deployed, Boston, Google eventually ,, too.) The company has also slowed its overall expansion considerably. As it stands today, Google Fiber is only available in 18 markets throughout the US. ,Last year, Google Fiber suffered yet another public defeat after it had to , after attempting a method of fiber installation called “shallow trenching” that would have sped up its deployment time, but that failed to hold up over time due to how close to the surface the cables were lying. Instead of starting over from scratch, Google Fiber decided to end service on April 15th of last year. Google Fiber is now , for botching the whole project. ,So it makes sense that, in 2020, Google Fiber doesn’t quite need a TV service that it pays a fortune for, especially as it’s still working to make its internet service an attractive option for consumers and a financially sound one for its parent company.

Netflix reveals that 76 million people watched at least two minutes of The Witcher,"

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,", and so are the first official numbers for Netflix’s latest streaming hit ,. The company says the series was watched by 76 million households, making it the most-watched first season of television ever for Netflix. That’s according to Netflix’s newly unveiled definition of “watched,” which it changed from “watched 70 percent of a single episode of a series” to anyone who “chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes.” ,In explaining the new metric, Netflix notes that the two-minute time period is meant to be “long enough to indicate the choice was intentional,” and it says that it follows similar metrics used by BBC’s iPlayer, YouTube, and ,’ measurements of page views. But the reasoning behind the change is obvious: to juice viewer numbers, with Netflix acknowledging that the new two-minute metric is “about 35% higher on average than the prior metric.” ,To put that number in perspective, two minutes of , is less time than it takes to reach the opening credits of the first episode; the action-packed cold opening is coincidentally two minutes and 16 seconds long. By Netflix’s new metric, anyone who watched just the opening scene of the episode (or 3.2 percent of the total runtime of the episode, which is itself one of eight episodes) is now counted as a view for the entire season. That is also shorter than the amount of time it would take to listen to the hit song “,,” which is also featured in the series.,Still, no matter how you slice it, 76 million households in the first four weeks is a lot of eyes on ,, which Netflix says is “tracking to be our biggest season one TV series ever.” And apparently that’s enough for Netflix to invest in the show for the long haul, as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said , is a “massive new franchise that we’ll develop season after season” in a ,.

Yet the data is a bit misleading. Netflix’s included chart relies on global Google search data.

Eighteen years after his last appearance in the movie ,, Picard is back in ,— a CBS All Access show that plays surprisingly well for people who have not seen a moment of , as well as longtime fans. , is trying to go somewhere new. Shockingly, it seems a little bit nervous about it.,takes place 18 years after the events of ,, the final film starring the crew of ,, and several years after Jean-Luc Picard has retired to his family vineyard. The retirement, we learn, was not one he wanted, spurred by his superiors’ handling of a cataclysmic disaster on Mars, the details of which are slowly fleshed out over the first few episodes. ,The premiere wastes no time getting Picard to leave that vineyard. Miles away, a young woman named Dahj is pursued by assassins for reasons unknown, but two things become clear: there’s something special about her, and Jean-Luc Picard is the only man who can help her. So she quickly makes her way to his doorstep, and the adventure begins. , is a mystery on two fronts: One set in the recent past, peeling back the layers of what went wrong on Mars, and another in the present revolving around Dahj’s identity.

So it was a wonderful surprise watching ,, one of the first World War II movies I’ve seen in some time that actually has something meaningful to say.,The film does a brilliant job of satirizing the harmful ways people are divided by language and fear. It focuses on a young boy in 1940s Germany who subscribes to Nazi ideology to fit in. It mostly leads to sadness and embarrassment as he begins to realize that everything he’s been told is wrong.,Some of the most revealing moments are big and obvious, like another child being surprised to see that everything he’d learned about Jews was a lie. But the best moments are the quiet ones, when the adults nod along, knowing the lies retold by children are outlandish, but declining to say so. Now as much as ever, it feels like an important issue to explore.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Disney+’s next big , release is a new season of ,, a much-loved animated series that hasn’t had new episodes since 2014. Disney is billing this as the show’s final season, so this isn’t exactly a way to keep Disney+ filled with new , content. But the rest of the show is available to stream, too, which should mean there’s plenty for people who haven’t seen the series yet. The new season debuts February 21st.,It doesn’t really matter whether , is a very good documentary or not — it has intimate access to Taylor Swift, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of her latest album, and promises to explore much of the drama that surrounds her: people are going to watch it one way or another.

It comes out May 29th.,Let’s just start by acknowledging that , is a good title, and that having Alison Brie star is a good decision. From there, I have no idea, and I’ll just say this truly feels like a Netflix movie — not exactly a must see, but very much an O,. It has Brie starring as a lonely woman who seemingly starts to lose it, or be abducted, or probably turn into a horse or something. The film comes out February 7th.,From the name of this movie and still on this trailer, you could easily assume that this is a rom-com about some dapper musician in London. It’s actually a revenge thriller that has Blake Lively stepping into a Bond-like role after being swept up into some conspiracy. It comes out January 31st.,After the international success of ,, one of director Jia Zhangke’s earlier films is getting a US release. His 2010 film ,is a gorgeously shot documentary about China’s modern history, as seen through the last century in Shanghai. It starts to hit US theaters this weekend, starting in New York.,Apple TV Plus has a documentary coming up looking at LGBTQ representation on TV. The eight-hour series includes interviews with Ellen DeGeneres, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow, and quite a few other famous faces, as well as narration by Margaret Cho, Neil Patrick Harris, Lena Waithe, and more. It comes out February 14th., director Dee Rees returns with a film about a journalist who somehow gets tied up in an illegal arms trading scheme. The movie stars Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck and looks like it twists into a socio-political thriller. It comes out February 21st.,Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots star in this strange sci-fi movie about a couple who become trapped in a neighborhood of identical homes and are forced to raise some kind of freaky clone baby. It seems fun, and I’m assuming there’ll be some cutting criticism of suburbia in here. There doesn’t appear to be a release date just yet.

        ",Joshua Rivera,"According to its ,, , is “an anthology of funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring, and surprising stories about the lives of immigrants in the United States.” Its first season, released this month on the streaming service, is a collection of eight half-hour stories about immigrants who are trying to make it in the US. It’s the best show Apple has produced so far, but it’s also the most misguided. ,It almost hurts, considering the talent behind ,. Created by Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Lee Eisenberg, just about every episode is an excellent half-hour of television. Each actor on-screen is wonderful to watch, warm and likable at all times. The array of brown faces in front of and behind the camera is dazzling: Uchenna “Conphidance” Echeazu, Eshan Inamdar, Kemiyondo Coutinho, and Tze Chun are actors and filmmakers from a wide variety of backgrounds. The stories they tell (all based on real life) stop just shy of being saccharine.,The trouble is the framing. Like many immigrant stories, they are about overcoming or confronting nigh-insurmountable hardships. In “The Manager,” protagonist Kabir is 12 years old when his parents are deported, and he must take over the family motel, raising himself and running a business while writing obsessively to the government about his parents being readmitted into the country. He will not see them in person again until he is an adult.  In “The Son,” a gay Syrian man flees his family who reacted violently to discovering his orientation, crossing the border into Jordan in the hopes that he can one day claim asylum in the United States. “The Rock” is about an Iranian father who wants to purchase a home in the US but cannot afford it. Instead, he buys a plot of land with a massive, unremovable rock on it and commits to removing it, one chunk at a time. The house is never built.,Because , positions these stories as “inspiring,” it’s worth thinking about why. ,The idea is that we do not see these people represented very often — people who, in the real world, suffer all manner of prejudice and setbacks because they have dared to live a life in a country that is not made for them, even as it postures as the land of opportunity. ,, and works like it, exist as an act of empathy: look at these people. They just want the same simple things you do. A home, a business, a job, love. There are so many shades to the same story. ,But the exceptional nature of ,’s subjects plays into the idea that immigrants must earn our empathy, earn the right to be in the US, earn the mere chance to find happiness. In the US, stories like these are treated like a guidebook for citizenship if you’re a person of color and “inspiring” fodder for white people who want to believe themselves tolerant.,In another, more equitable pop culture landscape, maybe ,would land better. There is room for stories like these, and it bears repeating: it’s pretty good television! What hurts the series most is its frequent refusal to acknowledge that there are , its characters struggle with such hardship. In ,, coming to the United States to make a life is just ,, and the reasons are irrelevant — when, in fact, they are vital. ,The episodes that rise above this are the ones that show , each character faces the plight they do. “The Son” makes it immediately clear why a gay man must flee his Syrian family. In “The Grand Prize Expo Winners,” a Chinese woman wins a cruise for herself and her children. During their time at sea, her dreams of the American life she has obtained and the dreams her children have after being raised in the US come into quiet conflict. The bittersweet nature of the immigrant experience is made tangible for half an hour. ,These episodes are the exceptions. A good second season of , (which is already on the way) would follow their lead. A better one would ditch our cultural fixation on immigrant struggle porn entirely. ,There is dignity in being unremarkable. A noble life can be lived by those who are not paragons, by people getting by on wages too small in homes that do not fit their families in less-than-desirable neighborhoods. , wants its audience to regard immigrants as fully realized people.

Hulu CEO steps down as Disney moves almost everything in house,"

        ",Julia Alexander,"Randy Freer is stepping down from his role as Hulu CEO as Disney moves to consolidate its direct-to-consumer business under its own executives. Part of the decision to roll Hulu’s business operations into Disney’s direct-to-consumer division is to help “rapidly grow our presence outside the US,” according to a company press release put out Friday. ,Disney hasn’t shied away from its plans to roll out Hulu in various international territories, along with its ,.

Disney’s direct-to-consumer division is centralized, giving executives within the division more control over their streaming businesses. And the push to fold Hulu into that department became inevitable after Disney fully acquired the streaming service in , ,Not to mention that following Disney’s acquisition, Hulu’s senior vice president of scripted content, Craig Erwich, stopped reporting to Freer and ,.

As Disney began to cancel most of its Marvel series on Hulu, using Disney+ instead as the main platform for Marvel series that connected to the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, Loeb started ,.

The best anime of 2019,"
          Jan 31, 2020,  1:50pm EST
        ",D. M. Moore,"Hundreds of new anime series come out every year, so it can be difficult to pick out which ones are actually worth watching. With each new anime season, , tries to point fans to interesting new shows via , ,. But it can be hard to judge a series by its cover — or at least by the first few episodes. Some of the best shows each year don’t always make it into those previews. To highlight all of the shows that stood out after a complete watch, we’ve assembled this list of the best new anime of 2019. While it won’t be entirely comprehensive — it only includes series we’ve watched and finished — everything on the list is something we can unequivocally recommend.,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind,A few years back, I wrote a list of recent shows that would be , to anime. The recommendations in it were divided by genre to point people toward avenues they already liked. , has become the show I flatly recommend when asked for suggestions — a series so good it would get the same attention prestige dramas do, if only it were live-action. ,For the animation studio behind the series, WIT, it feels like their capstone work for the decade. It demonstrates everything they learned from making action shows like , and ,, to character dramas such as , and ,. , captures all of that experience and focuses it into a story full of memorable characters, amazingly animated action scenes, and great character drama in the midst of much bigger historical moments. If I had to pick a single best show of the decade, let alone the year, it would be hard not to choose ,.,In , science is a superpower, but it is never used as magic to handwave away something complicated. Instead it relishes in the details, and in the trial-and-error and hypothesizing. At its core, the show is actually about being a scientist: the importance of knowledge, of being inquisitive about the world, and of being ethical in what you use technology to do. It makes science fun by demonstrating how magical it can be, and then shows you how anybody can become a wizard.,is a charming show that forgoes the idea of wish fulfillment. Most shows that feature characters reincarnated in fantasy worlds give them amazing, unique powers. ,instead focuses on an adult librarian taking over the body of Myne, the sickly five-year-old daughter of a poor city guard. It becomes more about the everyday struggles of Myne and her family as she uses her knowledge from our world to try and make books, but also improve the lives of her family and friends without arousing suspicion that she isn’t the real Myne. It’s a show that is ideal for the whole family, or as a way to relax. Even in its most stressful moments, , just feels nice to watch.,It isn’t rare for the anime version of a manga to elevate the source material, as adaptations often rewrite characters or moments of the story with better foresight about later developments. And the addition of sound and animation can expand on and enhance moments in ways just not possible in the comic form. What’s rare about ,’s adaptation is the consistency with which the animation and voice acting enhances the work, not just for specific important scenes, but every episode.,The spectacular action scenes are most noticeable — they’re stylish and easy to follow, even when seemingly impossible things are occurring. In smaller, subtler moments, the animation and voice acting breathe life into the characters and make them more endearing. The best example of this is the way protagonist and titular demon slayer Tanjiro looks genuinely sad when killing a demon. He has genuine pity for them, even though they’re terrible, irredeemable monsters. He has to continue to humanize them, so he can justify continuing to travel with his now-demon sister, looking to cure her. Small characterizations like this speak volumes by making the spectacular climactic moments more emotionally meaningful.,The concept of , a girl starts living with two cousins who both turn into different animals from the Chinese zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex — makes it sound like a comedy romance series in the vein of ,. But , isn’t so lighthearted. It’s more of an emotional gut-punch, episode after episode, as it reveals the terrible things that have happened to each of the characters. They’re never quite what you expect them to be.,But the show isn’t all sadness. It’s an amazingly hopeful story about finding acceptance, finding a family, and working through issues — not with quick solutions, but through sustained care. It finds a great balance between drama, romance, and comedy, which makes those devastating moments land particularly hard., is stressful, hilarious, awkward, heartwarming, melodramatic, cringeworthy, and absolutely brilliant. The show follows the five girls of a high school literature club as they collectively start thinking about sex and adult relationships for the first time. They’re all individually attempting to figure out their feelings and sexuality, and their stories interconnect as they collectively support (and sometimes impede) each other., in some ways is similar to a show like ,, except without the focus on nostalgia and cringe humor. Instead, the show goes for drama with dashes of comedy. It ranges from more lighthearted, cute romantic fare to frank discussions and storylines about queer romance, teen pregnancy, and possibly inappropriate (and sometimes , inappropriate) relationships with adults. It’s a testament to the writing that it manages to deftly navigate tricky subject matter without being problematic or preachy., is a show about Karou, a young single office worker, and the strange lazy bear Rilakkuma who comes to live in her apartment. While Rilakkuma is something of a freeloader, he effectively earns his place in the apartment by teaching Kaoru how to relax from the stresses of her work and relative lack of social life, by finding enjoyment in everyday things. That makes it an incredibly relaxing show. And the amazing stop-motion animation work adds a charming tactility. ,, which makes it marvelously smooth and lively.,The second season of , feels as though there wasn’t a three-year break after the first season. The show continues to be an amazing animation showcase, and watching it often feels like the animators at Bones, the studio that animated both seasons, are showing off and having ,. But what makes both seasons great is the sense of humor and heart on display.,This new season goes to some darker places than the first season. It’s less focused on testing the incredible psychic powers of middle-schooler Mob and more focused on testing his empathy and maturity as he grows up and becomes a person rather than an ultra-powerful psychic force of nature. Even with the darker tone and themes, a wonderful sense of absurdity and humor still grounds the whole series and keeps it from losing its relatability.,Some anime series start off with such strange conceits that they either completely put the audience off or become utterly captivating to understand. , is that sort of show. It follows three middle school boys who get turned into mythical creatures called kappas. They’ll only become human again if they steal a fictional desire-organ from inside the butt of a spirit monster that’s magically stealing items from the city to serve an evil empire of otters.,The real crux of the show, which is hidden beneath all the strange kappa and otter mythological imagery, is personal and human. It’s about exploring the ways we connect with those around us and what those connections mean. It’s a great follow-up for fans who watched , when it hit Netflix and are ,. But despite how weird it can get with all the kappa butt stuff, anyone could enjoy this show. It’ll likely be talked about for years to come, not just for the writing, but for the animation as well.,Early on, , feels like it’s writing a check it has no chance of being able to cash. It seems unlikely we’ll get any significant character development for the 10 different main characters, and their transition from not even amateur runners to one of the top college-marathon teams in Japan seems like it would be fantastical at worst and dubious at best.,Yet, over the course of its 23 episodes, the series presents a convincing story by being less about the sport than about these college students figuring out their lives in the present and future. The running acts as a constant that forces them all to interact, confronting issues in their lives while coming together as a group. This all climaxes in the show’s final episodes: as they run their section of a competitive two-day relay, they reflect on everything that’s happened. The ending only works because of how much the audience knows and cares about the characters, having seen so much of what they’ve gone through.,’s anime adaption is incredibly faithful, but it’s also a fascinating interpretation of the source material about the oldest kids at a secluded orphanage learning that they are actually being raised as food for demons. The manga is fundamentally more of a thriller, while the anime takes on a more horror-like quality. It’s not because they changed anything in the text of the work; it’s because of the way , Mamoru Kanbe visually approached it. Conversations as the kids secretly plan or try to work out what new information they have, are shot in an almost voyeuristic fashion, like the camera is spying on them from around a dark corner. The style adds to the creeping dread of these scenes in a way that isn’t found in the manga.,Even with all that, Emma, who is effectively the lead protagonist, is a breath of fresh air. She exudes a caring and optimism that serve as the driving force for keeping the characters moving forward, while affecting the way they think about approaching problems. She’s never presented as too naïve or not smart enough to understand her dire situation, though, which keeps the show from getting too dark or despairing to enjoy.,initially looks like it’s going to be a wish-fulfillment power fantasy. It’s about a middle-aged Tokyo man who dies while protecting his co-worker from being stabbed. But before completely dying, he awakens in a fantasy world as a low-level slime monster in a cave. Thanks to some strange abilities given to him as part of his transference to this fantasy world, he’s able to absorb items and creatures, allowing him to use and combine their abilities. After befriending a powerful dragon and receiving its blessing, he sets out to learn more about the new world he’s a part of.,The subsequent story could just be about him using his cool new powers in a fantasy world to get everything he ever wanted. Instead, the show is full of empathy. Rimuru is incredibly overpowered, but they understand that while they are possibly indestructible, others aren’t. So they end up using that power like a well-meaning middle manager, knowing how to delegate, and when and how to correctly protect and support others. This all adds a charm to the show, as the drama and story becomes less about Rimuru and more about those around them., has the intensity and mind games of ,, except it’s a bizarre rom-com about two people who like each other and are trying to get the other one to admit it first. Kaguya is vice president of the student council at a prestigious private school and heiress of a rich and powerful family. Student council president Miyuki is from a less auspicious family but is one of the most popular students at school. ,The concept is an interesting twist on a high school rom-com, but that alone isn’t enough to put it on this list. The show’s animation adds so much to the tension and emotional stakes of each scene, with incredibly stylized shots and exceptionally well-animated moments. These shots often elevate the absurdity of the dramatic confrontations, which are comedically great when you remember how trivially stupid the stakes are here, with both characters scheming to get the other person to ask them out. This isn’t a will they / won’t they show. It seems obvious that they’ll eventually come together. It’s just about watching the bizarre antics as these two would-be lovers stumble over their pride.,From the previews, , gives every indication that it’s going to be a cute show about a guy who adopts a cat. Instead, it’s a humorous, heartfelt show about social anxiety, trauma, and depression. It doesn’t just explore this through the secluded author Subaru, who’s dealing with the sudden death of his parents; it explores the same things with Haru the cat, who has her own issues from trying to take care of her siblings when they were abandoned.,The series shows almost everything from both Subaru and Haru’s perspectives, which helps contextualize Haru’s reactions to what Sabaru sees her do. Mainly, it shows how the growing connection between the two helps them find a better balance in their lives where their issues aren’t a constant impediment. It’s not a flashy show with amazing animation, but it tells a poignant story about mental health with the right amount of humor.,Where to start in talking about , It’s such an odd combination of action, body horror, fashion, and meta-referential musician references. For fans who’ve watched the series since part 1, it might all seem pretty normal now. But coming into this latest series fresh could be jarring. Still, this season, the fifth part of the series, works as a standalone piece since it’s narratively separate from the previous chapters. , turns the show into a story about internal strife in an Italian mafia full of people with ridiculous psychic abilities.,The series is ostensibly built on putting its characters in incredibly melodramatic and increasingly ridiculous situations. For instance, the main crew gets stuck on a train with someone who is trying to kill them with his ability to make people age quickly in enclosed spaces. So they hide in a living room created by a psychic turtle inside its shell. , makes the characters so appealing that wondering how they’ll get out of these situations matters more than the completely incomprehensible nature of their problems., manages to really distill this aspect of the series by offering up a small crew of people the viewers really want to root for. They’re gangsters, but their camaraderie and backstories, which reveal how they came to be so close, make them engaging. So does the constant danger they experience, especially since they usually don’t make it out unscathed. The audience’s constant concern for their safety feels justified. It isn’t just manipulative melodrama without consequences."
The Good Place finale is a gentle end to a challenging show,"
          Feb  3, 2020,  3:56pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"For four years, , felt like one of the most radical shows on television. A series that was initially about what happens when the wrong person goes to heaven transformed into a meditation on what it means to be a good person, and how no one is beyond redemption. That it aired during a time where cruelty led to a parade of demoralizing victories in politics and culture made it feel even more miraculous, a kind show for mean times. With its series finale, ,chose not to overstay its welcome, ending gently with a 90-minute conclusion that held no surprises — except, maybe, how disappointing fulfillment can be. ,“Whenever You’re Ready” begins its long goodbye with every conflict in the series resolved in the previous episode. Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, Tahani, Michael, and Janet have arrived in heaven and devised a perfect, equitable afterlife for all humans to go through. Upon death, everyone enters a time of testing and reflection, which they must pass in order to enter The Good Place. Once a person is in, they stay until they’re ready to walk through a door and fade into nothingness.,As the episode unfolds, each character eventually finds fulfillment and decides to leave, one at a time. First are Jason and Tahani, characters who have been underserved by the show for some time now, mostly reduced to one-note jokes. The show makes up for that a little: Jason’s departure is a small fake out; he ends up being stranded outside of the final door for eons because he forgot to give something to Janet. In doing this, he learns the inner peace and patience that makes him attain, inadvertently, the kind of spirituality he pretended to have at the start of the show as a silent monk. ,Tahani decides to not go through the door, instead choosing to try her hand at becoming an afterlife architect — a move that signals a shift in her ambitions, applying them to the service of others instead of herself. It’s a nice ending, but one that underlines a solid two seasons of missed opportunities for the character. ,The finale’s heart, however, is with the character , started with: Eleanor Shellstrop, who still has a few lessons to learn. The first involves letting go and accepting Chidi’s decision to go through the last door. The second is in helping someone else learn to let go, convincing the Middle Place’s sole inhabitant, Mindy St. Claire, to finally give up her post and enter the rebuilt afterlife. Finally, Eleanor guides Michael to the one ending that would make him truly happy: a mortal life.,There are beautiful moments in this. Despite the long-standing criticism of Chidi and Eleanor’s relationship remaining valid — the two have never worked as much as the show believed they did — actors William Jackson Harper and Kristen Bell pour their hearts into their final scene together, with a conversation about oblivion that is life-affirming and not an existential terror. The brief few moments we see of Michael’s human life are wonderfully endearing. It’s all a very nice ending for a very nice show. ,It all feels a little hollow, though. , at its best was often about how being good was ,. It is difficult and prone to going awry; your ideas of what constitutes “good” might not ultimately translate to a net positive in the cosmic balance. This is why, , argued, we need friends — other people who wanted to be good to others as much as you did, and who had different ideas about how to do that. ,Attempting to live a good life often feels like it isn’t rewarding or ultimately worth it, but ,’s best moments showed that you could build a community where it , worth it, an internal dynamic built around justice and fulfillment that, with time and good fortune, might radiate outward and change someone’s life. ,There is uncertainty in this. We don’t really get to know the kind of impact we have, if we make one at all. At the apex of ,’s storytelling prowess — the season 2 finale, “Somewhere Else” — ,the show,dug into this idea, with each character having a second chance at a mortal life. With no memory of her previous life or afterlife, Eleanor tries to live ethically, and it goes poorly. The episode ends with Eleanor nudged in the direction of finding Chidi and her former friends, and fades to black before she gets there. , I loved wasn’t one that trafficked in certainty about anything. It was a show about ,, about a secular faith in living a noble life without the guarantee of a material reward. It showed a cast of chronically selfish people learning to mitigate their selfishness by caring more for each other, even in the face of a cartoonishly elaborate demon bureaucracy that wanted them to believe none of that mattered. It was nice to see them be rewarded in the end. I want to believe they would’ve done it all the same, even if they weren’t.  "

It’s a great movie with a tough political viewpoint that feels all its own, at least among (arguably) mainstream films.

So often, stories are left out there like singular, pristinely drawn objects that could only ever have existed one way. In a (since deleted) , , ,, Riley spoke to other ways the screenplay could have been crafted and why he landed on certain characterizations and events.,If you’ve seen the film already, it’s worth a read.

The Hooded Justice episode, in particular, was worth watching the entire season for. That hour is perhaps a better encapsulation of the show than the entirety of the show, and it feels so true to the book that it hardly seems like it wasn’t in there in the first place.,I did find the series’ structure a little frustrating, though. Very little actually happens during the timeline of the show — there’s a murder, some flashbacks, and then the ending arrives. Nearly everything important occurred before the show started, and we just have to wait for characters to reveal to us what they’ve already done. Those twists and turns add up to something interesting, I just wish it had felt a little more like that scheming was happening in the present, rather than like we were waiting for a “republic serial villain” to lay things out for us when the time is right.,Check out seven trailers from this week below.,Marvel put out a short new teaser for , this week.

        ",Joshua Rivera,"It was the Rorschach mask in the glove box that sold me. ,, HBO’s sequel / reinvention of the comic of the same name by Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore, came out the gate swinging with a prologue set during the 1921 Tulsa race riot. But it was the next scene that got me fully on board, one that showed that Rorschach, the original comic’s most popular character, was a hero to white supremacists. It felt transgressive but also right — and then I flipped back to the comic and you know what? It ,right. The TV , sold me on its relevance by resurfacing something incredibly obvious about its source material that years of fan culture had scrubbed away, mostly because the character looked cool. ,There’s an understandable urge to laud popular culture that ,, to credit shows or movies that address injustices or give a platform to the marginalized. It’s a good impulse, even if it leads to overly forgiving criticism. So it’s important to note that, while , is definitely one of this year’s best shows for the provocative way it centers race in a way that both mainstream entertainment and pundits often do not, it’s also incredible for being fun as hell. There’s time travel, killer action, a deep conspiracy, and a great love story. There’s a lot there — maybe too much to end well. And you know what?

As a cultural touchstone, however, it’s been a disaster, inspiring a whole generation of creators and fans who were more fascinated in its “realistic” take on superheroes than its pervasive ideas about a world marching toward its own annihilation, and the cultural attitudes that brought it to the brink of doomsday. ,One way to measure the success of HBO’s , has been how satisfying it is to watch the show completely rewrite its source material, trading its anxieties for current ones, taking its criticisms of superhero fiction and extending it further to make it a criticism of power and the whiteness of that power. In this new ,, superheroes aren’t just the purview of thrill-seekers and proto-fascists.

We all wanted to be heroes, but white faces were the only ones behind all the masks and superpowers, by design. ,And so, across the eight episodes leading up to this finale, , took a sledgehammer to this foundation. It corrected its fictional history the way we have begun to correct our real one, re-centering the main thrust of its stories on the people of color previously ignored. Hooded Justice, the first superhero, is not the white man historians assumed he was, but a black hero born from the trauma of the Tulsa race riot and refused justice at every turn by the racist country he tried to serve, first in war, and then with a badge. Doctor Manhattan, the godlike superhuman, is reinvented under the guise of Cal Abar, a black man living in Oklahoma. The villain of the show is a folksy white senator, friendly and seemingly well-intentioned, secretly leading a cabal of racists who want to help him steal the powers of a god, simply because he feels entitled to take them. ,The ,comics are celebrated because they challenged popular notions about superheroes and comics, changing our perceptions of what they could be. Over thirty years later, HBO’s , is doing the same thing, by upending the foundation of , itself. If it never gets a second season, that’d be enough — even if the finale doesn’t quite stick the landing."
The Lost finale was the decade’s most underrated ending,"

        ",Jay Peters," series finale, “The End,” is my favorite finale of any TV show — but not because it solved all of the show’s many mysteries. It didn’t., was ABC’s smash hit about the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 and the island where they crashed. The show was great at character-driven stories and showing how the island (generally) turned them all into better people, but it did so in an exciting way by making those stories play out among the many mysteries, questions, and curiosities of the island.,Throughout six seasons of these dangling questions, I — like many other fans — was ready for answers. But by the time of the finale, it was becoming clear that we weren’t going to get the mind-melting revelations we were hoping for. , represented, among other things, candidates to replace an immortal being that ruled the island? Hmm. The smoke monster was made when that being threw his brother into a magical cave of light? Uh, okay.,And in the finale, we finally learned that the island kept its mystical energy because... a plug in a pool kept the island’s magical water from draining away. Following season after season of increasingly clever answers to increasingly clever mysteries, seeing the banal reality of a giant drain stopper was something of a letdown.,But I loved the finale anyway. Instead of checking off every box, executive producers Carlton Cuse (who has since created , and Amazon’s , series) and Damon Lindelof (, and HBO’s ,) instead packed the finale with as many unforgettable character-driven moments as they could. And that, in retrospect, is what the show was , the best at the whole time, anyway. Who can forget iconic moments like “,,” the reveal of the show’s ,, and ,?,Ironically enough, the finale made its character moments really shine by paying off , mystery in a huge way. Season 6 played with , trope of flashbacks or flash-forwards by instead presenting flash-,a weird alternate reality where Oceanic Flight 815 didn’t crash. In the flash-sideways, the characters apparently have no knowledge of their connections on the island. The audience doesn’t know what the point of the flash-sideways was — until they reach the series finale. By that time, the audience knows that the show’s characters can “wake up” from the flash-sideways and suddenly recollect their lives on the island.,These sepia-toned recollections are powerful flashes of each character’s most memorable plots throughout the entire show, usually with their one true love, and each is backed by the very best of Michael Giacchino’s amazing soundtrack. The finale gives us ,: , how they rekindled their relationship and eventually died together. , how they fell in love. , their amazing, wonderful, best-ever relationship. ,These moments of recollection in the finale were beautiful when I first watched the final episode live in May 2010. But when I recently rewatched the episode, sitting next to the person I would marry six days later, these scenes , me. I cried at every single one.,I’ve come to realize that the point of the finale, and perhaps all of ,, wasn’t to get answers to the plot questions that got many of us to care about the show in the first place. (That is something I also think is true about most of the recent enduring prestige TV dramas, including ,, ,, and, yes, even ,.) The point was to deliberately show that the real journey, and I mean this with no irony, was the friends the characters made along the way — and maybe that’s what the journeys of our real lives are, too."

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"Alright everyone, it’s time for ,. I’m writing this before I’ve seen the new movie, so instead I’m going to write about ,, which I think did some very smart things to set up this film, even if it may have also made life a little trickier for J.J. in other ways, too.,The smartest thing , did for the trilogy was kill off Snoke — an empty plot device — and set up Kylo Ren as the ultimate villain. The absolutely palpable tension between Rey and Kylo (and more broadly, their shared battle between light and dark) gives the story a core worth caring about. The trilogy is all about these two people, even if, you know, the entire galaxy is at stake too. (Trailers suggest , brings in a new ultimate villain, and I question whether that’s the right decision.),What I think makes things trickier is how , ends. It’s fully open for Abrams to take where he’d like. That may be quite freeing, but it also means that — despite being eight films into a nine film saga — there’s no obvious next step, let alone an end point beyond the good guys winning this round. Abrams keeps talking about tying up eight films’ worth of plot, but the problem is, that’s not really true. It’s mostly just been film after film, without a clear trajectory. I think that’s part of the fun of these movies, but it also makes for difficult endings when so much of the framework has to be established within the final movie.,Check out 11 trailers from this week below.,(P.S. I’m off for the holidays next week, but I’ll see you all again in 2020!),Here’s the latest from Christopher Nolan. ,, which he wrote and directed, appears to be  a time-bending action thriller that has its heroes trying to stop a bad guy or something (IDK they mention World War III and nukes) while other characters are going backward in time in front of them. The visual effect is very trippy and a little weird to watch, but I imagine it’ll make for a cool premise. The film comes out July 17th. (I must note, I’m not sure I’ve seen a trailer before that ends with the message: “SEE THE TRAILER IN THEATERS FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT.” What effect? What? Vision? It’s just bigger!),I didn’t realize this when the first trailer for , came out: the entire film is presented as if it were a single unbroken shot. Long takes are an effect that can easily be misused, but I get the impression that it makes a lot of sense here — the film is about two soldiers racing across France to deliver an urgent message about an impending ambush, and the unbroken shot should play up the impact of that ticking clock. It comes out January 10th.,I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a trailer quite like this. The new trailer for , is basically just a triumphant dose of nostalgia — two minutes of ,Top Gun,? — without actually getting into the substance of the movie at all. But I guess substance doesn’t matter here. It’s Tom Cruise. It’s ,. We know what we’re gonna get. It comes out June 26th.,The latest from my boy Joe Wright (director of the 2005 ,) is a ,-style thriller that has a woman confined to her home trying to unravel a murder she believes she’s witnessed.

Despite the cute mashup, the premise and world somehow still feel familiar, and it’s kind of tempering my interest.

The film comes out March 6th. ,Written and directed by Eliza Hittman, , is about a teenage girl who travels from rural Pennsylvania to New York City to get an abortion, where consent of a parent isn’t required.

Each episode features a story about a person or family trying to move to or otherwise make it in America.

"Netflix’s The Witcher is a dark, funny, and faithful adaptation of the fantasy series","
          Dec 20, 2019,  3:01am EST
        ",Andrew Webster,"You learn nearly everything you need to know about , hero Geralt (Henry Cavill) a few minutes into the first episode. The titular witcher — a work-for-hire monster hunter with some helpful superpowers — is first seen in a swamp, nearly killed by a giant spider monster, beaten and almost drowned. In the next scene, Geralt heads to a local pub for information on his next quest, only to be subjected to ridicule and scorn from villagers who are scared of his supernatural nature. Ultimately, he’s saved from a barroom brawl thanks to a helpful young woman, who very quickly becomes a romantic partner.,The Netflix adaptation captures the enigmatic hero perfectly. He’s struggling to survive in a world that hates him, stubbornly sticking to a moral code that forces him into dangerous  situations. He’s gruff and sarcastic, always down for a fight, impossibly charming, and frequently irresistible. It’s a premise that worked well in book and video game form — and now it’s one of the best series on Netflix., is based on a series of fantasy novels from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which reached a new level of global popularity thanks to a series of video games. ,, in particular, propelled the franchise to blockbuster status. Every iteration follows Geralt, part of an ancient and dwindling line of monster hunters known as witchers. They’re mutated from a young age to be stronger and faster, and the process also gives them limited magical abilities and prolonged life spans. Geralt is a gunslinger type, moseying into a town in trouble, slaying the inevitable magical beast, collecting his pay, and moving on.,In this way, , is different than most fantasy stories, including obvious contemporaries like ,. It does have the elements of a vast epic tale — including plenty of political machinations and lots of warring kingdoms — but at its best, , is like a fantastical detective series, with Geralt investigating dangerous magical creatures and inevitably being pulled into much bigger conspiracies.,What makes the new show work so well is the way it seamlessly blends together these two types of storytelling. There , an interesting overarching story. In addition to Geralt, the show also follows Ciri, a young princess with mysterious powers who is on the run from a rival kingdom, and Yennefer, a fiercely independent sorceress with grand ambitions. Viewers follow along as their three paths inevitably intertwine. But instead of the serialized approach favored by prestige television, for much of its runtime , has more of a “creature of the week” structure. (This changes in the final two episodes as the season rushes towards a conclusion that very clearly sets up the second season.),Each episode — many of which are based explicitly on short stories from the books — tasks Geralt with solving a different monster-related problem, whether that’s a princess turned into a beast, or a vengeful djinn who has cursed his best friend, the bard Dandelion (who primarily goes by Jaskier in the show). The structure feels true to the spirit of the series, while also making it work well for television.,It also means that the show demands a bit more from viewers. Events in , don’t always unfold in chronological order, and there’s no explicit indication of whether you’re watching a scene in the past or present. Instead, you have to sort out the timing based on contextual clues: a line about an event you’ve already seen, or how close two characters have become. (Figuring out the timing isn’t helped by the fact that witchers and sorcerers barely age.) It took me a few episodes to get a solid sense of things. This also means , benefits from repeat viewings, where you can pick up on small details you may have missed the first time.,The most important part of ,, though, is Geralt himself. I’ll admit: I was nervous after seeing the initial photos of Henry Cavill in a Party City-esque white wig, but he absolutely nails the role. His Geralt is the exact right blend of scary, sexy, and sarcastic. Even his gravelly voice is perfect. The wig may look strange at times, but ultimately it doesn’t distract from what makes Geralt interesting. You even get to see him in multiple ,.,As a TV show, , is particularly refreshing in an era full of nihilistic fantasy stories inspired by ,. Yes, the show gets brutal at times. The wonderfully choreographed fight scenes are extremely violent, as is one very particular and hard-to-watch magical transformation. It’s a show where — shock! — the bad guys are usually humans, not monsters. What makes , feel different, though, is in the details. These stories aren’t full of people being awful for the sake of it; they’re making choices based on love or survival, and then things go wrong. What makes , so compelling is how it delves into these gray areas, exploring why people do what they do. By the end, you’ll have some measure of sympathy for almost everyone, no matter how irredeemable they might seem at first.,Crucially, , has a sense of humor. It’s not all dark and dire. Jaskier (Joey Batey) frequently plays the comedy relief, following Geralt around despite not being welcome, in order to turn Geralt’s exploits into song, sometimes breaking the fourth wall in the process. “There I go again,” he says at one point, “just delivering exposition.” When he meets the witcher for the first time, the bard tells him “I love the way you just sit in a corner and brood.” Meanwhile, Geralt’s quietly sarcastic nature is on full display. He can cut through any situation, no matter how awkward or horrible, with a frustrated “fuck.” And one of the show’s most dramatic sex scenes is accompanied by a playful jig and gawking onlookers making jokes.,could’ve very easily turned out wrong. It’s not hard to misinterpret what it is that actually makes the series interesting, but the TV adaptation gets it. ,is funny, intense, and uncomfortable, and it balances out those disparate emotions almost perfectly. Yes, it stars Henry Cavill in a bad white wig, but you’ll forget about all of that as soon as he starts talking."

Maybe it was the deep world-building that enticed you or all of the monster-hunting. Maybe it was Henry Cavill’s piercing yellow eyes. Either way, you’re in luck: you don’t have to wait for the second season to get more of Geralt. ,is based on a series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which also spawned a series of video games from CD Projekt Red so there is already a lot of , in the world to dive into. If you’re brand-new to the series, here are the best places to start.,The obvious place to start would be the very first , novel, ,, which,kicks off a lengthy storyline that spans six books. But if you’re coming to the books from the TV show, I’d recommend first delving into the short story collections, which predate the novels. There are two of them — , and ,— and both feature tales that form the basis for many of the show’s best episodes. The episode “Rare Species,” for instance, is based on the story “The Bounds of Reason” from ,, while the disturbing story “The Witcher” in , is the core of the episode “The Betrayer Moon.”,There are differences between the books and the show, of course. The Netflix series also weaves in an overarching story about warring kingdoms and the importance of destiny, which is largely absent from the short stories. But the two complement each other well, and they follow a similar structure, jumping back and forth in time with reckless abandon. In my opinion at least, , is at its best in this more standalone format, with Geralt investigating a new monster-related tragedy in each story. These two books will give you plenty of that.,You might be tempted to start from the beginning when it comes to the games. But I’d recommend sticking with the most recent entry in the series. Unlike books, games tend to age poorly, and this is particularly true for RPGs where quality-of-life updates can make older titles a chore to play through. But 2015’s , still feels fantastic today, and it’s the best — and most ambitious — entry in the series. It shifts things toward an open-world structure, and it’s filled with the same morally complex storytelling that makes the TV show so compelling. The two don’t cross over much, though; Netflix’s , is explicitly based on the books. And despite the three in the title, you don’t need to play the previous games to understand what’s going on.,Now is also the best time to play ,. For one thing, the game received two massive expansions, so if you’re just starting, you have , of video game in front of you. (The main story lasts dozens of hours on its own.) But it’s also very accessible. It’s available on a huge range of platforms, and it’s frequently on sale. Just yesterday, ,launched on Xbox Game Pass, making it free for subscribers to play. It’s even on the Nintendo Switch. While the Switch version suffers from a technical standpoint — the graphics and performance both take a hit on the smaller screen — much like , and other open-world games, , benefits greatly from being playable on the go where you can sneak in a quest or two in otherwise idle periods of time."
Galavant was the decade’s most underrated show that no one watched,"

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"“,” ,So begins the tale of ,, , that ran in 2015 and (somehow) returned for an even longer second season the following year.,On the surface, it’s a generic send-off of the fantasy genre that plays like a watered down version of , (with a little less heart and a little more snark). But , has a trick up its sleeve — it’s also a musical, a song-and-dance affair like a live-action Disney movie of old. , like a Disney movie, in fact, given that the songs were all written by the legendary Alan Menken (,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,) and co-collaborator Glenn Slater. ,The show starts by setting up a classic fairy-tale story in its , — Galavant is a gallant knight, riding to save his beloved Madalena from the clutches wicked King Richard — and then promptly blows the entire premise to bits. ,What follows are a few hours of fantasy-fueled musical comedy. There are jousts. There are sword fights. There are a variety of guest cameos. And of course, there are lot of enjoyable tunes, which range from clever to impossible to get out of your head. ,The cast is great, too: Joshua Sasse plays the titular hero, given equal opportunities to flex his golden pipes and biceps; Karen David is the iron-willed Princess Isabella, and Mallory Jansen is Galavant’s trope-dodging lost love Madalena. But the standout is Timothy Omundson’s King Richard, the initial antagonist who steals the show as a blustering, bumbling dictator with a heart of gold (and a truly magnificent beard). It helps that nearly all of the main cast can actually sing well, which means that there’s less of the awkwardness and auto-tuning typical of a Very Special Musical Episode from most shows. ,It’s not deep, but it’s deeply fun, especially if you (like me) particularly enjoy Disney renaissance movies and stage musicals. Thanks to its very unpopular nature, , is also extremely short, the kind of thing you can easily binge on a weekend when it’s too cold to go outside. To say that almost no one watched the first season of the show is an understatement — it was one of ABC’s worst shows that year — and despite a cliffhanger ending, it seemed like , was doomed to be nothing more than an easily missed blip on ABC’s schedule. ,Except, for some reason, it wasn’t. ABC gave the show a “miracle” renewal for a second season, and , delivered one of the most satisfying sequels of the decade. Season 2 takes everything further: more songs, more episodes, more off-kilter fairy-tale wackiness. The first episode, titled “A New Season ... aka Suck It Cancellation Bear” (a reference to ,) starts with a song that sees the , and features a shameless appeal to viewers to watch , instead of football, the Golden Globes, or , ,. The second season also adds more fantasy elements and specific parodies of stage musicals (including , and ,), as icing on the cake. ,ABC also took a page out the book of the far more popular ,, releasing songs individually on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube in the hopes that social media buzz might help lead to more success for the series. It also means that all the music is available to listen to, which you will mostly likely want to do after watching ,.  ,That the show even got renewed at all is a wild story. , was announced as part of ABC’s lineup in 2014, before being consigned to the mid-season break as filler for , Sunday night slot. (ABC had so little faith in the series that the eight-episode season was actually condensed into four weeks, with two episodes airing each Sunday). As expected, ratings were dismal, with the adorable musical comedy series being utterly crushed by ABC’s generally poor viewership, playoff football games, and award shows like the Golden Globes. A cancellation was all but guaranteed — except that ,was a favorite of then-ABC president Paul Lee, who ordered a second season against all odds (and against all common sense, if we’re being totally honest).,’s renewal — along with another season for the also poorly performing Marvel spinoff , — was part of Lee’s strategy to create “sticky” content that bet more on building brands with long-term cultural staying power over immediate rating success. This bet would spectacularly fail — ,, both ,and ,swiftly returned to lose half of their already poor audiences, and Lee was soon ousted and replaced by Channing Dungey. ,Lee’s ideas (and ,) might have just been a little ahead of its time; today’s streaming era puts a far bigger emphasis on word-of-mouth success and cultural mindshare than it does hard numbers about who’s watching. It’s easy to imagine a world where , was released as a streaming exclusive on something like Disney+ or Netflix, where its niche appeal could better shine outside of the harsh landscape of traditional network television. ,In the golden age of television the last decade has given us, it’s hard to say that , is a , show.

"Netflix’s stalker thriller You returns for a second season, and it kills","
          Dec 23, 2019,  9:00am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Perhaps the most deliciously satisfying thing about ,is that it began as a Lifetime show. It seemed to fit right in, too — based on the novel of the same name by Caroline Kepnes, the show followed bookseller Joe Goldberg as he began to stalk a woman named Beck, gradually inserting himself more and more into her life as he attempted to woo her and isolate her from all her friends. You know. Lifetime stuff. ,After a killer-but-little-watched first season, the show migrated to Netflix, where it will maybe find the audience it deserves — and yes, it does deserve it. Because ,masquerades as trashy thriller in order to get you to underestimate it — dismiss it, even — while it goes to work subverting every assumption you had about it. It’s a trick that doesn’t seem repeatable, but in ,’s second season, out December 26th, the show somehow pulls it off.,The second season of , is a bit of a reset. ,’s first season was fairly conclusive (I’ll be vague to preserve the fun for those who haven’t seen it), so in its second season, Joe — trying to start over after the first season’s events in New York — moves to LA, a place he hates, but also a place no one knows him. ,After briefly entertaining the notion of being a changed man who has left his stalking ways behind, Joe quickly falls into his old patterns. This time, his obsession is a woman named Love, his coworker at the hybrid wellness store / bookshop Anavrin. (Spell it backward and groan with me.),At first, it seems like , is simply repeating itself, playing the same beats with a different woman in Joe’s sights. To a certain extent, that’s true — there’s even a running subplot about a troubled woman who lives next door with a plucky kid Joe becomes protective of, a mirror image of season 1 — but as the twists pile up, the reflection comes across as intentional and effective. And it’s not like there aren’t new things happening here. Love’s codependent relationship with her brother takes , into some unexpected places, and the show’s new setting gives it new arenas for exploring toxic masculinity. There’s also some leftover threads from last season that turn the pressure up. And finally, harkening back to a similar moment in season 1, when the show finally breaks free of Joe’s perspective to let the audience in on Love’s side of the story, things , take a turn. ,What makes , subversive, brilliant television is delightfully simple: Joe is an idiot. Sure, he reads a lot of books and, as an observer of people, is pretty deft at manipulating the fundamental selfishness of others. But as a criminal? He’s hilariously incompetent. This is where , twists the knife you never knew it slipped in, because the point of the show is that he doesn’t , to be good at any of this. , makes it easy to condemn Joe because we are privy to his private moments and thoughts, the ways he justifies every overreach and horrible action. But to everyone else? He’s just a man, standing in front of a girl, patiently waiting for her to love him. He benefits from decades of cultural attitudes that have worn away at the agency of women, of romance tropes that valorize the persistence of men in pursuit of a woman, and the gendered head games that give men the upper hand in most every interaction they have. ,It does all this while also being extremely fun pulp nonsense, which somehow makes it feel ,dangerous. Throughout it all, Joe Goldberg is… funny? Sharp? And, thanks to Penn Badgley, perhaps the best voiceover narrator you’ve ever heard? You , Joe, and, because of a combination of Badgley’s performance and the incredible savvy of every member of the crew that points a camera or light at him, you frequently suffer whiplash for liking him, as he goes from charming book nerd to sardonic lead to super creep in the same shot. ,What we call prestige television is often a function of marketing. Prestige shows — the kind of stuff you see on HBO and sweeping the Emmys — involves a lot of putting on airs, signaling an intent to be literary or ambitious. , does no such thing. It is every inch the Lifetime show it began as, and just as wickedly sharp or thoughtful as another show with loftier goals. This makes , feel dangerous. Like it shouldn’t work so well. And then, when you start to think about why it does — well then, the show has you."

When , was released, the film’s biggest plot twist was hidden within a misleading video titled something like “LMAO funny Madden 16 glitches.” (Needless to say, there were no funny , glitches to be found.),Of course, the most logical suggestion for avoiding them is to simply log off indefinitely, but that’s probably not going to happen.,There are several ways to remain spoiler-free without curtailing your computer or phone use.

        ",Aliya Chaudhry,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge is having a great year. Fresh off the second season of her acclaimed show ,, the writer / actor / producer inked a blockbuster , in September. She’s emerged at the end of 2019 as one of the biggest names in TV, having worked on the script for the upcoming James Bond film, started on a brand-new HBO show, hosted Saturday Night Live, and won big at the Emmys for ,, in which Waller-Bridge plays the title character, is based on a play she wrote and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2013. Season 1 premiered in 2016, but the show practically went viral when the second season came out this summer. It was praised from start to finish for its brilliance and charm. The confessional, fourth-wall-breaking comedic drama centers on a woman navigating her life through personal relationships, crises, and tragedy, sandwiched between truly genius twists along the way. , isn’t just good writing and storytelling — it’s a show that resonates and connects with its audience. It can be painfully embarrassing at times, yet still irresistible to watch. And even at its most hyperbolic and cringeworthy moments, it still manages to feel real. It’s unflinching and fearless in its honesty and willingness to show Fleabag’s vulnerability. It’s funny, it’s heartbreaking, it’s layered, it’s raw, it’s genuine. ,One of Waller-Bridge’s big moments came during , where ,won for Outstanding Comedy Series, and Waller-Bridge won for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

It was a change for the comedy writer, but she turned out to be the right fit for the series. Waller-Bridge brilliantly infused its first season with humor — something else that’s often lacking in the genre.

Waller-Bridge’s deal is a win for Amazon, having snagged one of the biggest and brightest names in television right now. ,Her rise was monumental in a decade where there have been increasing conversations surrounding representation in film and TV. There are few female writers and producers that can be called household names, yet Waller-Bridge achieved success on such a large scale and with projects that centered a diverse group of women. These shows allowed female characters to be flawed and vulnerable — showed them as real, three-dimensional people — giving us some of the most fully realized depictions of women on-screen.,And she’s set up for even bigger projects in the next decade.

The Witcher’s success is held back by Netflix’s release strategy in a post-Game of Thrones world  ,"
          Dec 31, 2019,  9:00am EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg," has everything it needs to be Netflix’s next success: popular source material, a massive marketing campaign, a well-received performance by Henry Cavill, and an iconic meme in the form of , Yet, while certainly popular, it doesn’t seem like , is going to become “must see” television like other recent hits, such as , on Disney+ or , on HBO. At least part of the reason why is how Netflix released it: in a single, all-you-can-eat drop — like almost all of its other shows — instead of a more traditional weekly rollout.,Weekly releases have numerous benefits for fans: continued and focused conversation every week around the latest episode, a chance to digest and process events, and fewer demands on viewers’ time upfront. ,By dropping every episode at once, Netflix is sacrificing weekly discussions around , for a short burst of popularity, after which it trickles off into the void as people’s attentions are quickly grabbed by the next big thing. That extra time between episodes would let viewership build over time, as more people hear about the show or proselytize it to their friends.,Compare that to a weekly release, like ,, which captured a burst of attention with each new Baby Yoda GIF, or the weeklong discussions and theorizing that would fill the time between episodes of ,. Not everyone may have been on board with , at first, but when everyone else on the internet started talking about it and sharing GIFs, they may have been willing to give it a shot. ,Weekly releases (at reasonable hours) also transform streaming shows into the kind of appointment television that viewers flock to and watch together, reacting in real time. The weekly release schedule means everyone is roughly at the same place in the series; for the most part, no one is confused about why the song from the bard is a big deal because they haven’t gotten up to that episode yet. ,A weekly release also makes it less of a slog to actually watch a show. Give someone one episode, with the promise of more, and you’ve given them something to look forward to without demanding too much time upfront. Netflix dumps hours of content on viewers at once, demanding that they watch it all in a binge session that the site used to be famous for.,It’s not that , isn’t popular, either: at least one data firm says it’s more popular than ,at least for its first weekend debut, ,. But even if that number is correct, it’s just a single week, compared to the months that , dominated the conversation. How long can , keep that success going with no new episodes to drive viewers back and plenty of other new content waiting in their queues?,None of this is to say that Netflix’s traditional “dump it all in a single day” strategy isn’t always effective. Some of its original series — the three seasons of ,for example, ,, or any of the various Marvel shows it used to make — are filmed and designed as what amounts to a single 10-or-so-hour-long movie that just happens to have convenient episode breaks. While weekly releases still might make more sense, at least from a mindshare perspective, the release strategy there is at least understandable given the nature of the content. ,There was a time when Netflix’s approach was seen as a breath of fresh air, especially compared to the bloated, 24-episode and months-long seasons that dominated traditional broadcast. Netflix’s strategy killed the cruft, and promised an almost cinematic-like experience where the entire show hit at once. But hours-long TV show seasons aren’t movies, and trying to force episodic stories into a cinematic box just doesn’t work. ,Even among Netflix’s shows, though, , in particular feels designed for a weekly release, given the literal “monster-of-the-week” style plotting that (at least for part of the season) sees Geralt go somewhere and fight something in fairly self-contained chunks. Add in the , and developing storylines, and you’ve got a show that’s almost tailor-made for today’s ,/ ,/ ,-style cottage industry that loves to theorize and debate over shows. It’s hard to have a , podcast series, for example, when all the discussion happens over the course of a weekend. , style juggernauts are few and far between, even as more and more companies try to hit whatever magic combination of popularity and quality makes a show so hyped. Not every show will be the next , or , — take Apple TV Plus’ ,, which had a weekly release, huge budget, and star-studded cast but still flopped by virtue of not being very good. , probably won’t be the next ,It’s probable that no show ever will be: the success of , looks increasingly like a once-in-a-generation type of occasion. But Netflix’s release strategy isn’t giving its best shows the chance to even try, with the service choosing to burn off all its content in a single shot instead of a slower burn that could see it rise to greater heights.

"Netflix blew the release for ‘Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,’ the hit song of the season","
          Dec 30, 2019, 12:02pm EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"Netflix’s , adaptation seems to be the streaming service’s latest hit, helped at least in part by the massive viral success of the hit song of the season, “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,” sung by the bard Jaskier (Joey Batey) at the end of the show’s second episode to immortalize the epic deeds of Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill). ,But there’s one huge issue with “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher” (other than the fact that it will get stuck in your head seemingly forever): Netflix hasn’t released it (or any of ,’s soundtrack) for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, or any other major streaming or music purchasing service. ,The only semi-official release of the song, in fact, comes not from Netflix, but from a post from Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli — the composers for ,’s,soundtrack — ,. The post itself has nearly half a million views, which is certainly impressive, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions of plays it has across channels on YouTube — plays that could be going toward an official Netflix release on Spotify or Apple Music (or at the very least, with an official YouTube post from Netflix that links viewers to ,).,It’s not like Netflix couldn’t have seen this coming. ,, Batey commented that, “It’s the most annoying thing I’ve ever heard. It’s so catchy,Later in the interview, Batey elaborated that the song has stuck with him for months, compared to the scant week the rest of the world has had with it. “Everyone’s been listening to it for a week or so now, and humming it. I’ve had that in my head for eight months.” ,In other words, there’s no way that the folks over at Netflix couldn’t be aware that “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher” wasn’t going to blow up. , from Belousova, an official soundtrack release for , is theoretically ready to go, assuming Netflix decides to release it at all. “We have the soundtrack ready to go and can’t wait to get it out, however there’s no ETA at the moment since it is up to Netflix whether or not to make it happen.”,Compare that strategy to shows like ,, which has had official soundtrack releases for its popular songs (like ,) ready to stream just hours after the episodes aired. This kind of brand awareness isn’t a new idea for musically inclined TV shows, either. Series like ,, ,, and , have all experienced the benefits of having songs ready to stream — and potentially go viral across the internet — immediately. Netflix itself has seen the power of having potentially popular songs ready to go: the recently released comedy special , , and , the day it came out, as have plenty of other series (like ,). ,And even if one wanted to argue that there’s no demand for a full , soundtrack, Netflix could have still had just a single ready to drop for “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher” — a move the company has recently used for the original film , and ,. ,It’s possible all this is simply temporary, and Netflix is planning a big release for a, soundtrack down the line. But even if the company does have one in the works, it’ll have missed the viral moment around the song — and there’s no way it’ll be able to recover that."

Movies are already disappearing from Disney+,"
          Jan  2, 2020,  7:42pm EST
        ",Jay Peters,"Disney+ just launched in November, but some movies are already disappearing from the service, ,. For example, the three , movies were available ,, but the first , and , were removed from Disney+ yesterday, the first day of the new year.,Movies going away from Disney+ , goes against the idea you might’ve had that it would be the place you could find everything Disney-related forevermore. (And you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking that — in November, Disney did , that it, unlike some other services, wouldn’t have a “rotating slate” of licensed movies each month.) But that doesn’t exactly appear to be true, given that some movies have already been removed from the service, less than two months after launch.,Why? My colleague , that these removals are due to issues with legacy licensing deals:,The removals also came as something of a surprise, since Disney didn’t say that they would be leaving the service before pulling them. Content coming and going from streaming services is a reality most consumers are used to at this point, but other streaming services like Netflix and Hulu will at least announce what content is coming and going from their services on a monthly basis. ,It’s unclear when ,, ,, or any of the movies that have already been removed may return to the service, although Disney says it’ll happen at some point. And other movies may also disappear from Disney+ in the future, as , there’s a chance that huge Disney movies like ,and ,, among other late-decade titles,,will return to Netflix starting “around 2026.” That suggests they wouldn’t be available on Disney+ that year — if Disney and Netflix’s current deal stands. But there’s always a chance the company could make a new deal with Netflix — like when it , with Starz to get ,on Disney+ at launch.,What this all means for the future is that Disney+ probably won’t ever have every Disney-owned movie at any one given time, and you can’t necessarily expect anything added to the service to stay forever. Until new and different deals are inked (if they ever are), if you see a movie you want to watch on Disney+, you might want to watch it as soon as you can. "

BoJack Horseman is its own harshest critic,"
          Oct 29, 2019, 10:54am EDT
        ",Jack Godwin,"Few of the viewers tuning into Netflix’s animated series , in 2014 could have anticipated how the series would evolve over the course of its six seasons to date. What began as a pun-filled send-up of celebrity culture and the media circus, set in a world full of anthropomorphic animals, soon presented a nuanced take on mental illness and the cycles of trauma. Before long, series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg was turning this critical eye to his own perceived failings.,From the start, ,was always introspective and prone to putting its characters’ behavior under the microscope. But as the series progressed, the scrutiny became far more intense. Bob-Waksberg eventually turned the show toward examining its own cultural impact, even questioning his desire to self-evaluate. The sixth season, which launched on Netflix on October 25th, continues this pattern of criticism, as the series’s protagonist, depressed former sitcom star BoJack Horseman (Will Arnett) begins his own journey to recovery, interrogating his behavioral patterns and revisiting trauma sites. More so than any fan or commentator, the show holds the top spot as its own harshest critic.,BoJack longs for a life as simple as the one in his former hit sitcom,, where every conflict was resolved in one episode, so everything could reset again. From the beginning, the series made it clear that this fantasy was incompatible with reality, and that BoJack’s refusal to deal with his problems was only going to make things worse. Although Bob-Waksberg set out to subvert viewer expectations, this subversion soon became routine. One woman BoJack dates even highlights this trend by asking him to “do that BoJack thing where you make a big deal over nothing and everyone laughs at you but at the same time relates, because you’re saying all the things polite society won’t.”,For the first few seasons, the show has its cake and eats it, too. Bob-Waksberg mines ,’s sitcom status for all its absurd comedy, such as BoJack’s best friend Todd (Aaron Paul) landing himself in a “two-dates-to-the-prom” situation with rival prison gangs. At other times, the show emphasizes that life rarely fits this structure, such as when BoJack’s former friend and , creator Herb (Stanley Tucci) rejects BoJack’s heartfelt apology, even on his deathbed. The series brings in sitcom tropes and structure to mock them, but also to seriously reflect BoJack’s damaged psyche. ,But from the second season onward, the writers became increasingly aware of their complicity in the sitcom-reset fantasy, and they worked harder to keep their stories from growing stagnant. The show started taking BoJack’s bad behavior to darker corners with plots where he’s caught with a friend’s 17-year-old daughter and a reckless drug-fueled bender with Sarah Lynn (Kristen Schaal), a former ,child actress who had gotten clean and sober. In the season 4 episode “The Old Sugarman Place,” he demolishes his family home in an attempt to “move forward” and return to Los Angeles. This forceful return to the status quo also reflected BoJack’s cycle of delusion and entitlement, as well as his inability to pull himself free from the quagmire of depression.,Dealing with thorny topics like trauma, privilege, mental illness, harassment, and substance abuse isn’t easy, especially when they have to be balanced with animal puns and goofy antics. (“Viva Toddfoolery!”) The writers frequently use comedy to provide catharsis amid tension or tragedy, with Todd getting into a ,caper in the same episode where feminist writer Diane (Alison Brie) faces the fallout of speaking out on sexual misconduct. But the creative team eventually cornered themselves by calling out the incompatibility between real life and sitcom structure, given that they’d set up a scenario where they needed sitcom structure to tell their stories.,By the third season, the episodic cycles of BoJack’s toxic, damaging behavior ran the risk of becoming repetitive and predictable. But the writers acknowledged the problem, with Todd calling out BoJack in the season 3 episode “It’s You”: “You can’t keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself as if that makes it okay — you need to be better!”,This isn’t just Todd pushing back against a friend who is all too ready to be forgiven. It’s the writers examining the impact of their show. It’s one thing to derive comedy from BoJack’s misanthropy, but allowing it to go unchallenged sets a dangerous precedent. Rather than shying away from the question, the creative team wrestled with their purpose as the series progressed. When BoJack plays gritty anti-hero detective Philbert in season 5, Diane questions whether such ultra-dark characters have a negative influence on the viewer. By extension, she’s implicating BoJack’s role within ,, and his effect on the Netflix viewership.,In season 1’s penultimate episode, BoJack asks Diane whether he’s a good person, and she answers with crushing silence. While she later tries to explain that no one is truly good or bad, and that “all you are is just the things that you do,” he still seeks to purge himself of the guilt he feels. Following his toxic mantra, “There’s always more show,” and taking some damaging advice that he should “keep running forward, no matter what,” BoJack avoids confronting his problems and insists he isn’t going to change. He sees Philbert — who he and Diane both helped bring to the screen — as a role model, playing into Diane’s fear that Philbert allows “dumb assholes to rationalize their own awful behavior.”,BoJack explains in the season 5 episode “Head in the Clouds” that Philbert teaches “We’re all terrible, so we’re all okay.” Diane, who is already struggling with her part in creating the show, is horrified by this interpretation, and points out that normalizing and rationalizing harmful behavior is dangerous. During this conversation, the show reaches one of its darkest and most self-critical points by bringing up BoJack’s relationship with Sarah Lynn. She saw him as a father figure even into her adult life as a pop star, but that became complicated when their relationship later turned sexual.,“I’m the one who has suffered the most because of the actions of BoJack Horseman,” he argues. Diane raises his unquestionable negative effect on Sarah Lynn as proof he’s wrong. “That’s been really hard for you, the main character in this story,” she says sarcastically. In one of its most merciless scenes, the writers reflect on their choice to empathize with a character like BoJack. They also seem to lament how they initially played BoJack’s sexual encounter with Sarah Lynn as a gag, and questions the cultural norms they were reinforcing.,Diane isn’t free from criticism, either. She’s often the show’s moral arbiter and its voice of reason, but she subjects herself to severe scrutiny, representing the show’s impulse to endlessly dissect its characters. Diane suggests we should be “asking more of ourselves and the people in our lives,” but she’s told she should also find ways to forgive herself and other people. ,is constantly striving for that balance.,Part of Diane’s self-examination may be inspired by the controversy surrounding her casting. Diane is Vietnamese-American, but she’s played by Caucasian actress Alison Brie. After a fan brought up the issue ,, Bob-Waksberg , he’d “soured on the idea of ‘color-blind’ casting as an excuse to not pay attention.” He later gave a , where he expressed “tremendous guilt” over the casting, and said his “understanding of [his] own responsibility” had changed. The same humble and honest outlook on guilt and responsibility underlies much of the show, especially in its later seasons. It’s notable that season 6 takes the time to answer fan ,, a Caucasian character with a Latinx surname, as if leaving no stone unturned.,The newly released first half of season 6 takes BoJack to rehab, in a recovery process that isn’t just about dealing with addiction, but about questioning the realities of forgiveness and personal change. Even the new opening credits see him passing through past regrets that still linger and threaten his future. A frequent refrain of the show brings together BoJack, seeing himself as a “stupid piece of shit,” and Diane, seeing herself as a “rudderless garbage barge.” They’re both trying their best to forgive each other because they can’t extend that same courtesy to themselves., often explores questions of forgiveness, both between people and between stars and their fans. We may find it easier to forgive BoJack’s mistakes than the unrepentant misogyny Hank Hippopopalous (Philip Baker Hall) exhibits in “Hank After Dark,” but the series has long since outgrown any simple ideas of heroes and villains. Secondary characters like Mr. Peanut Butter and Princess Carolyn — who initially served as counterpoints to BoJack’s pessimism and immaturity, respectively — become deeply flawed characters in their own right. Meanwhile, loathsome antagonists like Vanessa Gekko and Rutabaga Rabitowitz were revealed as the protagonists of their own stories.,As the show heads toward its finale, it’s still exploring that question BoJack asks Diane in season 1: is he a good person at heart, or is it too late for him? The sixth season shows that change is possible for BoJack, as he begins to make amends for the things he’s done, face addiction, and try to forgive himself. The self-examination that has taken place both within the story and in the writing room has demonstrated a maturity capable of tackling such broad and complicated issues. Rather than providing simple platitudes, the series brings its characters together through empathy rather than sympathy, and honesty over blind faith. Being its own harshest critic has let , evolve, and be the best version of itself."

Sony is shutting down its live TV service PlayStation Vue in January 2020,"

        ",Nick Statt,"Sony is shutting down its live TV streaming service PlayStation Vue on January 30th, 2020, the ,. The sudden announcement of the shutdown comes just a week after a ,saying Sony was looking for a buyer for the service, which has continually lost money for the company since its launch in March of 2015. Sony has repeatedly raised the price of Vue to try to offset its rising costs, most recently ,. ,“Unfortunately, the highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected. Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business,” Sony said in a blog post announcing the shutdown. “PlayStation fans can continue to access movie and TV content through the PlayStation Store on PS4 and via our partnerships with top entertainment apps.”,PlayStation Vue launched four years ago as an early competitor in the so-called pay-TV market, which is a restructured form of cable made popular by companies like Sling. Like most other vendors, Sony offered a skinny bundle of channels with the option to add more premium ones, like sports and entertainment channels, by paying a higher monthly subscription fee. After the price hike, the entry-level Vue plan cost about $50 a month. At its height, Vue amassed about 500,000 subscribers, which is far less than competitors like Sling and YouTube TV, , reported last week. ,Ultimately, it looks like Sony couldn’t make the economics work, as the cost of licensing cable channels far outweighed the money Sony could recoup on subscriptions. Vue’s demise is also a signal that customer interest in traditional cable bundles, skinny or otherwise, continues to shrink. As a result, major players in the entertainment industry are , to compete with Amazon and Netflix. That includes Disney with Disney+, Apple with Apple TV Plus, AT&T with HBO Max, and NBCUniversal with Peacock, among others. "

That’s why HBO’s , something the company rolled out earlier this year, is getting a big lift on ,. Celebrities will now have pages where they can list their own recommendations. HBO Max customers can then use those recommendation pages to select a movie or TV show directly from that celebrity’s profile. ,A new function, called “highlight,” is designed to help people not have to worry about scrolling through an app to choose something to watch. Users spend about nine minutes just scrolling through options, and HBO Max is designed to cut through that. Highlights, as seen in the photo below, are curated and packaged together to offer subscribers more specific choices. For example, ,has highlight packages based on celebrity cameos, in case customers specifically want to watch the Brad Pitt episode again. ,HBO Max will also offer a shared viewing experience, one where you can create a combined shared account with other people you watch with, to improve the kind of recommendations each of you might individually see. With other streaming services, sharing an account can often lead to strange recommendations; HBO says it added the feature because of those concerns.,HBO Max will offer podcasts based on certain shows (HBO’s ,). These podcasts will exist on the app, and can be listened to on the go. Those podcasts will also lead to suggested recommendations based on the show the podcast talks about. ,Executives at the company spoke about how integral having an easy-to-use interface and clean look will be to HBO Max’s success. Netflix initially set the tone for what a streaming service should look and feel like, although , and , have offered their own unique takes on laying out its titles since. , during the company’s biennial D23 fan convention in Anaheim and noticed that while it was elegant and sleep, it also felt empty. We wrote at the time:,Apple TV+ doesn’t have the same catalogue of films and TV shows that HBO Max and Disney+ will launch with, so it’s instead ,, but HBO Max is launching with more than 10,000 titles, including Max Originals, past WarnerMedia titles, and licensed series like the entire ,catalogue and the Studio Ghibli collection of animated films. ,HBO’s new streaming service is aiming to have half of its programming targeted at young millennials, and the other half split between family entertainment and series targeted at adults. ,HBO Max will launch in 2020."

It’s the one where Jason Momoa’s character picks up a book for the first time. Since the show is set centuries after a virus deprived humanity of sight, he has no idea what’s in his hands. He complains it smells like “dead bark” and holds it the way a toddler might hold a vegetable when they were in fact expecting a cookie. Then Alfre Woodard’s character demands he hand over what he’s found, and speaks its long-forgotten name: ,.,It’s extremely funny in context, and probably debilitating out of it. It also makes ,, Apple’s post-apocalyptic drama, one of my favorite kinds of shows: you could just plainly state something that happens in an episode, and everyone would swear you’re making it up. That doesn’t mean you should watch it. ,Set in the ruins of our world, the people of , have adjusted to a sightless life after centuries of practice. Makeshift curtains of beads make for boundaries both audible and physical, fights involve a lot of probing contact and grappling (as does sex), and there’s a lot of finger snapping. , is extremely invested in showing you how all this stuff works, so much so that it barely delves into its characters. ,Baba Voss (Jason Momoa) is a man who must take his family on the run after his adopted twins, Kofune and Haniwa, are born with sight. The trouble is, the very idea of sight is heretical — much like witchcraft in colonial America, troublesome people are accused of having the ability to see as justification for burning them alive. And there’s also an evil queen who learns of the twins, and as a religious zealot who worships the “darkness” (by, and I will testify to this in court if I have to, masturbating as she prays) she wants them brought to her for evil queen reasons. ,A generous and forgiving read of , could interpret it as an attempted meditation on knowledge, ignorance, and responsibility, but ,actively resists attempts to latch on to anything of substance it might have to offer. In the first three episodes made available in advance to critics, , is more interested in the logistics of its world than it is in implications. ,Sometimes that leads to fun television. The third episode, the best of that initial bunch, is largely unconcerned with the season’s main arc, instead telling a story where Kofune is kidnapped by slavers and must be rescued. It’s visually striking, introducing a tribe of people that, unbeknownst to them, are living in the ruins of an amusement park. It’s got a killer fight scene, with unique choreography that clearly conveys the limitations and skills of everyone involved and depicts brutal violence with grace and skill. And it’s got personal stakes, which I won’t spoil here because it’s one of the only bits of character backstory you get in the first couple of episodes. ,None of these things make , a more interesting show beyond the hour you spend watching them. It’s cotton candy, a fun confection for one moment, and just plain sugar the next. , is clearly interested in drawing people into its elaborate and well-crafted post-apocalypse, but it’s telling that the only questions I have after watching are purely pedantic ones. Like how did a blind society make such perfect and deadly weapons, or build homes that never leak, or clothes and makeup that look so nice? ,These are questions asked by jerks and spoilsports, and I wish I had better ones to ask of ,. The show is strange, but fails to justify that strangeness with a compelling story, characters, or literally anything other than the list of ideas you and your stoned cousin would come up with if you wondered what it would be like if we all woke up one day totally blind, man. Maybe you’ll come up with something fun enough for posting on Twitter, but it’s not going to cut it for eight hours of television."

        ",Julia Alexander,"If ,is , crown-jewel prestige drama and ,is its bet on sci-fi programming, , is its most fun. Circumventing Apple’s idea of what a prestigious show should look like brings some much needed carefreeness to the streaming platform.  ,The show finds Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld) in the 1850s as she struggles to follow her dreams of becoming a poet at a time when female writers were frowned upon. Her father Edward (Toby Huss) sours at the idea of people in Massachusetts finding out she’s a writer, afraid of the shame she’ll bring to their family. Only two people support her ambitious desires: George Gould (Samuel Farnsworth), a local literary magazine editor who also wants to marry Emily, and Sue Gilbert (Ella Hunt), her best friend turned secret lover.,Using period-accurate costumes and sets gives it a slightly prestigious feel, but the dialogue is deliberately contemporary. Characters speak to one another like they’re living in modern times, cursing at each other and saying things like, “What up, girl?” Though ,feels like it’s nearing disaster at times, the show’s best moments come when it leans into its own absurdity: when a science experiment is used to simulate an orgasm, or a house party devolves into maelstrom as underage teens mess around with opioids, twerking to pulsating trap music.,doesn’t have the boundary-pushing ,, HBO’s popular teen drama that aired over the summer, but it’s unabashed in its admiration for youth culture. Teens in ,are unapologetically teens. Relationships are intoxicating, self-discovery is angst-ridden, and the future is full of endless possibilities built on beautifully reckless dreams only teenagers can have.,Emily Dickinson’s poems are obsessed with youthful themes: fame, popularity, intense bouts of emotion and, of course, a fetishization of death. Her work isn’t changed in ,. The stanzas are true to the source material. Modernizing the way characters speak to each other, but keeping the poems consistent, allows Dickinson’s words to feel more approachable for an audience that came into their own by way of Lil Peep Instagram live-streams and SoundCloud emo rap.,Most brilliantly, ,isn’t trying to be a teen show. That’s precisely why it works as one. It kind of stumbles into itself, finding its footing along the way. There isn’t any clear direction or structure to help it stay on the same path. ,doesn’t shy away from ludicrousness, but leans into it unabashedly. It’s an “unapologetic, crying on the floor at two in the morning, flirting with the fetishization of death even when floating on the undeniable highness of life” type of disaster. ,That’s especially true when it comes to Emily’s forbidden relationship with Sue. Steinfeld and Hunt charm whenever they’re on-screen together, excellent at playing up grandeur expressions of their love for each other while putting just as much importance into the small gestures that cement their relationship. They’re giddy when with each other, full of sneaky kisses and uncontrollable giggles that define first loves.,Although their relationship is forbidden, made harder by Sue’s engagement to Emily’s brother, Austin (Adrian Enscoe), it’s never tragic. Their obsession with each other is all-encompassing. Everything is carefree and in the moment. It’s not fraught with drama or cocooned in sadness the way other queer relationships on TV can be, especially with younger characters. Emily is upset by Sue’s engagement, but even that isn’t enough to drive them apart. They simply exist, together, now.,is so unafraid of being itself that I found myself enamored by it, flaws and all, by the middle of the first episode. It’s one of the only Apple TV Plus shows that I wanted to revisit after watching the first three episodes provided to critics.

        ",Kevin Nguyen,"In Ronan Farrow’s book ,, which details how the former NBC News correspondent pieced together his Pulitzer-winning reporting about Harvey Weinstein, the first menacing figure we meet isn’t actually Weinstein. It’s Matt Lauer. Farrow’s reporting took place (about a year) before allegations of sexual assault would be leveled against the venerable ,anchor. At the beginning of ,, Farrow details a meeting he had with Lauer, one of the few people at NBC supportive of the Weinstein story. Feeling reassured by the encouragement of the network’s biggest figure, Farrow leaves Lauer’s office, and notices a peculiar thing: a button under the desk that closes the door behind him.,, the mega-expensive prestige drama launching on Apple TV Plus, imagines the aftermath of a beloved anchor felled by the revelations of his sexual misconduct. The allegations are not as severe as Lauer’s — the show , its audience all sex was consensual — but it’s hard not to see him in the character of Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), repeatedly referred to as the “dad” of morning news and donning a name that even sounds like a bizarro-universe Matt Lauer.,It is not Kessler but his co-host Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) who has to deal with the fallout immediately. They’ve been on , together for nearly two decades — the mom and dad of America for a program with the tagline “Start your day with your family”— and Alex scrambles to figure out how to address the news of her fired co-host, and who will replace him. To further matters, Alex is deeply concerned about her own contract with the show being renewed, which makes you wonder if the most important question here is whether she can keep her job., is a confounding series full of actors you like, none of whom seem particularly thrilled to be there. In addition to Carell and Aniston, Reese Witherspoon plays Bradley Jackson, a small-time news anchor with the least convincing southern accent I’ve heard since Cindy in ,. A clip of her screaming at a coal protest goes viral, and through a series of bewildering decisions by Alex and her boss, Bradley is suddenly in the running to replace Mitch.,Mitch, by the way, is far from cast off in the show. ,explores how one might wrestle with the repercussions of being Me Too’d. That turns out to be little more complicated than watching Carell bash a flat screen TV out of anger, and then later, unbelievably, tell an old colleague, “At first they came for the rapists, and I said nothing.” That’s probably the nadir of ,’s writing, the rest of it largely — if not clumsily — functional, but Carell does himself no favors by confusing awkward yelling with compelling acting. (In fact, his tantrums are not far off from his character in ,.) ,The only actor on , who seems to be having any fun is Billy Crudup as Cory Ellison, a caricature of a network exec. Still, he moves through the show effortlessly with a smarmy charm (schmarm?), even though his motivations are more inscrutable than they are Machiavellian. At one point, Crudup shouts “chaos is the new cocaine,” and he almost gets away with it.,Most of the dialogue involves characters announcing how they feel. When they’re not, it sounds like they’re telling jokes without punchlines, like when Levy says, “People are idiots. Am I right?” At times, you can sense the show’s aspirations to be something of the Aaron Sorkin universe, except it possesses none of Sorkin’s strengths (the briskly paced chattiness; frequent levity) and most of his weaknesses (a privileged, navel-gazing sense of self-righteousness; the attempts at inclusion that end up feeling kind of racist). The show even looks deeply bland, which honestly might be the most refreshing non-decision in a world where every streaming show is basked in moody, saturated colors or attempts to evoke realism by shooting on handheld cameras.,Similarly, you could also describe the politics of , as glossy and uncomplicated. Predictably, the fight for journalism is basically divided between good, salt-of-the-earth folks like Bradley and greedy, cynical execs like Cory. At one point, the argument is so stark that Cory says, in all seriousness, “What we really need on television right now — it’s not news, or fucking journalism. It’s entertainment.” (Again, somehow Crudup sells this without batting an eye. Give this handsome man an Emmy!),Still, Jackson and Ellison’s dynamic is the show’s most intriguing one — a strength of on-screen chemistry — even if it is still situated in a very basic idea of an employee being real spunky with her boss. In fact, , constantly addresses the notion of power and who has it, but never seems interested in how or why. Network execs are powerful because they’re at the top. Anchors like Levy have power, too, because they’re famous and in front of cameras (though the show finds the most improbable ways for her to wield it). ,But for a series that wants to run at Me Too, it has little to no curiosity in how bad behavior is ignored, allegations are suppressed, or the people and institutions that keep it this way. Farrow’s book revealed the insidious and very deliberate ways men like Weinstein, Lauer, and Tom Brokaw could protect themselves through intimidation and NDAs. In ,, everyone is just too dang earnest, or really, too selfish to think about anyone but themselves.,Even the time we spend with Mitch, whose arc is unclear (though my hope is that it goes in the direction of “acceptance” rather than “redemption”), feels unearned. We get scenes like the one where he struggles to work the Keurig machine in his home. He gets frustrated, then furious, but eventually figures out how to operate the very simple coffee machine. And we’re supposed to feel… what exactly? It’s unclear. It seems fitting that , is the key launch title for Apple’s major foray into original content. This is a company that values simplicity, clarity, and loves smooth corners so much that they designed their headquarters to be completely without rough edges.,There are hints of promise, though. At the end of the third episode, the last that was screened in advance to critics, a producer, Mia Jordan (Karen Pittman), wanders into the now-vacant office of Mitch Kessler. She admires his things, gazes in the mirror, and locates a button under the desk. The door of the office closes. The short scene suddenly gives , a sense of menace and foreboding that had been missing for the previous three hours. Mia then goes to Levy’s office to confront her about how complicit she was in Mitch’s behavior. And suddenly , has its first interesting moment, because it finally wants things to be messy."

Over the course of seven seasons, the groundbreaking sitcom followed Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), an unmarried career woman working as a broadcast news producer at a Minneapolis TV station where the demands of the job regularly interfered with her personal life. In “Assistant Wanted, Female,” Mary’s boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner) allows her to hire some help, and she takes a chance on her snobbish, conceited neighbor Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman) who has a hard time taking orders from someone she considers her inferior.,Because , debuts on Apple TV Plus today.,Consumers will be inundated with new subscription streaming services over the next six months, with ,, ,, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock all launching soon, offering original programming alongside an impressive back catalog of classic television and movies. Apple TV Plus will be one of the least expensive of the streaming market’s major players, though, without a Disney- or HBO-like archive of highly valued older content, the company intends to lure subscribers solely with its own products. The service arrives today with a small handful of TV series in a variety of genres, from period dramas to kids’ shows.,The centerpiece of the Apple TV Plus first wave is ,. The backstage melodrama stars Jennifer Aniston as a veteran network TV news anchor who fights for her job and tussles with a new rival (Reese Witherspoon) when her longtime co-host (Steve Carell) is fired for sexual misconduct.

It also deals with how women are treated in show business in the #MeToo era., is hardly the first series to find drama and humor in the evolving roles for women in media. Beginning in 1970, , built a devoted audience with its sophisticated, funny take on the everyday grind of turning out a local news telecast — and with its depiction of the toll the job takes on one independent woman. Mary Richards had her share of romantic subplots during the run of the show, but the writers (including Silverman, one of the few women in the room) were far more interested in her friendships and in how she navigated a stressful, fast-paced workplace., was especially good at contrasting Mary with the other women in her life. “Assistant Wanted, Female” opens with her sharing breakfast with her best pal Rhoda, a wisecracking cynic, stressing out about her diet. (“Just a 70-calorie hard-boiled egg for ol’ tubbo,” Rhoda says of herself, before giving in to temptation and having toast with jam.) Both of them bristle at Phyllis, who swoops into Mary’s apartment looking well-dressed and perfectly coiffed, boasting about “being a model wife and a perfect mother.” (“She’s going to give overbearing, aggressive women a bad name,” Rhoda gripes.) As Mary strives to be taken seriously at work, she sees reflections of herself in her two friends: the one who gets on everyone’s nerves because she tries too hard and the one who stays primed for disappointment by treating everything as a joke.,Anyone interested in tracking the transitions women have experienced in the workplace, and in media, in particular.,“Assistant Wanted, Female” arrived early in ,’s run when Mary was still trying to find her bearings at the fictional Minneapolis station WJM. Without making a big point of it, the episode exposes the gendered power imbalance in the newsroom where Mary is expected to work through lunch, covering the phones and doing the filing, while news anchor Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) takes a long nap after a two-hour Mexican feast.,Most of the humor here comes from the way Mary manages two competing egos as she runs interference between the evening news’s sour, unsentimental producer Lou and the above-it-all Phyllis. Because she takes this job mostly as a lark, Phyllis has a lackadaisical attitude toward her clerical assignments and working hours. When Mary chastises her for embarrassing her in front of Mr. Grant, Phyllis assumes her friend is just jealous and wonders if she should’ve dressed more “dowdy,” so as not to overshadow Mary.

It also felt like fan service, letting people see how these characters and events turned out down the road.,Jumping from a very stylized 1970s / 80s to a sort of stylized 2019 is extremely weird, though. It’s like seeing a character from a Western pop up on a space ship — just completely and utterly out of place.,I’m sure that was part of the point, but combined with James Franco in old man makeup, the whole thing felt uproariously goofy. , has always tried to be so much bigger than it can handle (e.g. the final episode’s emotional climax took place during a surprise wedding for a couple who are at best tertiary characters), and jumping ahead to the present day was kind of the ultimate demonstration of that.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,I think motorcycle chases are probably just inherently cooler than car chases because the vehicles are more nimble and you can see the rider.

There are a lot of characters and a lot of plot lines weaving in and out of each other. It’s the kind of thing that a book or a TV series can do really well, devoting as much time as necessary to each story.

Apple TV Plus is basically free because Apple’s end game is replicating Amazon Prime,"
          Nov  1, 2019, 11:01am EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"Apple CEO Tim Cook offered a simple answer when investors asked why the company decided to essentially give away its upcoming streaming service, ,, for next to nothing: it’s a “gift to our users.”,“We’re really proud of the content,” Cook told investors ,. “We’d like as many people as possible to view it. And so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going.”,Apple TV Plus ,, but anyone who purchases a new or refurbished piece of Apple hardware will get a free one-year subscription. Those customers can then get five people on their Family Sharing plan. Maximizing subscribers is important to the company and to investors who are eager to figure out Apple’s strategy. ,This is a new space for the company, one it’s been trying to crack for years. All eyes are on whether TV Plus can take off or whether it will flop. Cook knows this, but he’s outlined ,. Creating an ecosystem of ongoing, subscriber-based products that keep customers within the company’s ecosystem is crucial. ,, and now Apple TV Plus exist to give people an avenue into the broader Apple ecosystem. That doesn’t include important ongoing hardware-based subscriptions iOS users pay for today, including iCloud storage and the company’s iPhone leasing program. Each service attracts its own paying subscribers, but there’s a future in which all of these services are bundled together to create a more unified customer base for Apple. ,The company is already experimenting with such bundles. Customers who ,. Eventually, Apple could spread that out to include Apple News Plus and Apple Arcade. Video is a “core part of this effort,” wrote Matthew Ball, an industry analyst and former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, ,analysis,last May.,“An Apple Subscription allows the company to use its existing ecosystem, reach and brand to de-risk new business, out-compete in undifferentiated ones and create a rich, proprietary experience that its competitors will struggle to match (due to either their more modest cash reserves or scope of services),” Ball added.,Just because Apple TV Plus is free now doesn’t mean it will stay that way. Customers pay for Amazon Prime Video; they just get it through Amazon Prime. They also get Amazon Music and one free Twitch Prime subscription every month. Apple wants to replicate Amazon’s success by using its big advantage: hardware. Once customers are reliant on Apple’s apps, upgrading to a new iPhone or MacBook makes even more sense. ,People are still spending money. It’s just likely that instead of spending $750 for a new iPhone or $150 for an Apple TV once and getting the service for free, they’ll pay $50, $75 or $100 a month for Apple services indefinitely."
The Mandalorian’s first episode shows that Star Wars can work on the small screen,"
          Nov 12, 2019, 10:03am EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg," has always been heavily inspired by classic Westerns. But that’s never been quite as overt as it is in ,, the first live-action TV series for the franchise and the marquee title for the brand-new , streaming service. Outside of a few animated TV shows aimed at kids, , has largely been a brand that has thrived on the big screen — the original films practically invented the modern concept of a summer blockbuster — but can it make the jump to a prestige TV drama?,With just a single episode out, it’s hard to say whether Disney has succeeded, but one thing is clear: , is off to a great start, and it’s perhaps the best proof yet that the , universe can lead to compelling content that isn’t packaged for kids or reliant on Luke Skywalker showing up. ,The first episode does a lot of heavy lifting to acclimate viewers to a part of the , universe that feels both familiar and new. There’s the eponymous Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), a bounty hunter not unlike the fan-favorite Boba Fett from the films. The Mandalorian is largely a blank slate; he’s mostly silent, always masked, but very good at what he does: hunting down and sometimes killing bail-jumpers and smugglers for money.,We get a crash course in how the bounty-hunting system works, complete with the Bounty Hunters Guild — a long-standing , concept — taken extremely literally as an actual unionized workforce of bounty hunters. There are labor disputes over clients refusing to pay guild rates. It is possibly the most relatable thing to occur in the episode. We also get a hint at the current state of the galaxy following the destruction of the second Death Star and the downfall of the Empire. It seems Imperial credits aren’t in demand, these days. ,There are very few overt references to the films so far. Unlike , and , (the first wave of spinoff films, which could, at times, feel smothering in their desire to explain and reference the main saga), , feels more like its own thing. There are plenty of , trappings, of course — droids and Stormtroopers and people frozen in carbonite abound — but the show feels less reliant on name-dropping events and fan service-y cameos than past elements. The heavily Western mood does suggest that Disney is learning from its blockbuster Marvel franchise, which has seen massive success by dropping the MCU formula and characters into different genres. Much like how , is designed in the vein of classic spy films or the , films are modeled after superheroic heists, , wears its influences proudly. It’s possible that this will change and the ghost of Darth Vader will show up in episode 3, flying the Millennium Falcon with Luke Skywalker. But for now, the show seems far more comfortable existing on its own than previous titles.,We also get the basic setup for the rest of the series. After a successful run of smaller bounty-hunting gigs, Carl Weathers’ Greef Carga, the local guild representative, puts the Mandalorian in touch with a mysterious client (Werner Herzog’s unnamed but clearly Empire-affiliated villain) who offers a far more difficult bounty on behalf of his associate, Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi). The reward? ,, or Mandalorian iron, an incredibly rare substance that’s used to make true Mandalorian armor, which can famously deflect blasters and even lightsaber attacks. It should go without saying that things do not go smoothly. ,Unlike , heroes past, including Harrison Ford’s charming Han Solo, Pedro Pascal’s Mandalorian is more of a quiet lone gunslinger in the vein of Clint Eastwood, speaking only when he needs to. There’s not a ton of depth, although there’s a clear establishment of the “heart of gold” trope, despite his grim profession. (At one point, he donates a portion of his earnings to support orphans.) There’s also a requisite tragic backstory that will no doubt be explored in future episodes. Pascal does good work, despite the restrictions of the masked role, playing the part with cool efficiency.,The show looks fantastic; Disney clearly spared no expense. Everything from the CGI for the spaceships and blasters to the elaborate sets and costumes feels right at home with the giant blockbusters that have made up the franchise so far. ,The big question remains whether , can keep up this momentum for the rest of the season and beyond. (The series has already been renewed for a second season.) The first season’s eight episodes are almost as long as an entire ,trilogy of movies, making the show one of the largest chunks of the constantly evolving live-action , canon.,Combined with the lackluster reception of previous spinoff attempts no doubt weighing heavily on Disney’s mind along with the upcoming end of the more reliable Skywalker Saga films with ,which is due out in December, , has to be more than just a good show. It has to carry the entire , franchise forward while also providing a reason for millions of people to pay a monthly price for Disney+.,The closest comparison I can think of is 2017’s ,, which similarly had to carry a long-rushing sci-fi franchise into a new era while serving as the main incentive to subscribe to an otherwise back catalog-heavy streaming service. Two years later, it’s safe to say that,’s experiment was a success on those counts. CBS All Access is still going strong, and the brand has been revitalized with a bevy of new shows and spinoffs in the works. , may not be the next ,and Disney+ may not succeed as a service. But what’s here so far is a good , TV show, one that takes the existing lore and setting and expands it in a new and exciting way. For now, that’s more than enough of a reason to watch."
Disney+ launch lineup: every movie and TV show available to stream in the US on day one,"

        ",Julia Alexander,"Disney’s foray into an online streaming subscription service, ,, is now live. We’ve updated this post with the company’s full launch lineup — including some of the missing Marvel movies and animated series, along with the first three ,movies.,The company initially used a , — more than 300 tweets in total — to make the announcement. The thread included obvious titles like ,and ,, alongside older titles like ,, ,, ,, and ,.

There are a few originals on the list, including the ,live-action spinoff series ,,,, and ,live-action remake. That’s in keeping with Disney’s strategy of selling its streaming service on the concept of nostalgia and whole-family viewing options. ,The titles coming to the US are more or less in line with what European subscribers will see, with a few notable exceptions. Part of that has to do with rights distributions — it’s why ,isn’t available on the service yet. Disney is working to get back rights to the titles it’s leased to other streamers (just as other major distributors, like NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia, are slowly buying back the rights to their top shows for their own streaming services), but given the value of Marvel and Disney titles, the process may take some time.,“I think as you can see from what we’re making available … at launch, there’s been a lot of effort that went into bringing it all back together,” Michael Paull, head of streaming services at Disney, ,. ,Disney+’s launch lineup is still an impressive windfall for Disney stans.

"HBO won Emmys night, but the future belongs to streaming platforms  ","
          Sep 23, 2019, 12:44pm EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"Last night’s Emmy Awards was nothing new. , at TV’s most prestigious event. Yet the most interesting part of the evening wasn’t necessarily who won, but the commercials for major streaming services that played between acceptance speeches, a signal of how stretched out TV is about to become. ,The ads were louder this year. The Emmys, airing this year on Fox, were full of commercial spots for ,, ,, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix. There were a few scattered promotions for standard broadcast networks, including commercials for new series like ,and network favorites like ,, but it was a streaming service’s world. Apple used the Emmys evening to ,; Disney kicked off the evening by securing the first commercial break, playing a new commercial for Disney+ and ,.,Even people at the Emmys poked fun at the incoming war for people’s money. Comedian Thomas Lennon started off his evening announcing the awards show by cracking a joke about the real battle of the evening being between HBO Now’s $14.99 subscription fee and Netflix’s $12.99 price. HBO won when it came to award numbers (nine), but it was closely followed by Amazon (five) and Netflix (four). As , ,’ Kyle Buchanan ,, this year’s “Emmy telecast is really making the case against television.” ,Or maybe a case against a , era of television. TV is getting bigger, and trying to catch everything is becoming more difficult. The plethora of commercials for streaming services last night was a stark reminder that in order to be in the cultural conversation for the next few Emmy ceremonies, after newcomers like Disney, Apple, and maybe even Quibi enter the race, people will have to subscribe, subscribe, subscribe. That’s on top of shelling out for services from Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu. And that doesn’t account for possible contenders on , or ,. As ,, “In many ways, this year’s Emmys feels like the end of one TV era, as the farewells of ,and ,remove two dominant HBO players from the competition.” ,Talking about the , a catch-all term to describe the mob of new services coming out within the next eight months, has largely been focused on price. How much will it cost to have two subscriptions? Three? All of them? Other conversations have focused on high-bid exclusives. Netflix reportedly paid more than $500 million for ,, WarnerMedia supposedly paid $425 million ,, and NBCUniversal apparently ,. Last night’s Emmys opened a new conversation about the streaming wars: the cultural cost of not keeping up with every hot show on every single service. ,It’s already happening. A quick anecdote: After the Emmys ended, I texted my mother, an avid TV watcher and longtime awards show fan, to ask if any of her favorite shows won. With the exception of NBC’s ,and Netflix’s ,, she hadn’t watched any of the shows. She doesn't watch HBO shows, and with the exception of Netflix, she doesn’t subscribe to any services. No Hulu or Amazon Prime Video; and there’s no interest to purchase a plan for Apple TV Plus, Disney+, Peacock, or any other service. It’s becoming more difficult for her to be part of the conversation as the future of TV moves away from TV. ,Broadcast is still fighting to remain relevant, and still producing series worthy of attention. This week alone, NBC, ABC, Fox, and CBS are set to debut 64 shows. It’s a callback to event television, harkening back to an era before companies like Amazon and Apple were included in television awards show conversations. It’s a facet of competing for attention that , are also thinking about. ,Television has changed from decade to decade. There used to just be a few broadcast networks, then cable became a thing. That was followed by premium cable and, now, streaming services. The evolution of how people watch TV isn’t surprising. The difference between various broadcast networks, premium cable dominating television viewing, and streaming is how we watch. Streaming removes the channel flipping aspect, where different shows on different networks could be found simply by clicking through. Now, networks and companies are asking subscribers to visit one specific service and stay there. If someone only subscribes to one or two services, the chance they’ll see a show people are talking about decreases substantially. ,The Emmys as an awards show will still look the same in years to come — dramas and comedies will be nominated; actors, writers, and directors will show up to make their speeches. But how many of those shows will people recognize? Or how many will they have watched? Everything is shifting; ,’,send-off last night acted as a reminder that television can be a beautiful communal affair, but that changes when TV gets more spread out and exclusive through different streaming services. There are about to be more shows than ever thanks to new entrants like Apple, Quibi, and Disney+. How many future nominated series people watch will largely depend on how many streaming services they’re willing to pay for — or what they decide to pirate. Not everyone will subscribe to every service, and no one has the time to watch everything. ,If the Emmys no longer reflect what the majority of people are watching, because people are sticking to two or three streaming services, what purpose does the show serve? The Emmy Awards already feel like a show by industry people for industry people — talking about how to make the Emmys more appealing as a show is an entirely different piece — but if audiences are divided even more by streaming silos, a bigger question becomes why should anyone care if they don’t recognize a big portion of the nominated series?"

The Downton Abbey movie is a terrific excuse to revisit Gosford Park,"
          Sep 20, 2019, 12:03pm EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,, a multi-Oscar-nominated 2001 drawing-room mystery, written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman. A riff on the classic “murder at a sprawling country estate” story, the movie features a cast of accomplished UK and American actors — including Helen Mirren, Richard E. Grant, Stephen Fry, Clive Owen, Emily Watson, Kelly Macdonald, and Ryan Phillippe — playing 1930s rich folks and servants, gathered for a weekend of dining and hunting that gets interrupted by their host’s suspicious death. Altman and Fellowes have fun with the rigidity of the British class system and the arcane rituals of service — just as Fellowes would do again a decade later with the creation of hit TV series ,.,Because the feature film version of , arrives in theaters across the United States this weekend.,Fellowes’ visually splendid, addictively melodramatic series became a sensation when it debuted on ITV in 2010 and then on PBS in the US in 2011. Over the course of its six seasons, , covered roughly 15 years in the life of the landed, aristocratic Crawley family as well as their servants and tenants. Set between 1912 and 1926, the show charts how the turbulence of the early 20th century — the wars, economic booms and busts, and various progressive social causes — eroded England’s old order, closing the curtain on an era when only the idle rich could dictate how their country was run.,The 2015 series finale left the door open for more stories about the Crawleys. The ,movie is set in 1927, and it uses the hubbub of a royal visit as a way to catch fans up on what the family and their employees have been up to since the show ended. The two-hour film — running just a little less than the length of three TV episodes — mixes the show’s usual wry humor and exaggerated intrigue into an examination of how even the honor of hosting a king and queen could come to mean something different in a decade marked by pro-democratic and anti-colonialist movements.,From the start, , won acclaim for its lavish re-creations of period fashions and decor. But the show’s massive popularity was just as attributable to its soapy plots, which dealt with forbidden romance, sexual indiscretion, and yes, murder. In that way, the series was a natural successor to ,. (, was originally developed as a TV version of , before Fellowes decided to take the project in a different direction.) On a narrative level, the 2001 Altman movie is like several episodes of the series: over the course of its 137 minutes, it gradually reveals shocking secrets about the relationships between the servants and their employers, while exposing the many sins of the estate’s lord, stabbing victim Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon).,Tonally, , is very different from ,, thanks largely to Altman. The director had only five years left to live when he made this film, and, at the time, he had recently received a heart transplant. Late in his career, Altman entered a gentler phase, losing a lot of the satirical bite and acerbic cynicism of his earlier movies and replacing them with a genuine affection for watching talented actors do their work. For a film about homicide and class conflict, , is surprisingly congenial.,Anglophiles and Altman fans.,The late, great Robert Altman believed the director’s job was to create a sense of reality — not ,, per se, but a belief within the audience that the world they were seeing extended beyond the bounds of stage or screen. Altman moved the camera restlessly, giving the impression that there was always more to look at than he had the capacity to show. He encouraged his casts to improvise as much as they wanted and to keep talking even when they weren’t the focus of a scene, just in case they ended up in one of his long, drifting shots.,’s cast of theater-trained veterans stayed fairly faithful to Fellowes’ words, aside from some off-handed remarks at the edges of the frame. But Altman and the actors still foster an illusion of spontaneity through their relaxed line-deliveries and subtly reactive facial expressions. (Dame Maggie Smith, who went on to star in ,, does as much with an arched eyebrow and a forced smile as she does with Fellowes’ witty quips.) , has sometimes been criticized as reactionary, as Fellowes appears to pine for the vanished England where everyone knew their place. But there isn’t much nostalgia in ,, which feels deeply lived-in and populated by people who appear exhausted by the burdens of their stations.,is airing on Showtime this month, so it’s available via the Showtime streaming service. To catch up with ,, meanwhile, turn to Amazon Prime Video, which is also the home of Fellowes’ first post-,television project, an entertaining miniseries adaptation of Anthony Trollope’s novel ,."

"In season 4, The Good Place goes back to its strengths","
          Sep 26, 2019,  1:54pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"The Good Place.,NBC’s cosmic comedy , started in 2016 as a quirky fantasy sitcom starring Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop, a self-proclaimed “Arizona dirtbag” who winds up in the titular heavenly realm due to a clerical error. Her attempts to avoid being detected and booted to the Bad Place didn’t seem sustainable as a long-term story — but that’s because they were never meant to be. Instead, ,creator Michael Schur and his team defied sitcom traditions by constantly reinventing the show over the course of three seasons, taking the characters through a version of Dante’s ,that ventured to absurdist versions of heaven, hell, and places in between.,That ambition let , deliver some incredible plot twists and biting comedy, but it didn’t always work out. Season 3 suffered from whiplash as it changed the frame and stakes too much. The season started out by questioning whether people could improve themselves after having near-death experiences. Then it had the protagonists acting as bodhisattvas, forsaking their own redemption to help others. Then they wound up fighting to correct a broken system that doomed every human to eternal torment. Without a focused narrative, the humor dulled into a series of gags, propped up by guest stars who overstayed their welcome.,The end of season 3 set up a course correction for the series and its cosmology, bringing the characters back to the Good Place neighborhood where the show started. Schur tasked them with trying to redeem the souls of four dead people, and through them, all humanity. The return to familiar turf works beautifully as the show moves into its fourth and final season, setting up plenty of funny and sweet callbacks. It also shows how much the characters have grown, and how far they’ll still have to go to achieve their goals.,Season 4 picks up immediately after the season 3 finale. Eleanor has taken on the role of the neighborhood’s divine architect, though the cosmic suburb is actually being held together by the near-omniscient artificial being Janet (D’Arcy Carden). They’re joined by the reformed demon Michael (Ted Danson), the perpetually name-dropping socialite Tahani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil), and the dumb but endearing troublemaker Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto) on a mission to prove that four humans can change for the better, even if they were bad people throughout their lives.,That’s no easy task, given that the damned souls the crew is out to redeem include John Wheaton (Brandon Scott Jones), a gossip columnist chosen by the Bad Place to torment Tahani. Even more challenging is Brent Norwalk (Ben Koldyke), a living embodiment of white male privilege who drops random jabs at ,into rants about political correctness. He also wants to know why he isn’t spending eternity with a list of buddies that’s clearly modeled off the group of hard-partying high-school friends that surrounded Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The team is also one member down, after indecisive philosophy professor Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper) agreed to have his memories erased to help his season 3 love interest, neurologist Simone Garnett (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). ,Putting the characters back in their old neighborhood lets them revisit earlier plots and behaviors from a new perspective. Eleanor feels almost like Bethany Sloane in ,, a normal person saddled with saving the world while still grappling with her own insecurities. Michael, who held the architect role in the first and second seasons as a means of getting humans to emotionally torture each other, has stepped back to let Eleanor shine, but he still delivers some wonderful inspirational speeches that remind viewers of his old wicked ways. His salvation in previous seasons might have seemed rushed, but this season, he’s quick to remind viewers that he knows the other characters so well because he studied the best ways to hurt them.,Tahani is also clearly still struggling to let go of the insecurities that damned her. While her best moments will always involve sharing ludicrous celebrity-laden anecdotes, she has some genuinely touching moments bonding with John by showing how a desire for status can hurt people on both sides of the velvet rope. The writers are also working hard to find more to do with Jason, the cast’s least improved player. He delivers some great laughs in his trashier interactions with Eleanor, but as of episode 4 of the new season, he’s clearly on a path that will push his character to catch up with his compatriots’ growth. (NBC made the first four episodes of the 14-episode season available to critics before the premiere.),Wiping Chidi’s memory lets the show bring back the neurotic, anxious version of the character that Eleanor eventually fell in love with, and it sets up a major conflict, as she’s forced to put aside her feelings for him and drive him and Simone together for the good of the group’s moral experiment. ,has always spent a lot of time dwelling on philosophy, but the overt lectures have taken a back seat this season, aside from Chidi getting Simone to accept that she’s in the afterlife, not just undergoing a complicated hallucination while dying. That scene is a sweet moment that rekindles the strong chemistry the actors had in season 3, even if it does mark an end to Simone’s hilarious attempts to prove she’s dreaming, which include showing up to a fancy party wearing foam hands.,Season 4 has fewer scenes in actual classrooms, but the show’s philosophical underpinnings are still key. The focus has shifted to utilitarianism, with both Eleanor and Chidi sacrificing their personal happiness for the greater good. Agents of the Bad Place, led by Michael’s vengeful but acerbic former boss Shawn (Marc Evan Jackson), are trying to stymie the protagonists’ experiment at every turn, but the show hints at a possible compromise that would be in everyone’s best interests.,In season 1, the main characters become better people because they’re being tortured, and have to work together to help each other. When Chidi is stripped of responsibility and anxiety in the new version of the neighborhood, he rests on his laurels. He only starts to help others when he’s pushed into a situation that makes him deeply uncomfortable. In that way, , suggests that people behave better when they’re uncomfortable, and that the best outcome for humanity might involve at least a little pain. (Just not the Bad Place’s ideal of an eternity of repeated dick-flattening and reinflating.),In season 4, the dialogue feels a bit sharper than it did in season 3. And episode 4, “Tinker, Tailor, Demon, Spy,” comes the closest the show’s gotten to its highest point: season 2’s episode “The Trolley Problem.” The new episode has the usual splashes of absurdist humor, most notably a Pictionary drawing that comes to life as a nightmare creature. But it becomes a bottle episode that delves into the show’s fragile group dynamics, the nuances of its cosmology, and the strengths and weaknesses of individual characters, all by confronting the crew with the possibility that they have a Bad Place spy among them.,The writers clearly thought through all the easy ways out of the problem, building a conflict that explores the ethics of lying and the potential for redemption, while also leaving plenty of room for hilarious gags like Jason being way too eager to see Michael’s horrifying demonic form. It’s ,at its best, using a moral dilemma to force its dysfunctional cast of characters to work together, and cutting what could be a saccharine moral with barbed jokes and startling twists. If the rest of the season can deliver more episodes of that caliber, then the show will be able to save itself from its season 3 purgatory and return to the divine heights it’s capable of reaching."
Batman casts a heavy shadow over The CW’s new Batwoman series,"
          Oct  2, 2019,  3:06pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,", the latest entry in The CW’s Arrowverse slate of TV shows based on DC Comics, is set in a version of Gotham City where Batman has been missing for three years. To combat the crime and despair that’s spread through her town, Bruce Wayne’s cousin Kate Kane (Ruby Rose of ,and ,) borrows his equipment and mantle and takes to the streets.,In the first two episodes of ,, which premieres on Sunday, October 6th, most of Gotham just believes Batman has finally returned. Kate hasn’t established her own superhero identity yet. And neither has her show, which feels stitched together from Batman canon, Batwoman’s comics, and elements of other gritty comic book shows.,Kate has her own obligatory tragic backstory, featuring a car accident caused by one of the Joker’s plots. Batman bought enough time for Kate to escape, but the car fell off a bridge with her mother and twin sister, Beth, still in it. Her father Jacob Kane (Dougray Scott of ,) found a mission in Batman’s failure and created the Crows, a private security firm staffed by elite veterans. The ,pilot shows Kate undergoing intense training to join the family business. Then she’s called to help save her former girlfriend and Crow member Sophie Moore (Meagan Tandy) from Alice (Rachel Skarsten), a murderer and terrorist with a penchant for quoting Lewis Carroll, but no relation to Batman’s own ,-themed villain, the Mad Hatter. Alice is Batwoman’s primary enemy in the comics, and two episodes in, the show is already setting up a dynamic akin to Batman and the Joker, where the two define each other and push each other to extreme action.,The problem is that this, like so much of ,, is familiar material. The show’s tough, brooding protagonist makes it feel similar to ,, and it’s clearly meant to be an , replacement, since that show is launching its eighth and final season on October 15th. But while , kicked off with a bizarre mix of elements from ,,,,,and ,, the beginning of ,feels like a much more straightforward mix of street-level heroics and soap-opera family drama.,also had the advantage of riding the leading wave of modern superhero TV shows, which let it escape much comparison with other entrants in a crowded field. ,instead faces comparisons with the much higher production values of Netflix’s Marvel Cinematic Universe shows. In the DC Extended Universe, ,has distinguished itself with its higher power level and overtly political plotlines, while ,and ,lean into superhero silliness. But the grittiness of , puts the show more in line with Netflix’s ,or ,.,While Netflix’s shows were narratively inconsistent, they delivered phenomenal performances accompanied by gorgeous sets and genre-defining fight scenes that The CW’s budget simply can’t support.,While the actors may settle into a better dynamic later in this opening season, most of the performances in the first two episodes feel stiff. Skarsten’s performance is the highlight of the show so far, swiftly alternating between whimsical dialogue and vicious threats. But other characters are dealing with the heavy burden of getting enough exposition out of the way to set up a supporting ensemble for Batwoman, in the style of all the other CW shows. That cast includes Kate’s med-student stepsister Mary Hamilton (Nicole Kang) and Luke Fox (Camrus Johnson), son of the Wayne Enterprises researcher played by Morgan Freeman in the Christopher Nolan films. When Kate finds the shockingly obvious secret entrance to the Batcave in Bruce Wayne’s office, Luke agrees to rework one of Batman’s suits to fit her, and teaches her about the hero’s array of useful gadgets. It’s infuriating that so far, Kate still hasn’t asked him how he learned Bruce’s secret, what happened to her cousin, or any questions that don’t suit her immediate needs.,’s writers,have followed in the footsteps of the first seasons of ,and ,by giving their title character an unavailable love interest. Kate and Sophie met while attending a military academy that banned gay relationships. Their romance got Kate expelled, and Sophie renounced her to stay enrolled, eventually graduating and marrying a man. It’s a powerful reminder that while significant progress has been made in LGBT equality, discrimination based on sexual orientation is still legal within many US institutions.,That conflict also has a lot more depth than the ones in ,and , where the heroes pretty much had to wait for their romantic rivals to die so they could make their moves. As Mary puts it during a beautifully awkward family breakfast, “Can we talk about the fact that [Sophie’s] married to a man? I’m not trying to label her or anything, but what’s her deal, exactly?” Sophie doesn’t seem particularly happily married, but the question remains whether she’s bisexual, or has suppressed her sexual identity to help her career. Considering the powerful on-screen chemistry she’s shown with Kate, hopefully it won’t take a full season and a dramatic death for them to figure it out.,For a show about an openly gay woman, ,is otherwise surprisingly conservative in its politics. While most of the Arrowverse shows are produced in Vancouver, , shot some of its exterior scenes in Chicago, the same city where ,was filmed. Chicago’s high rates of gun violence have made it a punching bag for Republicans arguing ,, and this version of Gotham carries through the theme by making the city into a nightmare of urban decay. It’s particularly jarring seeing shots of the city’s landmark areas, which are typically populated by international tourists, instead covered with trash and homeless encampments.,The conservative messaging goes beyond the visual cues. While Kate decided to become Batwoman instead of joining the Crows, viewers are still meant to sympathize with Jacob and Sophie as they operate a paramilitary organization within a major American city. Gotham’s police want to lock Alice up in Arkham Asylum, even as she questions Kate’s sanity, in an homage to the “Who’s crazier?” question at the heart of many Batman and Joker plots. Given the controversy around the release of ,and mental illness repeatedly being used as a political scapegoat for mass shootings, it’s unfortunate that , couldn’t take a more nuanced, original approach to the issue.,Rose’s version of Batwoman,first appeared on-screen in 2018 in the Elseworlds Arrowverse crossover event, and the first few episodes of , actually take place before that plot, to establish how she became Gotham’s protector. Two episodes in, she has yet to don the distinctive bright red wig she wore in that event, the one that makes it clear she’s a different Caped Crusader from the one who’s built such a huge fandom. Presumably, the wig will eventually be a plot point showing she isn’t satisfied with living off her cousin’s powerful reputation, and that she intends to forge her own path. Hopefully by then, ,’s writers will be on track to do the same thing."
Transparent’s musical finale lays out the series’ intent and its legacy,"
          Oct  1, 2019, 12:58pm EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"About halfway through ,’s movie-length series finale, which hit Amazon on September 27th, the feisty Shelly Pfefferman (played by Judith Light) sings a song to her judgmental middle-aged children called “Your Boundary Is My Trigger,” where she uses the kids’ own language against them. She says that every time they block her from commenting on or meddling in their lives, she considers it a personal assault because it’s like they’re convicting her of bad parenting without letting her mount a defense. The moment is classic ,, playfully interrogating modern therapy-speak, while also understanding that when troubled people finally own their feelings, the process can hurt others.,The scene is also, frankly, kind of hard to watch, because the song itself is so clumsy and corny. But then that’s true to ,, too.,Throughout the show’s first four seasons, creator Jill Soloway took huge chances not just with ,’s storytelling, but with its characters. Soloway was never afraid to let the members of the Pfefferman family come off as whiny or self-absorbed, because that was the whole point of the series. ,suggests that working toward becoming a better person sometimes forces people to elevate personal needs over the comfort and complacency of a group. But that wrenching kind of change ultimately affected , itself, as behind-the-scenes drama and larger cultural trends affected the way even longtime fans saw the show.,It’s impossible to discuss ,’s legacy without confronting the problem of Jeffrey Tambor, who won an Emmy for playing Maura Pfefferman, the series’ lead character: a well-to-do former UCLA professor who transitions from male to female late in life. (She’s the “trans parent” of the title.) When Tambor was accused of sexual harassment and abusive behavior in 2017 — not long after season 4 debuted — the scandal raised questions about this cutting-edge dramedy’s progressive bona fides.,Tambor doesn’t appear in ,’s final episode, titled “Musicale Finale.” He predicted in 2017 that he’d be dropped from the show, but he didn’t officially resign. Instead, Amazon Studios conducted an official investigation into the allegations, then cut ties with the actor. The finale’s plot easily explains the absence: it’s set in the wake of Maura’s death, and it’s about how the family struggles to move on.,Removing the character who’d been the face of , since it launched in 2014 doesn’t seem that jarring, because the truth of the matter is that Tambor had been a thorny issue for the series for a while… not because of anything he’d done, but because he isn’t transgender himself. Soloway initially defended the decision to cast a cisgender actor as Maura, noting that Tambor’s name and performance (which, for the most part, was brilliant) brought visibility to the project, and gave the show enough clout to fill the cast with trans performers. But the longer the show stuck around — and the more it illuminated the perspectives of trans women — the more off-brand that original choice became., was never wholly about Maura, though. The show was inspired by the experiences Jill and their sister Faith went through when the person they’d known their whole lives as their father suddenly became their mother. So most episodes of the show spent just as much time following the lives of the Pfefferman children. The restless Sarah (Amy Landecker), the clumsily well-meaning Josh (Jay Duplass), and the adventurous, intellectual Ali (Gaby Hoffmann) — who in later seasons identifies as the gender non-binary Ari — are all deeply affected by Maura’s transition. It gives them permission to face up to their own desires and their own pasts.,In the early episodes, Soloway mostly used the show’s premise to capture and satirize the preoccupations of anxious, upper-middle-class Los Angelenos. But by the end of season 1, ,started becoming more ambitious. The flashback episode “Best New Girl” put Maura’s early attempts at understanding the allure of women’s clothes in the context of sexual exploration and the permissive culture of academia. Season 2 went further, developing Soloway’s themes of Jewish suffering and guilt by connecting the Pfeffermans’ story to the gender-bending decadence of pre-Nazi Berlin.,Later seasons were hampered by the kind of repetitiveness that tends to set in with stories about deeply flawed people. Because it would’ve been undramatic for Maura, Shelly, Sarah, Josh, and Ari to fix themselves, , fell into predictable narrative patterns, where the Pfeffermans would have some breakthrough — reckoning with a buried trauma, embracing an identity, committing to a healthy relationship, et cetera — before their usual neediness and self-doubt would knock them back to square one.,That’s why some fans of mature, sophisticated TV never got on board with ,. Not only could the Pfeffermans be bad company, they also weren’t so different from conventional television characters, continually making the same mistakes.,But for the show’s fervent fans, it remained a must-see from start to finish, because any given episode could be another one-of-a-kind classic. Take season 2’s “Man on the Land,” where Maura attends a women’s music festival and is startled to discover that a vocal subset of feminists refuse to celebrate transgender stories, because they see them as another example of men pulling attention away from women. Some ,sequences were startling and beautiful, as in season 3’s “To Sardines and Back,” which starts with a prologue that shows pieces of the Pfeffernans’ life through a pet turtle’s point of view. ,“Musicale Finale” is very much in the spirit of these memorable standalone ,episodes. It’s overstuffed by default. Soloway doesn’t try to put a pretty bow on every storyline, but nearly all the characters, even the non-Pfeffermans, get some screen time to suggest where they might be headed after the closing credits. The finale also includes some fine examples of the show’s tangled ego-clashes. Shelly feels affronted when her kids chastise her for calling Ari their “sister” instead of their “sibling,” at a time when they’re all supposed to be more focused on their grief than on their self-identities. Meanwhile, Ari gets offended that they don’t have a say about Maura’s wish to be cremated.,Mostly, “Musicale Finale” stands out because of its songs (written by Faith, with Jill’s input). Not all of them are as cringe-inducing as “Your Boundary Is My Trigger.” The episode features some truly lovely numbers, including the opener, “Sepulveda Boulevard,” the lilting recurring song “Father’s House,” and the moving “Your Shoes,” in which the actor Shelly has hired to play Maura in a play about her life sings what she’d always wanted to hear her ex-husband say.,Even more than Maura’s death, Shelly’s play is the finale’s unifying element. It’s what gives Soloway (who directed “Musicale Finale,” and co-wrote it with Faith) the chance to comment on Tambor’s absence from the episode, by reminding the audience that this series was always a work of fiction, drawn from real life, but affected by the contributions of the actors and crew. The play also sets up the central clash between Shelly and her children, who resent the way she seems to have replaced them with versions of themselves she can control.,A lot about the finale feels rushed or ill-considered, right up to the catchy but silly closing number, “Joyocaust,” which suggests Jews need to embrace pleasure to put their history of pain behind them. But the meta aspects of Shelly’s play are a conceptual masterstroke. , shouldn’t just be remembered as the show that introduced millions of TV-watchers to a complex, charismatic transgender heroine. It’s also been a show about who gets frame stories, and how. Seen one way, Maura’s journey of self-discovery is inspiring and empowering. Seen another way, her being true to herself has come at the expense of some of her loved ones, and has become a retroactive excuse for lying and infidelity.,The ,finale isn’t wholly about mourning Maura. It’s more about how the culture at large will continue to argue about what we owe to each other and what we owe to ourselves, and whether the two can be reconciled. And it’s a debate worth having, so long as the people involved are honest and open, and can understand that one person’s boundary is another’s trigger."
Netflix’s superhero drama Raising Dion struggles to find a Stranger Things balance,"
          Sep 30, 2019,  4:19pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"A young hero must learn to use his exceptional powers to stop a terrible threat and save his friends, family, and possibly the entire world. It’s a pretty typical setup for a superhero origin story, but Netflix’s new series ,, which launches its nine-episode first season on October 4th, changes things up by making its hero a seven-year-old. Splicing family drama with comic-book action produces some engaging story beats, but the friction between the two genres eventually makes the show fall apart., follows Nicole Warren (Alisha Wainwright), who’s left raising Dion (Ja’Siah Young) alone after his brilliant meteorologist father Mark (Michael B. Jordan of ,and ,) drowns saving a woman’s life. When Dion starts moving objects with his mind, Nicole realizes it’s really going to take a village to raise this kid, and she turns to friends, family, and more unlikely allies to help train and protect him.,While Jordan’s star power and boundless charisma is unfortunately limited to flashbacks and the occasional supernatural vision, creator / writer Carol Barbee has assembled a wonderful cast centered on the show’s charming, precocious title character. Young brings a powerful sense of joy and innocence to Dion as he discovers the extent of his powers and strives to use them to help others. He’s absolutely adorable as he sets about designing his own costume and Fortress of Solitude, which takes the form of a pillow fort in his room. The only sour note is the amount of product placement involved in his tendency to use his abilities to acquire his favorite name-brand snack foods.,Those powers add an extra layer to the traditional family-drama conflicts between Dion and Nicole who’s struggling to maintain a job and care for her son. Mark’s death has forced them to move out of a more affluent neighborhood and sent Dion to a new school where he struggles to fit in, both as a nerdy kid who loves science and comic books and as one of the few black students. ,One of the show’s most poignant episodes centers on an incident where Dion uses his telekinesis to stop skater bully Jonathan (Gavin Munn) from running off with his father’s watch. In a clear sign of racial bias, the principal blames Dion for the fight, forcing Nicole to talk with her son both about using his powers responsibly and about the hard life he’s likely to have ahead of him because of his skin color.,Barbee skillfully addresses the complicated social issues around racism and single parenthood, but she brings in plenty of humor to keep the story from getting too heavy. One of the main sources of comedy is Dion’s godfather Pat (Jason Ritter) who uses his knowledge of comic books to serve as a mentor while fighting with Nicole about his tendency to spoil the kid. Dion’s classmate Esperanza (Sammi Haney), who uses a wheelchair, fuses the show’s social consciousness and silliness. She wistfully talks about the pain of being invisible to the rest of the school, while forcefully pushing herself into the role of his new best friend. She also makes sure Dion’s fortress is up to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.,These grounded, personal conflicts add depth to ,’s superhero fare, which is more boilerplate. Dion is pursued by a monster he dubs “the Crooked Man,” which is apparently killing other people with powers, in the style of ,’ Sylar or ,’s Whispers. The creature’s look appears to have been modeled after the Mind Flayer from , and ,also pays homage to Netflix’s smash hit about kids dealing with the supernatural by setting its theme as Pat’s ringtone. When Nicole and Pat want to understand the nature of both the threat and Dion’s abilities, they dig into Mark’s research for Biona, the science and technology company where he and Pat worked together. At times, that group seems just as shady as the various government operations running the show in ,.,In attempting to give equal time to family drama and science fiction, Barbee,doesn’t fully develop either. An episode meant to establish Nicole’s complicated relationship with her older, more successful sister Kat (Jazmyn Simon) feels flat because so much character development is forced into a single episode. When push comes to shove, Kat is willing to sacrifice her career and romantic relationship for Nicole and Dion, but that loss loses its sting since so little time is spent on showing what those things mean to her.,The issue is even worse when it comes to the complexities of the superhero plot. A major twist is telegraphed early enough that it’s not particularly surprising when it happens, but Barbee never devotes the time to explaining why or how it happens, making the shift feel jarringly abrupt. It’s particularly frustrating since the first season’s final episode includes a flashback to Nicole meeting Mark, which is sweet, but it easily could have come earlier in the show, leaving space for showing why events suddenly come to a head and how the story reached this point.,The climax is also watered down by the dual mandate to have Nicole’s personal plot reach its own conclusion. It’s discordant to watch her get so excited about finally earning health insurance and rekindling her passion for dancing right as her son is being threatened by a murderous monster. Late in the season, , brings up unusually powerful points about male entitlement and accepting boundaries. It directly confronts traditional TV plots, but, again, it’s brought up and resolved so quickly that it loses the intended impact.,Integrating personal dramas into comic-book stories is nothing new. That balance is at the heart of the CW’s slate of superhero soap operas, and it defines Peter Parker’s struggles to manage high school while he’s fighting supervillains. But the distance ,creates between the two elements by centering the story on the hero’s normal mother makes the show feel disjointed. Spider-Man’s plots can come to a head when he has to save a bus with his classmates on it, but there’s no reason for Nicole’s maybe-love-interest dance instructor to show up anywhere near the final showdown with the Crooked Man.,The mundane nature of the personal dramas in , creates further dissonances with the big stakes of its comic-book elements. The CW shows boost soap opera drama to superhero levels work by making the personal plotlines as outsized as the action, as characters learn that close relatives are secret supervillains or time-travelers. ,is clearly trying to mimic , with its intergenerational conflicts and focus on how relationships grow and change in the face of the unknown, but that show’s ensemble nature makes it easier to have a lot of smaller stories that only coalesce during the setpiece finish. After a decidedly underwhelming climax, ,teases its next season by setting up an even more trite cliffhanger. There’s certainly potential in the show’s premise and charming cast, and in its ambitious attempts to address issues that superhero stories normally avoid. But in order to succeed, the writers will need to find a better balance between the disparate parts."
Ryan Murphy’s Netflix series The Politician is a perfect pairing with Election,"
          Sep 27, 2019, 10:40am EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,, a 1999 political satire directed by Alexander Payne and co-written by Payne and Jim Taylor, adapting Tom Perrotta’s novel of the same name. Set in an Omaha, Nebraska high school, the film stars Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick, an energetic overachiever who irritates her smugly idealistic history teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) with her aggressive self-promotion.,“Mr. M” sees Tracy as emblematic of a strain of prissy privilege, deleterious to the great American experiment. Chris Klein plays affable, dim jock Paul Metzler, whom McAllister encourages to enter the race for class president against Flick. Jessica Campbell plays Paul’s lesbian sister Tammy, who becomes the spoiler. , examines the simmering desperation of one middle-aged Middle American teacher, while also commenting on how even the least important political campaigns can devolve into shallow posturing and mudslinging.,Because the ,-esque series ,is now available on Netflix.,Co-created by , producers Ian Brennan, Brad Falchuk, and Ryan Murphy — a team that’s worked in various combinations on the TV series ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and ,, among others — , stars Tony-winning Broadway actor Ben Blatt as Payton Hobart, an upper-class Santa Barbara teen hoping to use a high school election as a springboard toward his larger political goals. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Payton’s doting mother Georgina, while Zoey Deutch is Infinity Jackson, a sickly classmate Payton names as his running mate, to court a sympathy vote., is the first project Ryan Murphy has produced under a lucrative multiyear deal with Netflix. Before the first season even went into production, it had been greenlit for season 2. On the continuum of Murphy’s shows, ,has more in common with , and , than , or ,. The series comments on the superficiality of modern politics, but in a way that’s colorful and cartoonish, with a broadly comic take on privilege and popularity, not bogged down by wonky real-world details. , isn’t exactly a docudrama either, but while its characters are also comical (and rooted in stereotypes), the movie is predominantly about the daily grind of middle-class existence. Payne and Taylor let each of their main characters tell their part of the story via overlapping narration to illustrate the distance between their self-image and their actual behavior and also to mitigate the bitter undertones of McAllister and Flick’s voices with the relative sweetness of the Metzler siblings.,This story, though, is mainly about Mr. M, who teaches the same tedious facts every year, then goes home to his wife’s bland dinners and his secret stash of pornography. McAllister has a lot of options about morality and ethics, but his firmly held convictions don’t keep him from inviting his wife’s best friend to sleep with him — and at an American Family Inn, no less. Payne and Taylor are simultaneously empathetic toward and critical of a man who overestimates his own importance, interfering with a meaningless election in hopes of saving the world from Tracy Flick.,Broderick gives a wonderfully nebbishy performance, and the filmmakers do a fine job of using visual cues to define the smallness of his world — like the recurring image of his automatic seat belt, slowly wrapping tightly around his body every time he gets into his car.,Political junkies and Reese Witherspoon fans.,Witherspoon had a strong start to her career, giving a handful of well-received performances when she was still in her teens and early 20s. , showed off her knack for comedy and for playing larger-than-life, often unapologetically brash characters. Her ferocious Tracy (whose printed last name, “FLICK,” looks pointedly rude in certain typefaces) is a lonely soul with a megalomaniacal bent, for whom the American education system is less about accumulating knowledge and more about running up the score on her transcript.,Payne and Taylor, meanwhile, have fun mocking the drudgery of high school and the pointlessness of high school elections. Mr. M imagines the ritual as an exercise in democracy: it’s the freedom to choose between apples and oranges, he says, as he draws both fruits on a chalkboard as featureless circles. When Paul then astutely notes that his fondness for either apples or oranges varies depending on the day, that’s a funny, pointed metaphor for the fickleness of the American electorate.,Tubi and Vudu are both currently streaming , for free (with commercials). It’s also worth seeking out Payne and Taylor’s 1996 debut feature, ,, which satirizes the abortion debate via the story of a wastrel (hilariously played by Laura Dern) who becomes a national cause célèbre after she gets pregnant.

"This fall anime season is full of superheroes, fantasy, and furries","
          Oct  3, 2019,  1:18pm EDT
        ",D. M. Moore,"This fall season, there are at least 44 new anime series starting, which is a significant challenge for even the most dedicated viewer. It’s time to prioritize. So here are eight of the most intriguing new series from this season, worth checking out for newcomers or longtime anime fans. Most of these shows will be available for viewing internationally within a day of their Japanese air date, thanks to streaming services like Amazon, Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Netflix. We’ll continue to update this post with new information about where and when these shows are streaming as it’s announced.,Along with these eight shows, three of the series (,,,,,and,) from , are continuing into the fall. ,After being away for a little more than a year, , is returning for its fourth season. It’s moved to what will probably be a fall and winter season, most likely because its production studio, Bones, is also working on Shinichiro Watanabe’s , which aired during ,’s usual spring / summer slot. But the additional six months of preproduction is potentially a huge benefit for this season’s planning and pacing as it moves into the next story arc, which is a bit darker and more nuanced than earlier storylines.,The series follows Midoriya, aka Deku, a kid born without superpowers in a world where 80 percent of people have them. Through various circumstances, he impresses his idol, the world’s greatest superhero, All Might, with his struggle to be a hero. All Might is slowly dying, and can’t maintain the charade that he’s fine, so he decides to make Deku the successor to his powers.,The new season sees Deku and his superhero high school classmates getting a taste of what the day-to-day of a normal superhero is like, as they intern at different superhero agencies. Deku ends up at the agency of All Might’s former sidekick, despite the former duo no longer being on good terms with each other. Meanwhile, the agencies are involved in investigating the last remaining yakuza clan, who become entangled with the League of Villains in a last-ditch attempt to survive. At the same time, Deku is forced to confront what it means to be the heir to All Might’s powers, now that All Might can no longer be a hero.,Season 4 of , will stream on ,, ,, and , starting October 12th.,is naturally going to draw a lot of comparisons to Disney’s ,, since both are CG animated stories about anthropomorphized animals living in a modern human-like society where there’s peace, but still a societal divide between carnivores and herbivores. From there, though, , diverges into a high school noir story like Rian Johnson’s ,, centering around the drama club of a private school where an herbivore student actor is brutally murdered. The story follows Legoshi, a giant gray wolf, as he tries to discover who killed his friend while also navigating his complex feelings for Haru, a dwarf rabbit student.,The series is being animated by Orange, which made a name for itself with the critically acclaimed 2017 adaptation of the ,manga. That was both an amazing series that captured the unique style of the original comic, and a technical marvel of 3DCG animation that added new elements. It seems like Orange is taking a similar approach with ,,,which because of the style of the manga, might never have become a traditionally animated series.,starts airing on October 9th. It will stream weekly on , in Japan, but likely won’t be available to stream elsewhere until early 2020.,This is the second anime adaptation of the , manga, which ran from 1993 to 2012. The series became well known for its realistic art style and gruesome violence, as it follows a swordsman who’s cursed with immortality by a centuries-old nun for having killed hundreds of samurai. As penance, he sets out to kill a thousand evil men, and ends up fighting the students of a new sword style, who are wreaking havoc across the country.,This adaptation is being done by Liden Films (,, ,), and it’s planned to draw out the entire story from the manga, unlike the 13-episode 2008 anime, or ,’s 2017 live-action film adaptation. The series may be Amazon’s first exclusive anime series, as it’s set to stream on the service worldwide, with no apparent plans to air on Japanese TV.,will steam on , starting October 10th., is a retelling of the main story from the incredibly popular Japanese RPG mobile game ,. The first season, which ran in 2017, is a great streamlined retelling of the game’s introductory chapters. It treats the story straight, like a serious fantasy tale, without any sorts of winks toward gameplay systems or other artifacts of adaptation. That makes it a perfect way to experience the game, which isn’t technically available outside Japan, even though there’s an English translation.,The story is set in a fantasy world where everyone lives on floating islands. It centers around Gran, a young man looking to one day travel to a legendary island at the end of the sky. He’s given that chance after encountering Lyria, a mysterious blue-haired girl being chased by the Erste Empire, which wants to use her as a weapon.,(Season 2) will stream on , and , starting October 4th.,Given the recent overabundance of , shows (that is, series about a normal person being transported into another world, like , or ,), fans might be reluctant to pick up yet another one. Especially since most modern iterations of them are power fantasies where a loser type enters a fantasy world where he gets to prove how awesome he actually is, and finally get everything he wants.,But , is a good reminder that not every isekai is like that. Sometimes, they center on interesting ideas like ,, which is about a masked Japanese pro wrestler named Genzo Shibata, who is magically delivered to a fantasy world by a princess. She summoned him hoping he’d kill the demon beasts that threaten her kingdom, but instead, he sets up a pet shop for monsters, since he can’t bear the thought of hurting an animal. It’s such a ridiculous concept, it’s worth checking out and rooting for., will stream on , starting October 2nd.,Speaking of isekai shows with interesting concepts, ,follows,a book-loving college-aged woman who dies and is reincarnated as a five-year-old peasant girl in a medieval European-like fantasy world. Unfortunately for her, books are incredibly expensive, and literacy is very low. So she sets out to start making books herself, hoping to change the world and one day become a librarian.,While it seems from the trailer like she might possess some magical abilities that will help her quest, it’s charming how low-stakes this story appears to be. The show’s cute art style seems geared for kids, which wouldn’t be surprising given the history of the show’s director, Mitsuru Hongo, and the animation studio, Ajia-do. The studio has worked on a lot of kids’ shows, but also series like college otaku drama , and Victorian London romance ,Hongo has directed a number of , kids movies, but also the adult science fiction / fantasy classic ,. So it remains to be seen who the intended audience is here.,will stream on , starting October 2nd.,Working through the title seems like the easiest way to explain this one. , is one of the most popular, profitable mobile games in the world. Players collect characters based on real and fictional heroes, which are sort of amalgamations of their legends and their supposed actual identities. In the game, all of human history, past and future, has been incinerated except for your character and a small staff at a magical observatory. In order to find out what happened and reverse it, you’re tasked with going into the past. This standalone series is skipping most of the game’s story to only adapt its seventh chapter, where you’re sent back to ancient Babylonia during the reign of King Gilgamesh, who’s fending off an invasion of strange demons. (Hence the show’s subtitle.),Rather than produce a complete adaptation of the game’s story like the , anime, production studio Cloverworks (,, ,) is starting with this chapter, which was chosen by a fan vote. (Along with another chapter, which is being adapted into ,.) But it’s hard to tell how comprehensible this might be to new viewers. However, there should be enough compelling stuff in the Babylonia story for a newcomer, with Gilgamesh becoming a ruler after the death of his partner Enkidu, his interactions with Babylonian gods like Ishtar, and heroes out of their time like Merlin. At the very least, it promises to be an animation showpiece, thanks to ,.,’s episodes will stream exclusively on , for 30 days, before they stream on ,. It starts October 5th.,This manga adaptation is being animated by renowned animation studio Madhouse (,, ,, ,, , season 1). It’s a hard-boiled cyberpunk noir show about a private detective who has a revolver for a head. ,That sentence alone is probably all you need to know if you’re interested in watching this show., starts October 10th and will stream on ,."
"In season 3, Netflix’s Big Mouth keeps improving and maturing (and immaturing)","
          Oct  4, 2019,  1:30pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"The raunchy Netflix animated comedy , started as an absurd yet deeply personal show about the horrors of puberty, from inconveniently timed first periods to embarrassing uncontrolled erections. But just as the show’s theme, “Changes,” implies, creators Nick Kroll, Andrew Goldberg, Mark Levin, and Jennifer Flackett never intended this show to stay static. While it’s experienced some growing pains and still has some painfully awkward moments, it’s developing into a remarkably powerful and entertaining comedy.,Middle schoolers exploring their sexuality is still the driving force of ,which released its 10-episode third season on October 4th. But the show has expanded to follow other equally challenging teen issues, like academic pressure, mental health, and the changing dynamics between friends. While the show follows many of the traditional sitcom beats, it’s crafted a rich mythology and personal history for its characters that means new viewers will want to start from the beginning to be able to appreciate all the callbacks and see how much the characters have grown.,The main tension of the season is between best friends Nick Birch and Andrew Glouberman, voiced respectively by Kroll and John Mulaney. Nick was the sensitive smart-aleck to Andrew’s nerdy pervert for the past two seasons, but now he’s gotten more confident with the help of the Hormone Monstress Connie (Maya Rudolph of ,and ,).,Connie and her male counterpart Maurice (also voiced by Kroll) have always been the absolute highlight of the show, which is why they’re going to be the subject of a newly announced spinoff series called ,. The monsters serve as invisible mentors to the young heroes, providing deeply questionable advice about kissing, masturbation, and sending dick pics. The season 2 finale, “The Department of Puberty,” provided a look at how they work in concert with anthropomorphized versions of various body parts and emotions to guide kids through healthy development, though they aren’t all particularly good at their jobs.,Connie joined Nick after he had a succession of much worse monsters. Nick was late to develop, and in season 1, he was accompanied by the crusty, ancient, barely discernible Hormone Monster Rick (also voiced by Kroll). When Rick retired, he was replaced by the overly enthusiastic childlike Hormone Monster Tyler (John Gemberling of ,) who Nick banished after discovering he was working with the Shame Wizard (David Thewlis of the , films). Both characters were worse for Nick than Connie, but they were also less entertaining as foils. While Connie still delivers terrible advice like encouraging Nick to kiss Andrew’s ex-girlfriend, the extra time with her strengthens the show.,The show’s creative team has also built on the complicated personal dramas that were introduced in season 2 and the surprisingly sweet Valentine’s Day special, providing a payoff for previously underdeveloped characters. Jay Bilzerian (comedian Jason Mantzoukas) was an obnoxious sideshow at the start of the show, perpetually annoying and disgusting the other characters with his obsession with magic and humping pillows. The pillows were anthropomorphized as women, and in one plot that really overstayed its welcome, Jay’s favorite pillow gets pregnant, gives birth to a baby pillow, and runs off.,But Jay also started masturbating with couch cushions, which were anthropomorphized as male. Suddenly, his sexual quirk turned into a way for him to discover his bisexuality. This season, he’s struggling with how to share his revelation with his friends and how to face the stigma against bisexual men. One particularly sweet segment shows him exploring his fantasies by collaborating with his horny spaz classmate Missy Foreman-Greenwald (Jenny Slate of ,and ,) on slashfic starring Missy’s crush Nathan Fillion, who voices himself. It’s a fairly nuanced look at the challenges of coming out, even if Jay encapsulates his sexual orientation by screaming “I want to fuck everyone!”,Matthew (Andrew Rannells of ,) was previously relegated to a stereotypical catty best friend to Nick and Andrew’s sarcastic buddy Jessi Glaser (Jessi Klein), but he finally came into his own in the Valentine’s Day episode by exploring the hardships of being the only openly gay kid in his small town. That adds even more pressure to his first budding relationship. His new connections come at the expense of Jessi who continues to battle the oppression of Depression Kitty (voiced with an oozing seductive malice by Jean Smart of ,and ,).,Jordan Peele has been voicing the ghost of Duke Ellington, who haunts Nick’s attic, since ,’s first episode. But the bit has always seemed just a step too weird even by ,’s standards. Nick didn’t start with his own Hormone Monster, and his visits to Duke always seemed like a poor substitute for the monsters’ running commentary. Duke served a similar function, suggesting Nick could solve his problems through sex and punctuating his advice with historic anecdotes and offputting manic laughter.,But this season, Duke finally gets some highlight moments of his own. His ability to seemingly conjure any other dead celebrity results in a clever musical number about the spectrum of gender identity and sexual orientation, starring Prince, David Bowie, and Freddie Mercury. Nick writing a celebrity book report also provides an excuse for an entire episode set in 1913 where Duke paints a tale of jazz, sex, and the importance of finding your passion. It’s one of season 3’s best stories.,This season, the writers have doubled down on the show’s musical numbers, which vary wildly in tone but are always high-quality. A song in the first episode featuring all the girls in school protesting a dress code meant to protect boys from uncontrollable urges helps set the tone for the whole season. A duet where Jessi and Nick mourn the fact that none of them made it onto their peers’ lists of the hottest people in school, despite their non-appearance-related strengths, is deeply relatable. But the best of the numbers is “Anything Goes in Florida,” a ballad skewering the goofy, genuinely terrible aspects of the Sunshine State, ranging from Spring Break to stand-your-ground laws. It’s a perfect crystallization of the show’s ability to pivot from silly to serious so quickly that it causes emotional whiplash.,The smoothing of the show’s rough edges does make its remaining issues feel all the more abrasive. Kroll voices four main characters and a host of supporting characters, and ,would be stronger if he killed some of his darlings. His idiot gym teacher Coach Steve has been in every episode, even though he’s a one-note gag who feels like a throwback to Adam Sandler’s 1990s films. Coach Steve was fired at the end of season 2 and is blissfully absent from most of season 3, only showing up in a series of odd jobs. His stint as a Lyft driver is the only Steve segment where the jokes actually hit the mark, via a rambling end-credits monologue about the varied ways ride-sharing can be incredibly awkward.,But any goodwill the character earns there quickly falls away in the season’s penultimate episode where Steve gets a makeover from the ,Fab Five, who all voice themselves. ,relentlessly breaks the fourth wall, and jokes focusing on its status as a Netflix show are peppered throughout the season, most bitingly in a jab at ,. But the , episode feels like a 20-minute commercial, and the terrible payoff is that Steve gets his job back, meaning he’ll continue to be a comedic drag on the show.,While the Shame Wizard — the incarnation of embarrassment and self-loathing who was  season 2’s primary antagonist — briefly appears when Andrew visits a Men’s Rights group, he’s otherwise absent this season. That’s a disappointing loss, considering how much powerful conflict he stirred in season 2. He’s also missed since because while season 3 has plenty of memorable moments, it doesn’t reach a satisfying climax like season 2 did.,Season 1 of , was all about how characters experience the beginnings of puberty in different ways. Season 2 had them coming to terms with their new raging hormones and accepting their new selves. Season 3 feels more like a series of vignettes on a theme. The rift between Andrew and Nick isn’t just caused by hormones but by other stresses, like Nick becoming addicted to the idea of social media stardom.

Here’s the best Joker episode of Batman: The Animated Series to stream this weekend,"
          Oct  4, 2019,  1:41pm EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,“Joker’s Favor,” a 1992 episode of ,. Ed Begley, Jr. provides the voice of Charlie Collins, a harried Gotham resident whose road rage gets him into huge trouble when the driver he’s cursing at turns out to be Batman’s archnemesis, the Joker. After pleading for his life, Charlie is let off the hook, provided he promises to answer the call whenever the Joker needs a hand. When Charlie realizes this “favor” might involve helping the supervillain kill Commissioner Gordon and a room full of cops, he tries to figure out how to warn Batman — and how to convince the Caped Crusader he’s just a patsy. ,Because , opens wide in theaters this weekend.,Eagerly anticipated by action-adventure devotees who like their movies grim and gritty, this R-rated addition to the DC Comics cinematic oeuvre stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a soft-spoken wannabe comedian and clown-for-hire who endures a miserable life of poverty and abuse in a decaying Gotham City neighborhood. When Arthur is pushed into an act of violence while on his way back from a gig, his rage — and his makeup — inspires an anarchic anti-authoritarian movement in the city. The film follows this accidental antihero as he grows into his role as a criminal cult leader., borrows liberally from the work of Martin Scorsese — specifically , and , — as well as , and ,. It’s a slow-paced, often punishing film, with a bleak take on human nature, which is unusual for what’s ostensibly a Batman picture (minus Batman).,But it isn’t unprecedented. Phoenix, writer-director Todd Phillips, and co-writer Scott Silver are shadowing Christopher Nolan’s version of the Joker from the movie ,, as played by Heath Ledger. They’re also attempting something similar to what writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland did in the horrifying graphic novella ,. The latter book has been adapted into a 2016 animated film — R-rated as well — by some of the , creative team. The , movie features the voices from the 1990s cartoon: Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker.,Hamill’s Joker may be the best of any of the screen versions of the Joker. In “Joker’s Favor,” for example, he plays the villain as simultaneously unhinged and creepily aware. He stalks Charlie Collins for years after their initial encounter, then bullies him into doing his will. He’s debonair and overbearing — the kind of man everyone wants to avoid at a party. Because , was aimed at a younger audience, this Joker isn’t as scarred or scary as Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix’s versions. But he isn’t cute and harmless, either. Hamill gives the character a sense of panache, but he doesn’t spare the menace.,Bat-fanatics and animation connoisseurs.,“Joker’s Favor” is one of ,’ better-known episodes because it introduced Harley Quinn (voiced by Arleen Sorkin), the Joker’s sassy partner in crime and occasional girlfriend who went on to become a fan-favorite character in further cartoons, comics, and movies. This episode is also a fine illustration of why this show is so beloved among superhero buffs. Director Boyd Kirkland and writer Paul Dini — working with designers / animators Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski, among many other attentive creators — strike a fine balance between a kid-friendly tone and a style that resembles classic film noir, inspired in part by Tim Burton’s more gothic Batman movies.,Also, in contrast to today’s superhero TV shows (and cinema and graphic novels, for that matter), “Joker’s Favor” is a concise, unified piece of storytelling, making no demands that viewers watch 50 episodes or read a decade’s worth of comics to understand what’s going on. It’s as cleverly plotted as a Silver Age comic book from the days when nearly every individual issue could stand alone. One sequence where Charlie rigs up a kind of bat-signal using whatever props he can find is like something out of the late 1950s DC Comics, where stories were focused on heroes thinking their way through problems and relying on their schooling.,But there’s an emphasis on character here, too. The episode defines the Joker by the man he annoys. To Batman, the Joker is a deadly scourge. To Charlie, he’s a nagging inconvenience. In a way, Charlie’s problem is more relatable.,DC Universe. The subscription service has a lot of Joker-related animated movies and TV episodes that are carefully curated and easily accessible via their own page.

Netflix’s Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance builds on everything that made the film great,"
          Aug 30, 2019, 10:54am EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"In 1982, Jim Henson and Frank Oz redefined fantasy filmmaking with ,, an ambitious, puppet-driven movie that tells a wondrous story about an ancient world on the brink of destruction or salvation. In the post-, fantasy licensing frenzy, it would have been easy for Netflix to snap up the rights to the ,world, make a cheap knockoff, and count on nostalgia to lure viewers. Instead, ,and ,director Louis Leterrier has produced a true labor of love. The series , builds on everything that made the film great, and it has the potential to become a classic in its own right.,set on the dying world of Thra, followed two Gelflings — the last survivors of a small, elfin race — on a quest to restore a crystal power source that was corrupted by a malevolent birdlike race known as the Skeksis. ,, which releases its 10-episode first season on August 30th,,is set before those events. The Gelflings are a thriving society of disparate clans loyal to the Skeksis, but are stirred to action when they learn that the Lords of the Crystal are killing Gelflings to extend their own lives. ,While the show uses much of the world-building and some of the plot points from , the show has its own protagonists and structure. The story beats will still feel familiar, given how closely they follow the ,formula. To defeat a terrible evil, reluctant heroes must put aside their differences and band together, find unlikely allies, gather lost lore and weapons, and overcome betrayal. The similarities are particularly strong given that the Gelflings’ short stature and love of music makes them feel distinctly hobbit-like.,The heroes seem unfortunately bland because of the fidelity Jim Henson’s Creature Shop paid to the original puppets and their largely unexpressive faces. While the designers strove to distinguish them with a wide variety of complexions, clothing, and hairstyles befitting their clans and status, the characters feel indistinct in the early episodes. The Skeksis General skekUng (Benedict Wong of ,) lampshades the issue by complaining that he can’t tell the show’s three Gelfling princesses apart. ,While most of the characters eventually come into their own, the Gelfling warrior Rian (voiced by Taron Egerton of ,and the Kingsman series) never really gains any defining personality traits besides being brave and good with a sword. His genericness makes the moments when he’s supposed to be inspiring his people fall flat. Far more nuanced are the scholarly princess Brea (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Deet (Nathalie Emmanuel of ,), who leaves her underground home at a tree’s behest to spread word of a pending ecological disaster.,Still, the first season’s best hero isn’t a Gelfling, but a Podling, a member of an even more diminutive race that the Skeksis use as servants. The aspiring Podling paladin Hup (Victor Yerrid) is only barely capable of communicating with his traveling companions, but he gets by with a heavy dose of expressive charm and by blowing loud raspberries whenever he’s displeased.,Any distinctive qualities the heroes lack is more than made up for by the show’s villains. Leterrier has assembled an incredible cast to play the Skeksis, who alternate between hatching monstrous schemes, bickering with each other, and luxuriating in the pleasures their rule has bought them. Simon Pegg voices the manipulative skekSil the Chamberlain so well that his portrayal is practically indistinguishable from Barry Dennen’s version in the original film. That’s no small feat, considering how much of the character is built on distinctive vocal tics and a sing-song tone that manages to be both comical and ominous. ,Mark Hamill’s voice for sketTek the Scientist is just a few steps removed from the one he’s used for various iterations of Batman’s nemesis the Joker. (The similarity is particularly clear in sketTek’s frequent bursts of maniacal laughter.) Andy Samberg absolutely steals an entire episode as a Skeksis heretic who shares the secret history of the world with the Gelflings through a mix of opera and puppetry, and Jason Isaacs brings the dark gravitas he showed as Lucius Malfoy in the ,films,to the Emperor skekSo. The writers spend plenty of time showing how a profound fear of death leads the Skeksis to commit an escalating series of horrors, and not a moment of that time feels dull or wasted.,The original,film has stood the test of time so well thanks to its puppets and practical effects, which still look distinctive and well-crafted more than 30 years later. ,is committed to maintaining that legacy by minimizing CGI in favor of puppets and animatronics. The detail is absolutely incredible, from the grotesque Skeksis to the menagerie of strange critters that make Thra feel as fully realized as Pandora from ,.,Every episode brings some new visual wonder, like a giant manta-ray-esque creature ridden by a desert-dwelling tribe of Gelflings, a swarm of giant arachnids that assemble themselves into a mouth to speak to the Skeksis, or the carriages the Skeksis ride around Thra, which are controlled by giant pill bugs rolled into wheels.,The constant cavalcade of cute animals and goofy characters is sure to delight kids, but parents eager to share their fond memories of ,should be prepared for just how dark ,gets. Like any epic fantasy, it’s filled with noble sacrifices and tragic deaths, and the writers don’t pull any punches when it comes to showing the Skeksis brutally torturing and murdering characters. The show is in many ways tonally similar to the 1984 fantasy film ,, and it’s likely to traumatize as many children as it delights.,The film established a world that was strange and mysterious, but it barely skimmed the surface of its potential in its 90-minute runtime. The ,writers are filling that blank space in a way that feels natural rather than superfluous. They’ve invented past conflicts, expanded the roles of characters from the film, and built a nuanced social order for the Gelflings that helps explain how the Skeksis came to power and maintained their grasp on Thra for a thousand years. The writers have also created numerous minor touches that add to the character of the world, like beautiful, somber rituals for the choosing of a new Gelfling leader, and a way of mourning that still embraces the show’s central philosophy that death is a necessary, important part of life.,One of the most remarkable feats of building on the source material comes from the show’s use of dreamfasting, a Gelfling ability to share memories through touch. In ,, it was used to quickly share backstories in a visual way, and to build fast intimacy. , expands considerably on the idea, exploring the ways dreamfasting would affect society, from letting couples relive their favorite moments together to a leap of faith that allows strangers to move past possible social deceptions. So much thought went into the ability that the writers even had the Chamberlain show his cleverness by coming up with a way to undermine the power.,All this world-building has the potential to feel terribly depressing for film viewers who already know the fate in store for the Gelfling people. But one of the series’ many clever twists makes it clear that ,isn’t a typical prequel, and that the writers aren’t entirely bound by the film’s events. It’s just another sign that the series’ creators understand why viewers would want to return to Thra and know just how to keep them there. Given that the season ends with multiple cliffhangers, it’s clear that the creators hope to continue the show with that knowledge in mind, further developing the characters and the film’s wondrous world."

The creators of The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance just loved throwing puppets,"
          Aug 29, 2019, 12:42pm EDT
        ",Liz Shannon Miller,"Just because there are puppets involved doesn’t mean , is for little kids. “It’s not like they call it , Light,,” executive producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach joked with , on the eve of the premiere of the Netflix series, which serves as a prequel to the cult-favorite 1982 fantasy drama. ,Grillo-Marxuach worked alongside fellow executive producers Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews to resurrect the world of Thra. They used a mixture of recent technology and old-school craftsmanship to portray the Gelfling clans living under the rule of the evil Skeksis. While aiming for a young adult audience, the story features real stakes, dark twists, and intense action. Louis Leterrier, who helmed , and ,, directed every episode.,Addiss, Matthews, and Grillo-Marxuach sat down with , to discuss the making of the series, which features a remarkable voice cast — including Taron Egerton, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jason Isaacs, Mark Hamill, Eddie Izzard, Keegan-Michael Key, Awkwafina, Simon Pegg, Alicia Vikander, Andy Samberg, and Helena Bonham Carter — as well as some truly state-of-the-art puppetry. How the technology came to aid the storytelling, and vice versa, is almost as fascinating as the story being told.,Well, it’s the marriage of luck and hard work. So [Will Matthews and I] were thinking we’d really like to do a sequel to ,. And we thought, “Well, what are we going to lose?” So we told our agents to call up the Henson Company. They didn’t want to work on ,, but they said, “We’re working on a , thing. Do you want to do that?” So we stayed up all night and came up with a great pitch for a sequel feature. We go in to meet Lisa Henson in her office, and she says, “I’m so glad you’re here to tell us about your idea for our prequel TV show.” And we were like, “Yep, no problem! We can do it!” ,When we got the green light, that was when Javi came in, because we had never been in a writers’ room, much less run one. It was a very collaborative experience. ,We say working on a Jim Henson product is a team sport. With this one more than anything else, the theme of the entire show is unity. The Jim Henson ethos is very collaborative. It involves a lot of different artists in all disciplines, including writing. ,Everything about this project was really informed by this idea that we were all collaborators working on something bigger than all of us. The trope that was circulated was that this was a garden that had been tended for 37 years, and we were coming in to take care of it for a little while. We could decide where to put plants, but it was part of our job to keep the legacy intact and do new honor to that legacy.,Don’t mess up the garden because, hopefully, we get to pass it on to somebody else. We had all the space we wanted — there was never a mandate of “You can’t.” We created whole characters, leads, and arcs. We were given a lot of space. ,To give you a concrete example, we went in and we looked at the head sculpt for the Scientist puppet, and they sculpted him with two eyes. We were like, “Well, in the movie, he’s got a mechanical eye.” And they were like, “We know, but we have to sculpt them in full, and then we will take out the eye and put in the mechanical eye because that’s a separate prop.” And then we said, “Well, we need to tell a story about the Chamberlain’s duplicity and his ability to maneuver events in his favor. Let’s have the Scientist with two eyes at the beginning, and show how he only got one eye.” And then that helped us with our storytelling. , Netflix was developing an animated prequel series. And we came on only after Netflix called up Lisa and said, “Let’s do it with puppets.” She was like, “Are you sure? Do you know how hard that is?” It’s a testament to Netflix that they took this crazy leap of faith and did the show properly. It should be done with puppets. It should be live-action. It should feel tangible. It’s a built, created world. ,It was just luck that when we called up, they were at a new beginning, and we’re like, “Okay, great. Here’s how you do that.” And it all came together.,I think that the animated show was skewing a little younger, a little more magical. We were a little bit more grounded in this world. We felt like this was a much more tangible, dirty world. We spent a lot of time literally dirtying up the puppets.,We looked at this as a 10-hour drama. We never looked at it as “a puppet show.” We came into this with the intention of making, and ,, something that could compete with those properties. And the thing that informed everything we did was that we needed to have characters with rich inner lives and a world with real stakes. ,Yes, and there were times because production was so fast that I would literally just [have the puppeteers mouth] about eight to 10 syllables, and then I could go back later and write the line. I did that very rarely, but sometimes it did happen, and we could create those moments in post as well. , We had Eddie Izzard. It’s one of his great skills. It’s tricky because we have so many rules in terms of words. Like, we try not to assign genders to the Skeksis. It’s very controlled and scripted. But within that, if the performer has an idea, and we can make it match to the mouth-flaps, we’ll come up with a new line. , Eddie Izzard got “bugger” in. , It was really funny, and it made us laugh, so there we go. Everybody’s building off of each other. And the voice actors got very protective of their puppeteers. Like Taron [Egerton] would be like, “No, no, Neil [Sterenberg] is mine.” They form a connection. It’s a synthesis. All of the puppeteers have voices in the show as well, so they’re all over the place. ,On average, I think we were like 200 people because we also had our shops in the warehouse as well. We took over a warehouse space with 89 sets, which was about the size of two football fields. We also had a creature shop in there. So there are a lot of people, even separate from the design and art department, a lot of people in the building separate from what’s on set, if that makes sense. And then our largest days, I think we had 100 puppeteers on set, which is crazy. Some of them are doing radio control or second unit, things like that. Sometimes we had puppeteers just holding two puppets in the air as background because, like, “We need bodies on-screen.” I think if you’d ever picked up a puppet and lived in England, at some point, you wound up working on ,. It was big. ,An amazing thing about puppeteers that I don’t think everyone understands is that they can play the lead on a character, a big part on a lead character, and then in the next shot, they’re someone else’s left hand. They really are a troupe. There’s a lack of ego. They move from one character to the other. It’s really encouraging about humanity. , It really feels like the idea of an old-school theater troupe, where one moment, you’re the lead, and the next moment, you’re handing somebody a cup. That’s how they treat it. It’s really cool.,Usually three. You’ve got the main puppeteer who’s doing the mouth and one arm, then they’ve got an assist doing the other arm, and then there’s somebody doing radio control of the eye blinks, and things like that. Unless you’re Alice [Dinnean], who did Brea. Alice had a separate performance system where she was controlling a lot of that herself, with a literal Wii nunchuck they converted. So she would often only have herself and an assist because she was in control of a lot of those facial movements. ,It’s one of the reasons Brea is so good at eyerolls. ,Yeah, because that’s Alice, doing every part of that performance along with her assist doing the other hand, all simultaneously.,One of the most fun things about doing this job was every Friday, we had a meeting at the creature shop. And we were watching the people there innovate new ways of doing puppetry. So for example, one day we got there, and the 3D printers were just chugging away. Obviously, 3D printing has been a boon to this kind of storytelling. But they were building a system that was custom-designed to the puppeteers’ hands, with individual controllers per finger, so the puppeteer would have complete fidelity from his or her hand movements to the hand at the end of the rod. ,I was also there the day they first tested the AI system with the Wii nunchuck controller. We got to see, in real time, how they were taking this art of puppetry that they’ve done for so long, and in meeting the challenges of the show, creating new technologies to do the things the creature shop has been doing for 50 years. One of the most interesting things was seeing how much 3D printing figures into it now and how much that helps build custom pieces for puppets, custom pieces for everything. That process has been game-changing.,I remember one day at the shop, one of the designers very gently handed me the Emperor’s scepter. He said, “Be careful. This is the original from the film.” And then he accidentally drops it, and I started screaming. And then he was like, “Oh no, I just 3D-printed it. It’s just a perfect match.” [,.],Even though the Jim Henson Company is not exactly lax about archiving — they are the caretakers of the legacy of one of the most venerated creators in popular culture — there are certain things where they had to make guesses. One day, I went to the creature shop, and there was a guy airbrushing Aughra’s skin. He had a magazine that was printed in 1982 when the movie came out, he had stills from the movie, and some of the books that came out when the movie came out. Because nobody could quite figure out what Aughra’s actual color was. She looks different in different shots because of how she’s lit, the way any actor would look different. So sometimes you’re seeing an exact duplicate of what was on-screen 37 years ago, and some things on-screen are educated guesses. ,It wasn’t about limitations. It was about collaboration. Louis had a pretty good idea of how he was going to shoot it. ,It was very impressive storyboarding. I remember a lot of versions of storyboards.,But there’s nothing that I would say that we ever pitched, that anybody ever said, “We can’t do that with puppets, it’s too far.” Which is crazy. ,I mean, everyone’s trying to push the envelope all the time. And so everyone is the best at what they do. And everyone is trying to find a solution. So it was really very free.,An action sequence is no different from a musical number. In a stage musical, it’s what happens when dialogue no longer serves a dramatic purpose. So you always have a true north, whenever you’re staging this kind of stuff, in what is telling the story, what is driving home the emotional stakes. So there are a bunch of sequences where maybe you’re not seeing what we came up with in the room — not because the puppets couldn’t do it, but because there wasn’t enough time or money or what have you. But everything that’s in the show is there to serve the emotional reality of the world and the characters. And whether you’re doing drama or puppets, action sequences are hard to choreograph, technologically difficult. But you always have your true north of what in it is serving the character and the story. ,We treated the puppets the way you would actors in a movie. There’s a big talking point in , coverage about, “Oh, they didn’t use CGI?” Well of course we did. We’re building a world. It’s a huge VFX project. But the puppets are the main event, the puppets are the actors.,The biggest lesson I think we can all learn from CGI in filmmaking is that we need to be selective about what we choose to show on-screen. Because ultimately, one of the drawbacks of being able to do anything and everything is that you get too much. You don’t get enough of the gaps in the storytelling that engage your mind in it. There’s a reason , won the Oscar for Best Editing. It’s because their technology was limited enough that they had to make very strong choices about how the film being put together served that story. And with us doing this, even though we have access to all of this puppetry, even though we have access to CGI technology as well, we needed to look at all this and figure out, when the rubber meets the road, how do we make scenes so they’re only serving story?,That’s a very high-minded answer. I’ll tell you, one of the most fun things is throwing puppets off of things. We just had the best time. So if you watch the show, if you notice in the back half, puppets start getting chucked around more because we just liked it. Just throwing those things was the best. ,They did so much puppet-throwing that it’s going to be an Olympic event.,We got really good at it. , A lot of people are going to see this and assume we did a bunch of things with CGI. And the truth of the matter is that a lot of the time, we didn’t. You are looking at really old-fashioned technologies that are working in concert with CGI. I mean, so much of this of this product is handmade. I think it’ll be interesting to find out what people thought was what and how frequently they’re right or wrong.,Jim Henson wasn’t exactly a Luddite. If you look at, for example, ,, they spent a lot of time and money figuring out how to make Kermit ride a bicycle in the prologue, and then that technology got applied to all of the movies that came afterward. Puppetry isn’t a static art. It’s an art that depends on technology. The technology keeps feeding the craft., That said, there’s nothing better than a couple of Podlings yelling at each other.,Because they are the most puppety. There’s variations of like how puppety you can get with it. Yeah, the Gelflings are more “human.” They have a little bit more weight. But a Podling can run in, scream, fall down, jump up, be drunk, and run out the door, and you’re having a great time. A Gelfling doing that doesn’t feel right; a Skeksis doing that doesn’t feel right. So Podlings are really fun and freeing because they’re just physical comedy.,You haven’t lived until you’ve had Lisa Henson say, “You shouldn’t put that in the script.” “Why not?” “It might be too puppety.” “I guess you’d know!”, I think Netflix does, and I think other people do. We just tried to write the story that felt right to us. We were thinking about younger audiences. We weren’t consciously trying to go to “dark places.” That is part of the show because it’s part of the legacy. There were times when we would have long talks about the violence, but it wasn’t from a perspective of trying to hit an age. It was trying to say, “What’s the point of the violence? What are the repercussions of the violence? And how is it part of this story?”,Yeah, we have a written document that plans out season 2. Everybody’s very excited about it. And now we just wait to see what the numbers are and wait for that phone call that we get to go back to Thra. , If you watch it, we will write it. , I think it would be more efficient, but I would try to use the time to make the show even bigger and crazier. , We know a little bit about what you can do with puppets and what the edge is. But we’re ready to move it to the next level after that.  , Olympic-level puppet-throwing. , Oh my god. It’s so fun to throw puppets."
Amazon’s terrific fantasy Carnival Row works best when it isn’t copying Game of Thrones,"
          Aug 30, 2019, 12:19pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"Since ,ended in May, HBO’s streaming rivals have been racing to capture their share of the viewers who still crave shows packed with fantasy spectacle, intrigue, and sex. Amazon seems especially focused on winning over genre fans: its Prime Video service is currently spinning up an epic-fantasy lineup that promises , and ,. It’s starting its run with the original show ,, which,will release its first eight-episode season on August 30th. It’s a gorgeous, well-written, and unrepentantly political series, but it’s at its absolute worst when the writers try too hard to make it feel like ,.,is set in a world that resembles what the 1800s might have looked like if the great European powers established colonies and fought proxy wars in the realms of the fae rather than in India or Africa. Six years before the series starts, British Empire stand-in The Burge retreated from the fae nation of Tirnanoc, leaving it in control of The Pact, a group inspired by the World War I ,. The defeat caused a refugee crisis, with desperate fae fleeing to The Burge where they’re largely resigned to a life of menial labor and discrimination.,The story primarily follows Burge investigator Rycroft Philostrate (Orlando Bloom of ,and , franchises) and fresh-off-the-boat faerie Vignette Stonemoss (Cara Delevingne of ,). The two met and fell in love during the war, bonding by sharing a copy of Philo’s favorite scientific-romance novel, and both were left deeply damaged by their parting. A romance novel also sparks an impossible relationship between two soldiers in Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples’ ,comic book series, but while the concept isn’t original, Bloom and Delevingne’s powerful performances bring life to the haunted, soulful Philo and fierce but brittle Vignette.,During their courtship, Vignette and Philo discuss the transcendent power of stories in a way that’s reminiscent of Tyrion’s awful electioneering monologue in the ,But the metatext feels earned here because of the nuanced work series creators René Echevarria (,) and Travis Beacham (the writer of the original script , is based on) are doing to explore empathy and discrimination. ,avoids simplistic narratives where the persecuted fae are good, racists are bad, and the best path for everyone is liberal inclusivity. Instead, they delve into the systemic problems that trap people in bad circumstances and the intense difficulty of enacting change.,The racial narrative weaves throughout the show as Philo investigates a series of murders of fae that his superiors would rather just ignore. Burge Chancellor Absalom Breakspear (Jared Harris of ,and ,) argues that his country must accept refugees because they’re culpable in creating the fae’s plight. But even he uses the show’s colorful collection of racial slurs and seems to have a hard time telling his fae bodyguards apart. Other politicians use the same rhetoric as Donald Trump or Boris Johnson to argue that the new arrivals are taking jobs from citizens and changing the character of the country. The Burge is largely dominated by Caucasians, but it has some people of color in its elite ranks; at one point, Parliament member Sophie Longerbane (Caroline Ford) invokes her own dark complexion and asks whether discrimination against the fae will eventually be seen as the same as that against other humans. In a twist, she concludes that it won’t because the fae “are nothing like us” and deserve their second-class status.,also doesn’t simplify its setting by making discrimination against the fae the world’s only social problem. Women still have little power in this world, and homosexuality is a crime. While the fae are mostly used as a metaphor for refugees and racial discrimination, there’s also an undertone of queerness led by the casting of Delevingne, who is bisexual and genderfluid, playing a bisexual faerie. That subtext is brought home by a subplot involving a gay doctor who secretly performs abortions and operations to help the half-blood children of humans and fae pass as human.,But the best version of ,’s exploration of discrimination involves a plot that effectively combines ,and ,. When socialite Imogen Spurnrose (Tamzin Merchant) learns that the biggest house in town has been purchased, she plots to catch the new owner’s eye. When the buyer turns out to be a fae named Agreus (David Gyasi), she hatches a Jane Austen-esque plot to save her family from financial ruin by having him pay her to ingratiate him into The Burge’s high society. ,That’s a particularly difficult task since Agreus is equally blunt with bigots who view his arrival with disgust and with condescending liberals who want to hear about the homeland he was happy to leave behind. He’s a toughened pragmatist who’s made his fortune in part by helping humans oppress his own people, and he has little patience or sympathy for fae who are trapped in worse circumstances. His plot has almost nothing to do with the main storyline, but the dynamic between him and Imogen, who grows from one of the show’s most hateful characters to one of its strongest, is so compelling that their scenes stand out even as the rest of the show descends into murder, magic, and mayhem.,It’s also one of the few plots that comes to a satisfying conclusion by the end of season 1. While Philo’s intrigue-heavy investigation starts strong and involves some genuinely surprising twists, it fails to stick the landing as it ends up tangled in the show’s mediocre political drama. Both Sophie and Absalom’s wife, Piety (Indira Varma of , and ,), are meant to be masters of manipulation, but they just come across as pale imitations of Littlefinger and Cersei Lannister, respectively. Their schemes involve a battle for control over Piety and Absalom’s slacker son Jonah (Arty Froushan) who is easily the show’s blandest character. Both he and Sophie are thrust into increased prominence in the season finale, which could make them an even bigger drag on the show’s already-announced second season.,But even when the story lags, the visuals never do. Shot in the Czech Republic, the show is filled with wonder-inspiring setpieces like chase scenes along the roofs of The Burge, battles between men and mythical creatures in the snowy mountains of Tirnanoc, and assaults by the scythe-like zeppelins of The Pact. The costumes and makeup are stunning, giving depth to the portrayals of the fae with touches like different styles of horns and the scarification that marks faerie priestesses and mystics.,There’s plenty of sex in ,often made more spectacular through glowing wings faeries can use to take their intimacy to new heights, but there’s none of ,. Instead, ,s writers trust viewers to keep up with their world-building, regularly dropping terms like “Haruspex” and “mimasery” with almost no explanation beyond the immediate context. That tactic avoids clunky exposition that can bog down genre works, and it also makes the world feel mysterious and largely unexplored, even after eight episodes. It’s a clever technique that could keep viewers engrossed in ,’s mysteries for seasons to come and hopefully give the writers the freedom to continue forging their original identity."

Netflix’s new Dark Crystal reboot reaches back to the gentle fantasy of Fraggle Rock,"
          Aug 30, 2019, 11:20am EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,“The Gorg Who Would Be King,” a 1987 episode of the HBO children’s series ,, and one of the last installments of the show’s original five-season run. The story follows Junior, the prince of his giant-sized race, as he shrinks down to the size of a Fraggle, and gets a lesson from the much smaller species about what it means to be part of a community. Credited to screenwriter Laura Phillips and director Terry Maskell, “The Gorg Who Would Be King” delivers a clear moral message aimed at an elementary-school audience. It’s also a meaningful exploration of ,’s interconnected ecosystem, where Gorgs, Fraggles, and the tiny worker-creatures the Doozers live symbiotically.,Because Netflix is debuting , this weekend.,A prequel to Jim Henson’s 1982 fantasy film ,, the new 10-episode series tells the story of how the planet Thra’s troubles began when a species known as the Skeksis began controlling the world’s mystical forces at the expense of the more peaceful, elfin Gelflings. With a mix of puppetry and CGI — and with an all-star voice cast that includes Mark Hamill, Anya Taylor-Joy, Eddie Izzard, Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, and Simon Pegg — the show offers a richly imagined fantasy universe, as the backdrop to a story with real sociopolitical resonance.,This new , series could restore the reputation of one of Henson’s more troubled projects. A restless artist and a shrewd businessman, Henson figured out as a teenager how to monetize his puppetry, selling his services to local TV stations and advertisers as early as the mid-1950s. By the late 1960s, he was a regular on national network broadcasts, and he leveraged his fame to pitch more ambitious but potentially unwieldy ideas, including the kind of elaborate fantasy epics that would evolve into ,.,The chorus of “no”s Henson heard in response to his more serious pitches partly inspired ,, a hit variety series about underdog entertainers with big dreams. The success of , and , reopened some of the doors that had been closed to Henson. But when he poured a lot of his new clout into ,, the movie was greeted with tepid reviews and merely respectable box office. It found a fervent cult audience, but it wasn’t the blockbuster smash and franchise-starter Henson had hoped for.,Henson found other outlets for his high-fantasy obsessions. In 1983, he and his team launched ,, an expensive international co-production, and one of the first prominent examples of a non-broadcast network (HBO in the US) buying original programming from top talent. Though aimed at kids, the series also appealed to older Henson fans. In ,’s attractively designed and well-thought-out universe, the fun-loving title characters and their Doozer helpers live in a network of caves, nestled between the kingdom of the enormous, galumphing Gorgs and the workshop of a human tinkerer named Doc (and his super cute dog, Sprocket, an astonishingly realistic Muppet creation).,The typical , episode is like a lighter version of ,, with low-stakes quest plots that map out these characters’ delicately balanced culture. In “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” Junior learns that, according to tradition, he’s supposed to become the new ruler when the last leaf falls from the Nirvana tree. He decides to shirk his duty by eating the leaf, but he immediately shrinks. Junior is taken in by the Fraggles — considered little more than garden pests by Gorgs — and his new friends teach him about their way of life where no one’s the boss and instead everyone moderates their friends’ behavior by cracking gentle jokes at their expense whenever they mess up.,Parents of small children and fans of DIY fantasy.,Unlike the all-ages ,, , was aimed at kids just slightly older than a , audience but not old enough for ,. Like nearly all Henson productions, the show features such well-developed characters and nifty-looking puppets (with floppy feather-duster hair) that adults who appreciate fine craftsmanship won’t mind watching along with their youngsters. In “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” Laura Phillips even throws in a Rolling Stones reference when the sentient trash heap Marjory tells Junior, “You can’t always get what you want… but you just might find you get what you need.”,Each episode featured multiple catchy songs; in “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” it’s the snappy anarchist anthem, “You Can Never Be the Boss of Someone Else.” The thoughtfulness of , remains impressive. In this episode, when Pa chastises Junior about his ambivalence toward becoming king, he snaps, “You don’t have to understand the universe; you just have to rule it!” That’s a funny line, in large part because it runs so counter to the Henson studio’s central philosophy. Henson felt the way to make great art — and to live a life of value — was to pay attention to the tiniest details. Everything matters because everything works in harmony.,HBO Go and HBO Now. , is available on Netflix."
The new science fiction series from Cowboy Bebop’s director isn’t that far off from reality,"
          Aug 30, 2019,  2:40pm EDT
        ",D. M. Moore,"The first episode of , — the new anime series, and , director Shinichirō Watanabe — hits Netflix on August 30th. The series is set on Mars, 50 years after humans started living there, in a New York City-like metropolis called Alba City. It’s a futuristic world, but a familiar one as well. Watanabe pulls off an impressive trick here by presenting a world that’s just a little off familiar tech levels, just far enough to seem impressive, without reaching too far into science fiction.,The series follows the titular Tuesday, the daughter of a rich, powerful political family, as she runs away from home and heads to the big city to pursue her dream of being a musician. She’s taken in by Carole, also a young aspiring musician, who makes a living jumping from one short stint at a part-time job to another. The two instantly hit it off and start writing songs together, which is a uniquely strange thing on this futuristic Mars, as no one makes music without at least some help from artificial intelligence.,While the show’s Mars setting allows it to imagine some amazing fictional technology, a lot of what’s on display actually exists in some form today. Here’s a look at how close some of ,’s science-fiction tech is to reality., reporter Dani Deahl explored the field of using artificial intelligence to create music in ,. The idea dates back to at least the 1990s, when David Bowie helped develop a piece of software that reordered lyrics into new combinations to help with writing. More recently, AIs are being designed to generate the instrumental tracks of songs based on data from existing music. As Dani describes it: ,In , the music-making AIs generally seem to be working in tandem with an artist or producer to create a song — except in the case of Tao and Angela, whose story in the show runs parallel to Carole and Tuesday’s. Tao is a wildly successful music producer who builds incredibly advanced AIs to create every aspect of a song, including vocal performances. Tao hires Angela to be the first human he actually makes songs for. The first part of the series reveals that Tao’s programs make songs for her not just based on her vocal range, but on the words she uses and how she behaves. That’s certainly far more advanced than any AI that exists today, but then, it seems pretty advanced for the series’ technology, too.,One of the first pieces of future gadgetry we see (and covet) in the series is Tuesday’s smart luggage. It’s self-propelled, driving itself around to follow her wherever she goes, and is even equipped with little robotic legs to use when it encounters stairs. When it’s stolen, it manages to not get broken into, then finds its way back to Tuesday on its own, indicating that it has some sort of sophisticated tracking system.,A few years ago, smart luggage seemed to be having a moment, with lots of little companies springing up with their own takes on similar gadgets. They ranged from luggage with built-in batteries for recharging your phone to ones a bit more like Tuesday’s that could , to follow their owner around. Some could , through the use of a sophisticated theoretical mesh network of other smart luggage.,But then , any smart luggage that didn’t have removable batteries, and , that complied with the new rule from being loaded on to planes. Which in turn led to a number of , closing. Surprisingly, though, the only really futuristic thing about Tuesday’s luggage is the legs.,Carole’s favorite mode of transport around Alba City is an electric one-wheeled skateboard. While there have been a number of attempts at making , , , over the last few years, Carole’s seems closest in design to ,. Unlike the Pint, though, the fictional version has a hubless motor design for its wheel, and folds up for easy transport when not in use. It is also seems incredibly light, given how Carole is able to carry it one-handed and get pretty significant air clearance off the ground with it.  ,AI seems to be a blanket term in the series, encompassing all sorts of intelligent robots and software that vary greatly in levels of functionality and sentience. Carole has a personable robotic owl AI pet whose main function is as an alarm clock, but it seems to possess some deductive reasoning and problem-solving abilities. There’s also an AI music producer in a robotic dog, which serves as a judge on an ,/ , type music-competition show. The dog also has a distinct personality, and makes jokes like a human judge on a reality competition show. It’s difficult to tell, though, how much of this behavior is sentience, and how much is fakery though programming.,Current actual robotic pets are far less sophisticated than their anime counterparts, at least in terms of range of movement and functionality. Many are less animal-like than Carole’s owl, like the odd-looking toddler robot ,, or the more abstract ,. Neither is as close to the show’s example as ,, though, and that seems to be the design inspiration for the reality show judge’s robotic body.,Aibo is a $1,800 robot dog covered in sensors, which allow it to respond to voice commands and petting. It can use a camera in its nose to recognize people, and send security updates on what’s going on at home. But even with all that, it’s more like a slow-moving, stumbly puppy than something that could pass a Turning test.,The first few large-scale professional concerts in the first part of , actually seem pretty conventional by real-world standards, with giant screens acting as musical visualizers, along with laser and pyrotechnics displays, depending on the style of the band playing. That is until Crystal — apparently a sort of future anime Mars version of Beyoncé — performs while accompanied by a crowd-enveloping flock of holographic birds.,Most modern holographic illusions at concerts use an old illusionist’s technique called ,, which essentially bounces light off a film or glass to produce a transparent ghostly image, like with ,, or the real-world concerts for ,. For last year’s ,, augmented reality tech was used to incorporate virtual characters into a live performance, but this effect wasn’t visible to the naked eye for people attending in person.,The closest real-world equivalent to the effect Crystal has is the Holosphere, which was featured in ,. The two-story-tall sphere is wrapped in strips of LED lights, which effectively turns it into a sort of semi-transparent spherical display. It allows performers inside it to appear as if they’re standing in the center of a giant eyeball, ball of lightning, or whatever designs they configure to map to the sphere. While not technically a hologram, the sphere seems as though it could produce a similar illusory effect as Crystal’s birds, although not to the same audience and stage-circling scope.,A number of restaurants and bars in Alba City are equipped with touch-screen tables and bar tops, allowing tables to become both menus for customers to peruse, and waitstaff for taking orders. The one shown in a pizza restaurant is particularly neat, since it blends back into the restaurant’s aesthetic when not in use, by displaying a wood-panel surface. But it’s more intriguing to see what these screens reveal about labor in ,While a lot of the series’ food and drink ordering and preparation is automated, waitstaff and bartenders can still be called on for a more human experience.,In terms of automated food preparation, last year ,’s Nick Statt ,:,Surprisingly, the screen technology on display in the show seems like it might be more fictional than the robotic food prep. For a while, Microsoft tinkered with making ,, but later repurposed the name for its line of tablets and laptops. Then in 2016, a French company created a ,, which seems as though it could be an ancestor of the ones in the show. The fictional version still looks a bit more like a giant TV laid flat than a table, though, even when it’s off. ,Sony showed off a different approach in 2017 at SXSW, with an overhead projector that could effectively turn any flat surface into a touchscreen display. While that couldn’t have been used at the bar in the anime, conceivably an overhead projector-style device could have created the menu on the table at the pizza restaurant, while also allowing for it to be just a normal wooden table.,After watching the first 12 episodes of this 24-episode show — all 12 of which are now on Netflix  —  it occurred to me that the series’ future technology was directly extrapolated from current trends and devices. That helps speak to one of the show’s major themes — criticizing the idea of removing humans from music creation. To explore that idea, Watanabe needed to create a world where humans didn’t make music, AI did. But he also had to make that world feel relatable to the audience.,And that helps explain the show’s aesthetic. It’s why even though Alba City is about 50 years old and on Mars, it looks like a modern Earth metropolis, with some buildings that look like they date back to the early 1900s. It’s why the characters’ cellphones look like modern cellphones, and have Instagram on them. ,Watanabe did a similar thing with his retro designs on ,That show is also set in Earth’s far future, with humans rapidly traveling from planet to planet ,. But the details of the world look familiar from contemporary 1980s and 1990s film and TV. They’re modified and retrofitted to evoke a much more futuristic world, but they aren’t jarring or alienating. , does the same thing. So little of the world is explained outright, but it doesn’t need justifications and setup, because it looks so close to familiar. It’s easy to look into this world and imagine yourself there — and more, when looking at its clean designs and just-forward-of-present devices, actively wanting to be there."

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"Netflix announced this week that a number of its fall films will have exclusive theatrical runs before they start streaming. This isn’t the first time Netflix has debuted its films in theaters — a few hit theaters first last year, too — but this year’s theatrical slate is much larger and seems to indicate something of a shift in strategy.,This year, Netflix is , ahead of time, up from , (though a fourth was added later). It’ll range from a quiet relationships drama (Noah Baumbach’s ,) to an over-the-top comedy (the Eddie Murphy- led ,) to prestige fare (Martin Scorsese’s ,).,That’s a significant portion of Netflix’s fall film slate, and it includes movies that aren’t necessarily Oscar bait. I can’t say I know exactly what it means. Maybe it’s some kind of concession to theaters or to filmmakers, or maybe Netflix just sees the value of first-week box office dollars and realizes its viewers won’t be too bothered by the delay. Either way, Netflix is changing, and I’m not entirely sure , is for the worse.,Check out 13 trailers from this week below.,I might be alone on this, but hear me out: this idea that , is the conclusion of the trilogy of , trilogies and should, therefore, return to the ultimate bad guy feels... kind of wrong. , and , leaned on the past in some critical ways, but this trilogy’s story has ultimately been Rey versus Kylo, and the past didn’t matter much except as narrative framework.

The movie comes out December 20th.,I continue to be absolutely stunned that this is what DC’s , movie looks like.

        ",Jacob Kastrenakes,"Marvel’s , films have been a standout for me in the MCU. What I think it comes down to is this: they’re not about superhero stuff all that much. It’s all grounded in Peter just trying to figure out life as a teenager, and his journey and failures as Spider-Man reflect that., took a small step away from the very fun high school drama that grounded the first film in this series, but it still stayed rooted enough in that world that it felt more like a genre-infused twist on a road trip movie than a magical powers / save the world kind of film.,These are also films that have understood that having a connection with the villain makes the whole story so much more tense and powerful. I will admit: I don’t think the villain’s scheme in , made any sense at all, but our connection with the character still goes a long way.,Check out eight trailers from this week below.,For a movie with zombie right in the title, there’s surprisingly little zombie action in this trailer.

Netflix removes 13 Reasons Why’s controversial suicide scene,"
          Jul 16, 2019, 12:08pm EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"Netflix has removed a controversial, explicit scene depicting a character’s suicide in its original series ,, two years after the show’s original debut. ,The company cited advice from medical experts and the upcoming launch of the show’s third season as the main reason, according to a statement ,. As more viewers come to Netflix to watch the show, the company said it wants to ensure proper actions are taken to protect fans.,The scene in question was about three minutes in length and originally played halfway through the show’s season one finale. It explicitly depicted the main character, Hannah, cutting her wrists open and bleeding to death. The new version now jumps from Hannah staring at herself in the mirror to her parents dealing with the aftershock of what happened. ,“No one scene is more important than the life of the show, and its message that we must take better care of each other,” showrunner Brian Yorkey said in a statement to ,. “We believe this edit will help the show do the most good for the most people while mitigating any risk for especially vulnerable young viewers.”,This isn’t the first time medical professionals, parents’ groups, and suicide-prevention experts have criticized Netflix and Yorkey for including the scene. Netflix executives were warned by professionals that ,’s,graphic portrayal of suicide went against every guideline on how to handle the delicate subject matter. Still, Netflix and Yorkey left the scene in. Scientists, however, , in teen deaths from suicide following the show’s release.,Authors behind the study , in May acknowledged that because there isn’t conclusive evidence that people who died from suicide during the study period watched ,, it “does not provide definitive proof” that ,is associated with harmful outcomes.” They did note they found the increase in death overall “concerning.” Results from two recent studies have led scientists and healthcare professionals to voice concerns about the show producing a , effect. Researchers have observed that being exposed to suicide or suicidal behaviors either in a person’s personal life, , can cause an increase in suicidal behavior — ,s. ,The American Association of Suicidology, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American School Counselor Association, Dr. Helen Hsu from Stanford, advocacy group Mental Health America, the Trevor Project, and Dr. Rebecca Hedrick from Cedars-Sinai issued a joint statement to ,condoning Netflix’s decision to remove the scene. ,“This positive change will ensure that , continues to encourage open conversation about mental health and suicide prevention — while also mitigating the risk for the most vulnerable teenage viewers,” the statement reads. ,Other parties have questioned Netflix’s decision to remove the scene. While some groups advocated against the scene, others have questioned whether excising it is beneficial. Some argue that losing the scene could actually do more harm. ,“The argument ,glorifies suicide is actually made infinitely stronger by removing the suicide itself,” , Myles McNutt, associate professor of media studies at the University of Wisconsin. “Without showing Hannah’s shock and pain, the ‘suicide as revenge’ plan goes too smoothly. I understand the potential harm of ‘how to’ in showing the suicide, but the way it’s depicted is horrifying, and the story is built in a way that you need that horror.” ,This isn’t the first time Netflix has agreed to alter a scene or change the direction of a series because of public feedback. In March, the company also re-edited its original movie ,, which originally used stock footage of a real-life fatal train derailment to depict a fictional disaster. The company resisted the cut through three months of controversy and criticism, but ,. More recently, the company promised to cut down on scenes that , in light of controversy over the most ,.

Going forward, all new projects that we commission with ratings of TV-14 or below for series or PG-13 or below for films, will be smoking and e-cigarette free.” ,But there’s a difference between eliminating smoking on-screen and altering a show’s central drama. In this case, the overwhelming opinion is that Netflix is doing the right thing, especially considering its younger viewers. Even if it took two years to happen."

Truth Be Told doesn’t know how to make a murderer,"
          Dec  6, 2019,  4:56pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"should be a home run. Its premise — the story of a podcaster revisiting a murder case 20 years after a suspect has been incarcerated — immediately evokes ,The pilot, which showcases what appears to be a coerced minor’s testimony, might as well mention ,by name. These are popular, compelling true crime stories, and ,is out to recreate the thrills of the genre through fiction. , is the latest original series from Apple TV Plus. Poppy Parnell (Octavia Spencer) is a true crime podcaster returning to the case of Warren Cave (Aaron Paul), a man convicted of murdering his neighbor when he was a teenager. Poppy has reason to believe that Warren might be innocent, but she’s also got some skin in the game — it was her reporting that led to Warren’s conviction 20 years ago, a series of stories that made her career. “Doesn’t that mean it’s just a crime story?”,you might ask, and you know what? You’d be right! It’s a crime story, with the reportorial inflection of your favorite nonfiction podcast. I wouldn’t think about it too much, because ,does not. It’d be much nicer if it did. ,Almost immediately, there’s a dissonance between the facts as the show lays them out, and how it considers them. Most glaring is Poppy’s portrayal as directly responsible for Warren’s incarceration, thanks to her reporting — which means she has a stake in this story that wouldn’t pass a journalism sniff test in a million years — but , make for a compelling thriller as Poppy gets more wrapped up in a story she’s far too close to. (Though if Poppy’s reporting helped land Warren in prison and he’s actually innocent, that means,),Unfortunately, , isn’t terribly interested in these ideas, painting the podcast instead as Poppy’s crusade to clear a man who might be innocent. This makes her seem like a completely self-interested jerk instead of the brave reporter the show needs her to be. , instead supplements its central mystery with Poppy’s increasingly complicated family life. Her career as a podcast icon has also lifted her comfortably into the middle class, something that’s making it harder and harder to connect with her less fortunate family. There’s rich drama to mine there, but, like the Cave case, it’s all hamstrung by the show’s perplexing disinterest in making Poppy out as anything other than a hero. ,This bleeds over to ,’s plotting, which doles out twists in its murder mystery as Poppy is about to discover them for herself. There’s very little tension, and that compulsive ‘can’t wait to learn what happens next’ feeling you get from true crime stories in the ,mold is completely missing here. ,It’s a huge shame, not just because the cast seems to be put to poor use — which, in addition to Spencer and Paul, includes Lizzy Caplan and Ron Cephas Jones, all giving perplexingly muted performances — but because , assembles a well-rounded cast of black characters from all walks of life, the main exception being everyone tied to the Cave case. It’s a nice diversion from the overwhelmingly white world of popular true crime podcasts, and one the show does matter-of-factly. ,This hurts the show, both depriving it of desperately needed depth and giving inadvertent absolution , of modern true crime. “In a way, crime stories, true or otherwise, have always been about self-soothing,” writes Andrea DenHoed for , in ,. “It’s a genre whose satisfactions derive largely from the finality of the big reveal, and it’s not, consequently, particularly well equipped to deal with nuance, contradiction, and ambiguity.”,It is unfair to expect ,to single-handedly improve upon, or even account for, the failings of the storytelling genre in which it has situated itself. It’s okay if the show, in emulating those influences, shares their lack of the nuance, contradiction, and ambiguity that DenHoed describes. Unfortunately, it also lacks the base satisfaction of a true crime podcast, the vicarious thrill and morbid compulsion to keep looking at tragedy, to pry further into somewhere we don’t belong. Perhaps the most damning criticism of ,is a simple one: I don’t care whether Warren Cave killed that man or not."
