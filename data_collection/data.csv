I think I complained in one of these columns recently that, upon rewatching ,y, I felt like its animation was underused, barely scratching the surface of what such a dark, trippy film could do with that dreamy style. , gets it right.,The series does a wonderful job of using its dreamy look to tell a story where characters are constantly going in and out of memories, leaving moments behind only to return to them later, mid-conversation. It’s something that could easily be overdone, but the story keeps it all grounded, even as the visuals help to express just how disorienting and occasionally wonderful the feeling of slipping in and out of time can be.,And ultimately, the show’s characters are just so strong and colorful on their own that it’d be worth watching even if people weren’t constantly slipping through time and space. The rotoscoped style could have distanced us, but instead it gives the actors space to be even more expressive, as the scene focuses us on their eyes, mouth, or hands, making simple motions feel large and impactful.,Check out seven trailers from this week below.,J.J.

Netflix miniseries Hollywood isn’t the inspiration it thinks it is,"
          May  5, 2020, 12:36pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"There’s a scene in , for ,, a musical about the life of P.T. Barnum, where Hugh Jackman grins at Zach Efron for saying he does not know what “show business” is. “That’s because I’ve just invented it,” he tells him, cheekily. Like a zombie show where the characters somehow do not know what zombies are, this little bit of irony is fun or grating, depending on the type of person you are. But hardly anyone wants to deal with an entire show full of that. ,, a new Netflix miniseries from Ryan Murphy, is an entire show full of that.,Murphy is perhaps the buzziest maker of television in the business. With this latest project, the writer / director (who co-created the series with frequent collaborator Ian Brennan), who is behind shows like , and , brings his distinct slick, sensational style to the Golden Age of showbiz. Bawdy and transgressive, it starts with a flair and energy that’s hard to look away from, tremendously watchable from minute one. Trouble is, it’s impossible to parse what the show wants to even be ,.  , is an alt-history story about a cast of mostly fictional strivers trying to make it big in 1940s Los Angeles. Just about every core cast member we’re introduced to — writer Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope), director Raymond Ainsley (Darren Criss), actress Camille Washington (Laura Harrier), among others — are from marginalized backgrounds. They’re gay, women, not white, or some combination of the three. They are, by design, people who would have never, ever stood a chance in Old Hollywood, at least not without finding some way to pass. This is the first aim of the show: a rewrite of the well-worn dream-big story, but one starring people who weren’t allowed to be a part of it, and one where they win. ,But the series isn’t just a rosy what-if fable. ,also has ambitions of being a much-needed corrective to our overly simplistic view of the Hollywood that was. The show echoes works like , and the book / documentary ,, offering a look into a more hedonistic side of the Golden Age of show business. This Hollywood was not carefully laundered for mass consumption, a Dreamland where big-name stars had hookups arranged by fixers that conducted business out of a gas station front and secretly gay and bisexual actors and producers threw exclusive parties where they could be secrets no longer. ,In this, the miniseries wants to have its cake and eat it, too. , shows the era for its ugliness — the homophobia, racism, and sexism that shut out marginalized talent for decades — and dreams a new dream where it wasn’t enough to stop our heroes. But its other goal of disabusing viewers of the wholesome myth embodied by the films of the era gets incredibly messy fast. ,Part of the problem is that , is not entirely built around fictional characters. Real names enter and leave the drama throughout, from Hattie McDaniel (Queen Latifah) to Anna May Wong (Michelle Krusiec), real people who did the impossible present to bolster the egos of characters that never existed and therefore, arguably, their creators. Then there’s Henry Wilson (an impressively nasty Jim Parsons), a real-life talent agent who was famous for developing the era’s leading men. He was also, as ,makes , clear, alleged to be the Harvey Weinstein of his day, coercing young men into sex in exchange for parts and stardom. On the show, one of those men is the aspiring actor whom Wilson turns into Rock Hudson — a curious choice since the show barely seems interested in the real Rock Hudson’s biography. ,It’s hard not to see the twin ambitions of , as utterly at odds with each other. The truth-telling of its nastier side inspired by the real version of history undercuts the earnestness of its wish-fulfillment, making it seem cloying and saccharine. In turn, that earnest part of the show makes its forays into Old Hollywood’s real-world underbelly feel exploitative and cheap. There is too much friction between the two for them to build a cohesive whole, and, as a result, the whole enterprise is compromised at best and condescending at worst. ,Like most people involved in the Hollywood of the real world, the characters of , are utterly convinced that everything they’re doing is ,important. They make dreams real, you see, telling stories so that others can see them and be inspired to believe that they can do it, too. We , to have a version of this story where the marginalized succeed because we need them to inspire a more diverse future version of Hollywood so that Hollywood can go on. ,But the show ,wants you to know that it represents a business where abusers thrive, sex can be traded for power, and bigoted men can build systems that protect their interests and extend their reach. That’s just as much a part of show business as the brown kid who gets it in their head that they can make it, matter just as much as the white ones, and become an example that inspires countless others back home. It’s telling that while ,’s marginalized characters find success, its biggest abuser is ambiguously reformed, allowed to stay in the business of dreams after only a few scenes of feeling sorry about it all. ,These are two sides of the same coin: the pernicious reach of the powerful and the inspiring success stories that launder their reputation. In tying the two together once more, the series just props up the old system it thinks it’s subverting. Hollywood’s greatest production has always been Hollywood. "

Mindy Kaling’s new teen sitcom Never Have I Ever is an empathetic exploration of grief,"
          May  1, 2020,  4:15pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"If you told everyone exactly how high school would play out, odds are many would opt the hell out. High school in America is a bizarre and unkind time, a collective coming-of-age story that has as much room for variety as there are people who go through it. ,, a new Netflix sitcom from , creator Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher, takes the broad strokes of high school and gives them new life by centering its story on an Indian-American girl. It’s an absolute delight, one of the most pleasant new binge-watches you can do right now. ,That doesn’t mean the show is all sunshine — , begins with a tragedy when protagonist Devi Vishwakumar’s (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) father Mohan (Sendhil Ramamurthy) suddenly dies, and shortly after, Devi inexplicably loses the use of her legs. (This is all in the first few minutes). As Devi is starting to get used to life without her father and with her disability, her mobility returns, just as curiously as it left. , is the story of Devi’s attempt to return to a normal life, and Devi wants to return with a bang — literally, by losing her virginity to Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet) the hottest boy in school. ,Perhaps this might not strike you as a healthy thing for someone, real or fictional, to do. That would be the point: , isn’t just an Indian-American take on the coming-of-age story, but also a story that takes teen rom-com tropes and turns them into a vehicle for exploring grief. None of this ever takes a backseat to ,’s comedy or its earnest, empathetic storytelling. The show strives to keep its stakes small and focused on Devi and her friends and family, but they’re surrounded by a cast of friends and family diverse and interesting enough to support a much bigger show. ,While each character can’t have a subplot of their own, they’re all afforded the potential for depth. Every character is going through something, experiencing their foundational traumas in real time. The central conflict of the show is Devi’s inability to see this, slowly realizing that the process of dealing with her own extraordinary grief blinds her to what others are experiencing, and that dealing with that grief poorly can also cost her the connections that will help her move on. ,Again: ,is also a very good comedy that consistently delights. There’s clever and fun narration from tennis superstar John McEnroe (there’s a reason for this); a bright, danceable soundtrack that prominently features Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own” in the pilot and stays in that sonic milieu throughout; and it features a cast of wonderfully charismatic young actors. , feels like what would have been a cult favorite in a previous generation of television, a ,-style one-season wonder. But times are very different now, and an Indian-American lead is a refreshing change for this type of show — especially one that might last."
How to be a Rick and Morty fan,"
          May  7, 2020,  9:58am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"After a mid-season hiatus, ,returned on May 3rd with the first of five episodes to close out its fourth season. The series is as good as it’s always been — shockingly crass but also sharp, easily one of the funniest and most inventive shows on television. As a cultural object, however, there have been problems around its fans. You know, they’re terrible.,It’s been ,, fueled by a comment that went viral on Reddit. “You have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty,” the post begins, claiming that much of its humor would go over the average viewer’s head. “People who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase ‘Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,’ which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic ,Like anything so obviously Online, it’s impossible to tell if this post is sincere or satire, but it definitely struck a chord. The fan reputation can be so prevailing that enjoying the show often feels as if you need to be at least a little self-aware in your fandom. When I asked a friend if he watched , a few weeks ago, he replied: “Yes, but wokely.” ,Part of that reputation is earned. , fans have a documented history of being extremely annoying — most notably, when an episode mentioned a discontinued McDonald’s Szechuan sauce and said fans began ,. (When the chain brought back the sauce for a limited time, fans were then upset ,.),But some of that reputation comes from the behind-the-scenes dynamic of the show; in the lead-up to season 2, , noted that there were no women on the writing staff, and creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon made jokes about it in response. ,“They make my wee-wee feel weird,” said Roiland. ,“I blame them for the inflation , the recession at the same time,” Harmon continued to riff. “They don’t ask for directions, and they leave the toilet seat down.”,After chalking it up to oversight, they corrected the writers’ room homogeneity by staffing Jane Becker, Erica Rosbe, Sarah Carbiener, and Jessica Gao in one big spree for the show’s third season. Misogynistic fans reacted predictably with much whining online that quickly gave way to actual harassment, compelling Harmon to ,. (Harmon, it should be noted, has also very publicly confronted ,.) The outrage was further proved baseless and embarrassing when Gao wrote “Pickle Rick,” one of the show’s fan-favorite episodes.,But fandoms don’t spring forth from the ether, and ,’s status as an Adult Swim show is part of the problem. Cartoon Network’s late-night programming block notoriously , for most of its existence, and former creative director Mike Lazzo ,. (Lazzo retired in December 2019.) It’s hard, then, to be surprised when the bulk of its audience isn’t supportive of people the network only showed interest in recently. ,Like working in an excellent cafe with poor ventilation, the stench of that grease clings to you, an unpleasant reminder of what was actually a pretty nice time. It can feel strange to publicly be into a show that has some truly bad fans — but it can be done if you are delicate about it and completely abandon the hard sell. No aggressive superlatives. Don’t call it “the best / funniest / smartest show on television,” even if you have a pretty solid argument for that. No shock and / or surprise that the other party hasn’t seen it yet or doesn’t know about parts that they would really enjoy.,Instead, focus on something specific and work on your noncommittal voice, like you’re trying to sound cool in high school by showing off how much you don’t actually care. Say you like , because it’s weird, and you like being surprised every time you hit play or that you just love trying to spot the voices of the , guest stars that roll through or that you really like gross jokes about farts and genitalia, and you didn’t know how clever someone could be with them until you saw ,. But say it all with a kind of shrug, like what you ,want to say is “just live your truth.”,Given the state of , fandom, this is probably the safest approach to practicing fandom: soft sells only. You don’t have to feel bad about liking it, but you don’t need to express pride in your good taste either. ,Rick and Morty,Hearthstone: Heroes of WarCraft,It can feel annoying to have to adjust your approach to account for the bad behavior of a subset of fans, but the whole point of being a (good, not-toxic) fan of something is sharing something you like with other people, and that means being concerned with how they think and feel first, and then showing them that they might enjoy the same things as you. While bad fans don’t have to be a reason for you to give up on something you like, they are a perfectly good reason for anyone else to not pay attention. ,This is the easiest way to transcend a fandom problem — by being a sort of anti-fan. Be quieter about it, less about “fandom” the concept and more about fandom as one of dozens of tiny connections you have with the things you enjoy. It’s nice to like things! It’s less nice to like them because ,Anyway, you should watch this ,show if you want. Dude turns himself into a pickle. He’s called Pickle Rick. It’s hilarious. No pressure, though. "

Rick and Morty’s Chris Parnell thinks Jerry would do very well in quarantine,"
          May 11, 2020,  9:30am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Chris Parnell is a normcore comedy assassin. After a career in improv,  two stints on ,, and countless roles on sitcoms like , and animated shows like ,, Parnell has perfected the art of using his extremely average appearance — and voice — to deliver disarmingly strange, ridiculous and deadpan comedy. Few are better at making the act of looking like a relatively normal dude and keeping a straight face so , (,).,This is why, as Jerry Smith, Parnell is an essential part of what makes , work. His ability to adopt an aw-shucks affectation even as he bears witness to some of the most bizarre things committed to animation makes him one of the most endearing aspects of the show.,Recently, Parnell spoke with,in a phone call from Los Angeles, where the actor is currently self-quarantined with his family, for a conversation about Jerry’s quarantine odds, ,fans, and what he’s up to during isolation. ,This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.,: You know, every time that I do it after it’s been a long break, I have to find it a little bit, but the voice is not that different than my voice and it’s just sort of tapping into Jerry. But the writing is so good, it’s so much of joy on the page and what the writers create so that it’s really just kind of trying to bring that to life. As long as I’m true to that and being present while I’m recording and all that, it’s not too challenging to get back into Jerry.,Pretty much everything that I do is just solo record sessions, which I enjoy. The hardest thing I think is just remembering to really be present and try to act it well and not just kind of say the lines. So there’s a fair bit of visualization going on in my head and trying to sort of put myself in that place and see it. And it’s very freeing in that there’s no camera on me, so it doesn’t matter what I’m doing with my hands and arms and the way I’m gesticulating or whatever, which I do a fair bit of when I record voiceover. So you’re really just taking all of this energy and funneling it through your voice without being able to see anything which you’re doing physically. Although, obviously, what I do physically with my face and my body is going to affect how my voice sounds.,But yeah, I mean, I feel lucky that I get to do both things. Both the live action and the animated stuff. Obviously, these days it tends to be mostly the animation, but I get to do enough guest star appearances on sitcoms or the occasional movie part or things like that. I get to have that one-on-one interaction with other actors actually with us looking at each other and saying things to each other, so that’s very nice to get to do both.,Would I? Sure. I mean, I probably have at some level. I mean, I’ve certainly done a lot of characters that are ,.,I don’t think so, honestly. Not to be Mr. Tough Guy, but when you’ve had a background doing The Groundlings like I have and once you do live improv shows and stuff like that, there’s really... almost anything goes. And then ,. I mean, people who have been a part of comedy for an extended period of time, as I’ve been fortunate enough to be, for the vast majority of us anyway, there’s not really much that shocks us. Part of doing comedy is doing things that are shocking and surprising and ridiculous, so I don’t know I’ve ever actually encountered anything with Jerry that I was like, “Oh boy. Wow.”,I don’t interact with fans a lot mainly because I’m not on social media, and the only real time for that interaction is at the occasional convention, like Comic-Con or whatever that Adult Swim will send us to. And that’s awesome and that’s really fun and that’s a great time to get to see the crowd react to the screening of an episode or in doing a panel and hearing their questions, so it becomes tangible in a way that it’s not usually. ,But I actually find it freeing to not have to try to do something for an immediate audience reaction and just sort of hope that what I’m doing is funny or whatever it’s supposed to be. And once it’s all put together and animated — obviously, the animation is a big part of it — that people will react in a good way and laugh at [Jerry]. I don’t mind not having that immediate reaction, in a strange way.,I don’t, really. I mean, occasionally I’ll hear that somebody is being nasty or misogynistic or something, but I don’t... other than the broad colors like that. I know that’s very much the minority, but yeah, I don’t have a huge sense of what it’s like.,Yeah? I believe that. ,Well, Rick is fairly amoral. He makes a lot of questionable or outright terrible choices, so I guess there’s going to be people that relate to that in a very particular way and sort of revel in that. ,Any time people get really excited and, dare I say, rabid about something, there’s probably going to be some nastiness involved — and also just inherent in, obviously, social media and people communicating without having to be looking at somebody face to face. Then maybe just the nihilistic nature of , and the darkness of it sort of brings something extra out of some of the fans.,My sons are six and three, so they don’t watch ,, even though they do have some of the plushies and little hard plastic figurines. I mean, my six-year-old knows who Mr. Poopy Butthole is, you know? Other than watching the show with my wife and the bit of feedback I get from her, but we don’t really take the show apart or anything. I’m not sure if my sister watches it. My parents definitely don’t. ,Well, I think Jerry would actually do pretty well with it. I think he would just find some little projects to engage himself with and focus on those and feel proud of his little victories he might have. I know he’s going to be taking up, on some level, beekeeping in these upcoming episodes. So yeah, I don’t think it would be too rough on Jerry. ,Well, I’m on the fourth book of the , series by Dan Simmons. I don’t know if you know that at all, but it’s a great, great science fiction series. I mean, just extraordinary. So I’m making my way through the fourth and last book of that series, and then my wife and I, we have to find shows that we both want to watch at night after the kids are in bed. We love John Oliver, like so many people do. We love Bill Maher and Samantha Bee, we’re fans of hers, and we also watch ,and ,. My wife turned me on to those shows back many years ago, and so, although I never thought I’d be watching reality TV, I do. I am now invested slightly in the lives of those women.,Yeah. Yeah. A lot of it I cannot watch. Like, I have no interest in , or certain shows where I just feel like people are not particularly interesting, but yeah. And then lately my wife’s been having these sort of meetups with some of the other ladies in our neighborhood where they’ll just sit out on the street in lawn chairs and keep their distance, their social distance, and chat.

Quibi currently has about 3.5 million app downloads and 1.3 million active users, according to Katzenberg. ,That’s a far cry from Disney Plus’ , and YouTube’s more than 2 billion monthly users, 70 percent of which ,.

But the movie also takes the course a lot of true-story movies do, where they worry more about telling you what happened than they do about building characters.,I think this works to a point. It’s a wild story, and they do an entertaining job telling it. But I wish the film pushed a little further into who these people are.

While HBO Max won’t be the exclusive home — shows will run on both HBO Max and Crunchyroll at the same time — subscribers will have more access to popular anime.,Although these are just a smattering of titles compared to the 1,000-plus series on Crunchyroll, the hope is to “introduce anime to a wider audience who appreciates compelling stories told through this dynamic medium,” according to Crunchyroll’s general manager, Joanne Waage. ,It’s a win-win for the two streaming platforms, both owned by AT&T. If mainstream audiences subscribing to HBO Max develop an affinity for anime being provided through Crunchyroll, they could potentially sign up for the anime streaming service in addition to HBO. (Crunchyroll currently has more than 2 million paid subscribers.) HBO Max can also tout an impressive anime offering at launch, with a consistent funnel for future content. WarnerMedia will also use HBO Max as the exclusive home for Studio Ghibli’s films in the United States, as Netflix secured the international rights to the popular and critically acclaimed films. ,Both Netflix and Amazon have spent millions of dollars investing in developing new original anime series and licensing top titles. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings expressed , that anime was a core area Netflix wanted to invest in.

HBO is teaming up with Scener to give subscribers the ability to watch TV together,"
          May 14, 2020,  9:00am EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"People stuck in quarantine who might want to watch ,or ,with friends and family have the option to do so using Scener. ,, an online video chatting tool that allows people to sign in to their Netflix accounts to watch movies and TV shows with friends who also subscribe to the services, is adding HBO to people’s viewing options. Anyone with an HBO Now or HBO Go subscription in the United States can boot up the streaming service, create a private virtual theater for up to 20 people, and watch any title. Scener marks the first major partnership between WarnerMedia’s HBO network and an online co-viewing platform. ,Joe Braidwood, Scener’s co-founder, knew that finding an easy way to give people the ability to stream and hang out with their friends online that also worked within the fragile copyright rules crucial to studios and streamers was important. Braidwood just “didn’t predict it would be a pandemic that makes it mainstream,” he told ,“When the pandemic hit, we saw a crazy surge in demand for our product,” Braidwood added. ,It wasn’t long after that various shelter-in-place orders went into effect around the United States. As more people stayed home, WarnerMedia reached out to Scener about a partnership. Scener and WarnerMedia started working together in March. The new partnership accompanies a new design for the site, including a recent update that helps to  ease the stress on Google Chrome browsers running the app.,“We used to overlay the video and social channels, which injected a lot of code at once leading to a lot of stability issues in Netflix,” Braidwood said. “People were running out of memory because so much was happening on one Chrome tab.”,Since the update’s rolled out, Scener’s received a wave of positive feedback. Something it was hopeful for as usage started skyrocketing was seeing active usage increase 15 times on the legacy product, he said. Having HBO on board was added pressure. Co-watching isn’t a new concept, but “the approach that we take is a very safe and compatible with HBO’s vision,” Braidwood said. HBO, a network that deals with its most popular shows winding up on piracy sites hours after episodes air, wants to ensure that subscribers have the opportunity to watch shows with their friends they can’t see, but not at a cost to their network. ,Piracy is, of course, an issue that Hollywood studios and networks think about, but so does Braidwood. Sites like Twitch often play host to pirated content being streamed by individual users. It’s how some ,, one of HBO’s most successful series. Twitch works to take them down, but on Sunday nights when ,was airing, there seemed to be a new stream for every one removed. ,Part of the appeal of watching a show or movie on Twitch and over Discord is socialization through chat. Braidwood thinks of the current moment like the music industry. Napster became a problem the industry was forced to figure out, and part of the solution came in the form of Spotify. ,“It wasn’t until Spotify’s delightful UX and revenue split that the industry started to move past that problem,” Braidwood said. “Yes, people download and pirate movies, and streaming them on Discord and Twitch, but the majority of people don’t have the time or the patience for that. They want a delightful, easy experience.” ,Scener isn’t the only company trying to get ahead of the co-viewing trend. Amazon, which owns Twitch, is letting streamers , that are available on ,, the company’s streaming service. Everyone who wants in on the party has to subscribe to Amazon Prime, similar to how people who use Scener have subscriptions to Netflix, HBO Now, or HBO Go. Studios and streaming platforms are looking at co-viewing now more than ever because the pandemic has created an increase in demand, but Braidwood doesn’t think co-viewing will only stick around while people are at home. ,“There are watershed moments in history where black swan events change human behavior; that couldn’t be more true for America right now,” Braidwood said. “This is one of the first milestones that starts tracking the new path of co-viewing becoming more than just a trend. We think the sky’s the limit.”"

        ",Joshua Rivera,"The most upsetting thing about ,is that it’s already over. Netflix’s latest bingeable show is a limited series, an eight-episode run about a jazz club in Paris. Produced by Academy Award-winning ,and ,director Damien Chazelle (who directed the first two episodes) and written by acclaimed playwright Jack Thorne, ,y feels like it brings something truly new to the , original series the streaming giant has cultivated of late, and it’s one of the most visually rewarding shows in your queue this year. ,The series follows Elliot (André Holland, terrific) as he struggles to keep his jazz club, The Eddy, afloat during a particularly bad time. His house band is on the verge of getting signed, but bad luck keeps getting in the way. His daughter, Julie (Amandla Stenberg), is now living with him after a bad time with her mother in the States, and she’s acting out. There’s a famous producer interested in his band, but he’s flighty, and the band needs some work. And then his partner, Farid (Tahar Rahim), is murdered.,That last bit is easily the worst thing about ,. The show follows this murder plot through its entirety, grafting a half-baked crime drama onto a superb European hangout. Everything that the series might need from a shocking death — an avenue to explore grief and fuel for character implosions — could conceivably be achieved by replacing Farid’s murder with any other sort of unexpected death. That it chooses to commit so fully to this plotline is baffling, with many scenes of cops and heavies and menacing phone calls just rudely making a mess of what’s otherwise extremely good. ,Sometimes, when writing about TV, you have to be careful to avoid criticizing a series for not being what you want it to be, instead of what it is. , sincerely seems like it wants to be a meandering tale that’s mostly about nothing, just hardscrabble music lovers feeling things and making self-destructive choices on a small scale. Why spend an episode on the bassist who suffers through a day as the third wheel between his former love and her new beau? Or another on a singer’s struggle with her self-worth, caught between two men who want to use her talents to advance their careers and a mother who has never even heard the word “boundaries” in her life? Why film Paris so unromantically, with a wonderful, lived-in feeling, with characters that flow from English to French to Arabic? Why work so hard to marry these tiny dramas to such fantastic music? ,And yes, in keeping with Damien Chazelle projects like ,and ,, , is incredibly good at visually conveying what it feels like to perform music: to be in it and making it at once. In directing the first two episodes, Chazelle sets a standard for this that isn’t ,consistently met throughout — you will notice later episodes dial back his frenetic energy a bit — but they all understand what music , to these characters and work hard to make sure you do, too. ,Above all else, , is a show to be experienced. It’s a shame that its gritty crime plot feels like it comes from a different show entirely — one that wants to shock and pull you from one episode to the next, instead of trusting you will simply flow there with the current. But it’s a small price to pay for some wonderful, textured television. "

The list of reasons to appreciate the show is long: it’s one of the warmest you can watch, full of love and empathy for nearly every person on-screen. It’s very funny, with cold opens that often leave you laughing within 30 seconds. And it’s completely beholden to its own interests, with each episode being an entirely different, lovely experience. Currently in the middle of its fourth season, , is a fantastic showcase for co-creator and star Pamela Adlon, who faced the unenviable task of contending with co-creator Louis C.K.’s admission of sexual misconduct between the show’s second and third seasons.

In ,, creator Donald Glover and his collaborators have crafted a vehicle where anything can happen, and they can do whatever they want, from “Teddy Perkins,” an astonishing and unsettling episode about a Michael Jackson analog to an episode about a party Drake throws where Drake never appears.

As a choreographer and director, the former was known for changing Broadway forever behind the scenes, and as a dancer and actor, the latter was the face of that change. The reality of their dynamic was more complicated and involved than that, and while , is a bit shy when it comes to showing the fruits of their relationship — dancing, mostly— the series is a soulful, compelling look at two titans of show business struggling to hold their lives together when they weren’t putting on a show. ,One of the greatest missed opportunities in television, ,is a dramedy about two pals, Hank Dolworth and Britt Pollack, who work together as unlicensed private detectives in a San Diego beach town.

The show attracted actors that were both already famous and a few years out from blowing up: Forest Whitaker, Glenn Close, Anthony Anderson, and Michael Peña all show up for varying lengths of time, each contributing to the tension in a different way. Uncompromising and raw, , ended too late to be adored as a nostalgic classic but also too early to benefit from a streaming glow-up like ,.

Little Fires Everywhere wants you to know it’s definitely about race,"
          Mar 20, 2020,  2:42pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"In ,, people are constantly talking about how they would never “make something about race.” They often say it with shocked indignation — they don’t ,, how could you , that? — because they think of themselves as good people, in the way only wealthy white folks can. You know the kind of people who describe themselves as “comfortable?” , is a show about that very specific demographic, and what happens when their carefully constructed world starts to tear at the seams. People are challenged with the notion that maybe they aren’t as progressive and open-minded as they think they are. ,Hulu’s adaptation of Celeste Ng’s excellent novel is set in Shaker Heights, a real-life suburb of Cleveland. Taking place in the ‘90s, the story follows the well-to-do Richardson family, outlining the events that would lead to their house being burned down by their youngest daughter, Izzy (Megan Stott) — the event that kicks off the show. The eight episodes (the first three are out now, the rest weekly) that follow illustrate how the Richardsons got here, starting with the arrival of Mia Warren (Kerry Washington) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood), two people who get hopelessly tangled in the Richardsons’ lives, inadvertently exposing their worst traits. ,Mia, an artist, leads an itinerant life and has arrived in Shaker Heights with the hopes of giving Pearl a stability they’ve never had together. She leases an apartment from the Richardsons, and over time, she and Pearl slowly become more integrated in their daily life. Pearl attends the same school as the four Richardson children, befriending middle son Moody (Gavin Lewis) and pining after his older brother Trip (Jordan Elsass). Meanwhile, misfit Izzy begins to strike up a relationship with Mia, as Mia and Elena Richardson, the family matriarch, become increasingly wary of the influence each has on the other’s children. ,From here, , slowly starts to simmer, putting each of its cast of privileged white characters in situations that gradually escalate until they are forced to finally ditch their preferred euphemisms. Each encounter exposes another way in which they believe themselves to be good and decent because they’ve built a world where their sense of selves are not challenged. Elena’s daughter Lexie thinks herself virtuous for dating a black classmate, Brian, although she swears it doesn’t enter the equation. Elena hires Mia as her housekeeper, willfully ignorant of the race and class dynamics at play by hiring someone who pays her rent. Bill Richardson (Joshua Jackson), Elena’s husband, admonishes her for not getting a background check before offering the apartment to Mia. Elena, repeatedly, compliments herself for what a , she’s doing by helping the Warrens. ,Over and over again, the Warrens collide against the polite racism of those who pride themselves as not racist, and those small collisions slowly build to something catastrophic, as a friend of the Richardsons adopts a Chinese baby whose mother suddenly resurfaces, demanding her child back. It’s a crisis that compels the people in it to directly say what they’ve spent their lives talking around, and the results are not pretty.,While , has its sights set squarely on being a withering takedown of petty suburban class dynamics, it’s also remarkably understanding of the people within it. While its heart lies with the Warrens, every major player is considerably complicated. Elena Richardson is perfectly played by Reese Witherspoon — every passive-aggressive action cheerily delivered, and every boundary violation couched in the language of good intentions. As deft as the characterization is, the series is also interested in the forces that produce it — how a woman’s ambitions are stifled by societal pressures, and how she ultimately can end up reinforcing the boundaries that initially penned her in. ,That depth extends in every direction — Mia, as played by Kerry Washington, is a quiet force of nature, slowly realizing that she has just enough leverage to upend the neatly ordered worlds of the people who don’t know how much power they indiscriminately wield. As her past becomes less of a mystery, viewers begin to understand why she would apply that pressure. Through Pearl, Mia’s heartbreak is felt when the fault lines that she sees are clearly exposed for the first time. Through each of the Richardson children, the costs of perpetuating the life their parents made for them begin to manifest in unexpected ways. ,This is what , most clearly conveys: there are no easy answers, but there are people who benefit from the questions that go unasked. And when things get hard, there will always be people who have the option to make good choices and those who do not. Most times, the world counts on these questions going unasked, under the guise of manners.

Tiger King is a show about how the internet eats us all,"
          Apr  1, 2020,  1:15pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera," is one of the strongest contenders for most watchable TV show of the year, and it’s a problem. A documentary miniseries comprising seven quick episodes, each under an hour, you could watch the whole thing in a weekend; given the subject, you’ll probably finish even faster. ,The Netflix series follows a man both larger than life and smothered by it: Joe Exotic, the one-time owner of a successful-seeming private zoo with over 200 tigers and other big cats. He’s a man who ran for president of the United States, then governor of Oklahoma, and then sometime after, may have tried to hire someone to kill his nemesis, a woman dedicated to shutting his zoo down. It’s incredibly compelling, and terribly so: ,is almost wholly dedicated to spectacle, with little interest in any sense of truth. And the truth is about as gutting as , is sensational.,As the eponymous Tiger King, Joe Exotic is magnetic: a ball-capped, mulleted man who swaggers with a knee brace and a drawl, wearing some combination of fringe vests, chaps, and bedazzled shirts at all times. You’ve never seen anyone on television like him. Born Joe Schreibvogel, the man’s eccentricities are accompanied by a tragic backstory that ,will deliver piecemeal and in passing. For the first few episodes, we meet him more or less fully formed: a man who has built a small empire with his larger-than-life personality and his equally large cats — an empire that, somehow, crumbled and landed him in prison. ,Every minute of , yields some new surprise, an unbelievable turn or charismatic stranger with incredible stories to tell. The documentary plays fast and loose with these anecdotes, as Joe Exotic shows us how he married two men at once, went into business with a guy who snuck tiger cubs into Vegas casinos, or nearly got mauled by one of his own lions. With no warning, the show also veers into immensely dark territory, as its subjects recount manipulative and abusive relationships, a death by suicide, and Joe Exotic’s sustained hate campaign against Carole Baskin, an activist committed to ending big cat ownership in America whom Joe Exotic also believes killed her wealthy husband for money.,As , goes on, its greatest strength — the litany of unbelievable stories it has to share — becomes its most concerning weakness, as the filmmakers don’t really seem to be interested in telling a story about its subjects as they are in milking them dry. There’s little point to , beyond its sensational thrills and credulously presenting everyone it puts in front of a camera. The show does not, for example, present any context for how seriously you should take the allegation that Carole Baskin killed her husband — so now this allegation is fodder for viral tweets, , for the , , that happens to have real-world fallout: new leads in case of Baskin’s missing ex-husband are being ,. ,It’s likely that you will watch , and wonder if there’s more to the story, and you’d be right. A cursory search for facts will likely lead to , feature about the tangled histories of Schreibvogel and Baskin, reconstructing their early lives and detailing their rivalry. Laid out in print, the story is far more sobering than the occasional flashes of somber distress we get on the show. Both Schreibvogel and Baskin are reportedly victims of abuse, dogged by misfortune and embraced by strange circumstances. Truth is elusive in both of their lives; Schreibvogel appears to be a serial fabulist, and Baskin’s public persona has a singular focus, with few public associations beyond the cats she keeps on her preserve. In their orbits, lives are destroyed — the overwhelming number of them sacrifices dedicated to the myth of the Tiger King.,There’s a level of complicity to viral fame that’s hard to square with shows like ,. In the streaming era, interest is often the result of direct action. There’s very little passivity left in how we entertain ourselves. We choose what to watch, what to recommend, and who to listen to, so if something like , is a viral hit, it , organic, like something we’re all talking about because we’re genuinely interested in it. ,Because of this, , becomes content that generates , content on websites and social media, which, in turn, leads more people back to ,. This, then, eventually leads to the extremely online becoming amateur sleuths and flooding Florida tip lines about a decades-old murder case. Through this cycle, suffering becomes sport — something that can be said of a lot of true-crime media — but also a call to action. ,It can be seen in the way the , encourages listeners to adopt a vindictive view of the role of law enforcement or in the entire cottage industry spun out of ,’s first season, which birthed an entertainment empire around the guilt or innocence of Adnan Syed. It’s a phenomenon fueled by our need to seek resolution where there often is none to be found. In the absence of finality, we post into the infinite. The tyranny of the internet bleeds into the real world: if there’s enough content, eventually, that content becomes real life. We are consumed by the tiger king. "
"There is hope for Westworld, but you’re going to have to stick it out","
          Mar 16, 2020,  3:05pm EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"built a reputation on being mysterious. This made the first season irresistible, the second incomprehensible, and the forthcoming third season... well, you might have some questions — including “Is it still confusing?” “Who is a robot again?” and “Wait, is that Marshawn Lynch?” These are excellent questions. Some of the answers are good; some of them less so. ,In its third season premiere, the show does very little to catch new viewers up to speed, so here are the broad strokes: Westworld, the show’s eponymous park, is one of several theme parks where astonishingly lifelike robots populate re-creations of various historical periods. For a very large price, the wealthy can come and roleplay the fantasy of their choice for a spell, tourists for whom morality is completely optional and hedonism is encouraged — because, after all, the robots (called “hosts” here) aren’t real people. ,Season 1 was about complicating that, as the hosts of Westworld developed consciousness and became aware of the atrocities their creators forced them to live through over and over again. Season 2 was about revolution, as the hosts began to fight back and tear down the park around them. Throughout both, there are running threads tied to the elite who run and attend the park. This mostly related to an internal power struggle within Delos (the corporation that owns Westworld and its sister parks) and teasing that the actual purpose of Westworld is not entertainment but data: a perfect psychological profile of all the elite guests who visit it, built using their unfettered behavior in the parks. ,Unfortunately, this summary (and any summary, really) leaves out , by necessity because , is perhaps the most over-plotted show on television, obsessed with nonlinear storytelling, symbology, constant references to literature and philosophy, and regular plot twists or status quo shifts. It would be nice if the third season was a clean break that let viewers ignore it completely because catching up is exhausting. To a certain extent, you can! But as things begin to unfold, you’re probably going to need to open a wiki. ,The show’s third season begins with Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), the Westworld host who began the robot revolution, out in the real world and eager to enact revenge on her creators. From the four episodes provided to critics in advance, this seems to be the glue holding the season together: what does Dolores’ revenge look like? Which other hosts are out in the real world now? Who are her targets and why? It’s easy enough stuff, and it’s compelling to watch, too. While the show is named after a theme park that made for a fun setting, , slowly began to flesh out what the real world looked like and exploring that world is the best part of these early episodes. ,A big reason for this is that our guide to this world isn’t Dolores but Caleb (Aaron Paul), a disillusioned construction worker and veteran. He’s forced to pick up gig work via an app best described as “Taskrabbit but for crimes” in order to pay for his mother’s hospital bills. Through Caleb, we see this gilded cyberpunk world through working-class eyes, and few eyes are as good at charismatically conveying constant internal suffering than Paul’s. ,Things get more unwieldy as the show sprawls outward from there, catching the viewers up on who survived the massacre at the conclusion of last season and what their status is. The show does this at a languid, perplexing pace, sometimes grabbing your attention with an alarming twist, and in others, it falls back on its cryptic ways. There is, however, a glimmer of hope: by the end of the fourth episode, these seemingly disparate threads come together. The show seems to have a sense of purpose it has not had since its pilot. ,Early in its run, ,invited a lot of comparisons to video games. It made sense on multiple levels: the show was about a park that adhered to a game-like narrative design, and  it cared about detailing the push and pull between the desires of players, designers, and the emergent behavior of the system itself. Pull the lens back more, the way , season 3 does, and the metaphor continues to work astonishingly well. The games built by the characters of , are, like many of the biggest video games, power fantasies. Crucially, they’re power fantasies that map onto the inequality of the world: where labor is not valued, laborers are barely treated as human, and the innovations of science and technology disproportionately benefit the wealthy. ,But as Dolores notes at one point, these are all the products of systems, and systems are more fragile than the people who made them think. It’s a turn that has taken on a strange prescience given the rapidly changing state of the world due to a pandemic, shocks to said systems have a way of exposing just how much inequity is wholly unnecessary, perpetuated simply because there are profits to be made in sustaining it. To refer back to ,’s favorite paraphrasing of Shakespeare: violent delights have violent ends. "

"Amazon Prime Video now allows in-app rentals and purchases on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV","
          Apr  1, 2020,  3:22pm EDT
        ",Nick Statt,"Amazon’s Prime Video iOS and Apple TV apps now let customers make in-app purchases, including renting and buying films and TV shows. The change marks a huge shift in Amazon’s approach to the App Store, which mandates a 30 percent cut on all in-app purchases. ,Prior to the change, Amazon would not allow you to rent or buy content on the Prime Video app, instead, directing users to a web browser to avoid the App Store fee. You could still sign up for a Prime Video subscription through the iOS app if you are not an Amazon Prime subscriber, but even then, you could not make individual content purchases from within the app. ,Now, when users log in to the Prime Video app, there should be a message reading, “Browse, rent, or buy new release movies, popular TV shows, and more — now within the app.” (Big thanks to George Watson, who tipped us off to this change.) ,The prices do not appear to have been raised to account for the 30 percent fee, as ,. It was not immediately clear whether Amazon reached a deal with Apple or whether it is indeed deciding to pay the full cut. But Apple has since confirmed that it entered Amazon Prime Video into an established program for “premium” video providers. ,“Apple has an established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers to offer a variety of customer benefits — including integration with the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on,” Apple said in a statement given to ,. “On qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Atlice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.” ,Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ,In the new Prime Video app, which does not require an update, there’s now a full-blown store tab at the bottom. It features lists of popular and new movies to buy or rent, including many of the recently released films like ,and , that were in theaters in February and March but ,. ,According to user reports and Apple’s statement, Amazon is processing purchases using its own stored payment methods and through its own processor so long as a user has an Amazon account with that information on file. That’s a notable change in how all forms of in-app purchases have been handled before. ,Typically, Apple takes its 30 percent fee and handles all payment, processing, and security upfront — Apple takes only 15 percent from subscriptions so long as a customers signed up for the services within the iOS app and has maintained it for more than a year. ,According to app developer Guilherme Rambo, the Prime Video app began using a special request related to payment processing that first suggested an arrangement between Amazon and Apple, prior to Apple confirming the new program.,According to ,’s Mark Gurman, the deal struck between Amazon and Apple is not a wholly unique one; it’s been in place for some time although it is unclear when it was started. The program allows a company to use its own payment methods, Gurman says, and it’s already in use by apps from more niche premium video providers like Altice One and Canal+. ,Gurman, in a , published after the change, later explained that the program also extends to supporting a number of Apple apps, services, and features — including the “Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on,” according to Apple’s statement.,Regardless of how long this program has existed and the exact terms of the deal that was struck between the two companies, the change should remove a long-lasting headache to buying and renting movies and shows through Amazon’s app and on Apple TV. ,Bloomberg"
"Quibi’s shows are fun, familiar, and a little forgettable","
          Apr  6, 2020,  8:42am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"It’s far too easy to make fun of Quibi. That’s the first problem. You can start with the name: an overly cute mashup of “quick bites.” It’s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to — hence a bizarre , dedicated to explaining it. It’s Netflix, but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt, yet brief enough that you wouldn’t turn to anything but your phone. You know: waiting in lines, pausing to sip a coffee, sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something. That’s Quibi’s second problem: it was created for a world that doesn’t really exist anymore, one put on hold by a pandemic. ,This makes Quibi a harder sell. TV to watch while you’re doing something else doesn’t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on. However, the contrary can , be true: we’re all staring at our phones anyway, so what’s another reason to do it some more? As of today, there are 24 reasons, each Quibi show delivered in installments of 10 minutes or less, each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream. There are 72 snacks in search of a meal.,The content — normally a crass word for art but an apt one for Quibi — runs the gamut, with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven’t really seen before. There’s a , revival starring Chance the Rapper, a series called , where Offset is really into cars and car stunts, a remake of ,starring Liam Hemsworth, and ,, a truly bizarre show where Will Arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the YouTube clip yourself. ,(,The Verg,Polygon,Verge,.),Quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone; almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations. I checked this, incessantly, with every show I watched. There’s something mind-boggling about it, the way Quibi tries to have things literally both ways. It works well enough, but there are strange side effects. In scripted shows, the dual-composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time, and that can make a serious drama feel shallow. In unscripted shows, this adds a layer of uncanniness, as slick network production clashes with a visual composition that’s thoroughly associated with influencers and lo-fi meme makers. You can, ironically, gauge how good a Quibi show is by how well it plays in vertical orientation. ,The majority of Quibi’s programming is the sort of stuff you can find on regular TV, just broken up into smaller pieces. , is a reality show in the vein of , in seven-minute chunks. , , feels like a USA drama, delivered one plot development at a time. , actually , a TV show long before Quibi, but someone figured it might play better if you didn’t have to spend 30 minutes with it. (They were right.) ,Quibi’s best shows are the ones that feel most like they could only happen on Quibi. There’s not a lot of that in the launch lineup, but perhaps the best example is ,, a ,-style courtroom show in which Chrissy Teigen is a courtroom judge mediating exclusively petty disputes, like who got someone a better Lizzo-themed sweater. It’s the perfect Quibi show — like a TikTok that got a little out of hand, but it ends just before it stops being funny. ,Another, ,, features comedians Matt Rogers and Dave Mizzoni as hosts in a competition. In every episode, two different straight men will compete to see who is the better queer ally. Again, it’s a bit that’s perfectly pitched for the platform. It’s savvy and effective, with stunts loud enough to hold your attention and talent deft enough to keep it. (It also might be the most genuinely funny show on Quibi so far.),Documentaries also fare pretty well on Quibi. The standout is ,, about LeBron James’ I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, which serves at-risk children with an approach that’s equal parts social work and education. Compelling, frank, and moving, each eight-minute installment absolutely flies by. ,Still, there’s a frivolousness to Quibi that none of its programming can seem to shake because the platform was built for frivolity. I could put on a Quibi show and keep up with it just fine while writing a grocery list, chopping garlic, or brushing my teeth and only glancing at it. Once, I almost put on a Quibi show while watching something else on my TV. ,For this reason, Quibi’s best point of comparison is podcasts, not streaming TV. It’s a medium for filling space that you probably already had filled with something else, but for some reason, you got it in your head that you should be , something in that time. It exists in a nebulous space between the steady dopamine rush of TikTok’s constant supply of novelty and the chill, lackadaisical time-sink of Twitch. Boredom is the constant, and it’s most often resolved by habit. This then, is the platform’s biggest ask: can you change your habits to accommodate it?,Because Quibi is designed to be habitual. New episodes are scheduled to drop every day, and new shows will premiere “every single Monday,” per Quibi. It’s a steady stream of quick bites coming from an endless bag of treats. Even in a world shut down by circumstance, Quibi is an interesting idea, one that wants us to use our phones the way we already do, like fidget spinners with Wi-Fi or a smoke break we can take anywhere. But that’s the third problem: no one remembers a snack. They remember a really good dinner. "

It’s a wonderful movie about two women slowly growing closer together over the course of about a week that they’re forced to spend together.,The movie revolves around painting, as the title suggests, but the film also does some really fascinating things with music. There are three moments in the movie where music plays, and in all three cases, you don’t see its origin (a piano, singers, an orchestra) until well after the music begins, if at all. It creates a very strange, untethered feeling. Is this sound really happening, or is it part of the score?

Tales from the Loop turns small-town America into a sci-fi feelings machine,"
          Apr  6, 2020, 10:50am EDT
        ",Joshua Rivera,"is so pretty it breaks your heart. Based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, famous for his scenes of pastoral tranquility draped around uncanny sci-fi sights, ,’s newest drama is a collection of eight short stories where everyday rural life is tinged with the supernatural. But unlike, say, ,, where the otherworldly takes center stage, , uses it as an excuse to dig deeper into the people who must continue to live mundane lives, even as the extraordinary looms just inches away. ,While , features a recurring cast of characters and overlapping plots, each episode functions as a standalone short story. Since critics were sent three out-of-order episodes for review, it’s safe to assume that continuity isn’t really a concern for the show; just consider it , with every episode set in the same town. ,And what a town it is! The series takes place in a fictional Ohio neighborhood built above The Loop, a machine built to “explore the mysteries of the universe.” The Loop is massive, and, while it employs most of the residents who live above it, few know the full extent of what goes on within its confines. All they know is that the work done there has changed the texture of their lives. Some of these changes are overt and intentional, like advances in technology that make robotic limbs, hovering tractors, and walking mechs commonplace. ,Other phenomena are less intentional: strange, inexplicable sightings; objects that appear out of thin air; fluctuations in space and time. In the ecosystem of this small Midwestern town, The Loop is an invasive exotic, reshaping the balance of life and nature around it. And everyone there has to just roll with it because they have no choice. Besides, sometimes The Loop has its benefits. ,In the episodes provided in advance, a girl’s mother disappears and leaves behind a strange artifact in “Loop,” a boy hears voices coming from a strange globe in “Echo Sphere,” and in “Parallel,” a man stumbles into another universe. What follows each is a tender drama that feels like a play, each devoted mostly to loneliness. ,Each character, at least in the episodes screened, yearns for connection. While “Loop” is set in motion by a disappearance, it’s really about distance, as the girl’s search for her missing parent serves as a window into how they became strangers to each other. “Parallel” shows a man meeting himself in another universe, but it chooses character drama over genre thrills as the two versions of the same man attempt to befriend one another. Over and over, , gestures at some inarticulate sadness and shows its characters trying to work through it. ,It’s not that big of a stretch from Stålenhag’s art, which is overwhelmingly melancholic in the way it juxtaposes the mundane and the fantastic. Transposed from its original Swedish context to an American one, that sorrow takes on new wrinkles. The Loop puts boundless potential literally within arm’s length of small-town Ohio, and yet, its denizens lead more or less the same lives they’d live without it. People still work in what seem like dead-end jobs, they have trouble tilling their fields, they don’t see their families enough. Through the eyes of a set of acclaimed directors — Ti West, Charlie McDowell, So Yong Kim, and Mark Romanek each helm an episode — every moment feels delicate and human, and despair never overwhelms wonder. ,is an understated work in a time when more muted stories are easily swallowed up in the wealth of available options. It’s worth making the time for, though. These are slow stories about how technology was never going to fix us no matter how promising it seems. We still have to go the slow route and try to fill the void in ourselves by reaching out to others. "

The Office celebrates a work life that doesn’t exist anymore,"
          Apr  7, 2020, 12:23pm EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"The scenes that make ,special aren’t overly zany but are extremely relatable, like Dwight Schrute making an obnoxious sales call at his desk, while Jim and Pam roll their eyes at their colleague’s behavior. It happens almost every episode: two people, the stand-ins for the audience, acknowledging just how annoying the workplace is. ,is a show about the random, boring bits of everyday work life and the comedy that ensues from being surrounded by the same people on a daily basis. Employees sit at their desks, jokes are made, and snacks are munched on. Fifteen years later, it’s still one of the most enduring sitcoms because ,is an extraordinarily ordinary depiction of modern working life in America — well, it was. ,How jobs look has shifted radically over the last decade. The coronavirus pandemic simply sped up the circumstances for many industries. The gig economy is one of the biggest notable transitions. Uber, Lyft, Fiverr, Amazon Flex, and Airbnb didn’t exist 15 years ago when , premiered. Now, there are more than 55 million gig economy workers in the United States, , That’s more than 55 million people who don’t go into an office every day and share a kitchen with co-workers. Their idea of day-to-day work is already different from what ,presented. ,Before the pandemic forced us inside, ,was relatable. How does a workplace comedy operate without a workplace? Today, it feels like a piece of popular culture from eras past. Social distancing measures mean more people are working from home. Gags have shifted from pranking your deskmate to creating weird glitch art on Zoom using random anime backgrounds; hijinks in the shared kitchen turned into creating new Slack emoji to deliver a joke faster. ,Even those who aren’t in gig economy jobs are facing a time when physical offices aren’t necessary for most companies. Instant communication tools like Slack make talking with co-workers possible from anywhere, remote work is easy to do with an assortment of productivity services. Michael Scott’s outbursts in ,don’t transition well to Slack, where the equivalent is a message typed out in all-caps. That’s not as funny. ,Videoconferencing has also never been easier. Services like Zoom allow remote workers to talk face-to-face, all from the safety and comfort of their own homes. In December 2019, Zoom saw heights of 10 million daily users — by March 2020, Zoom was hitting “more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid,” ,“We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. ,Companies have transitioned quickly from operating in physical spaces to moving everything online. Zoom is hitting record-breaking numbers, as is Microsoft Teams, a group chat and collaboration tool from Microsoft that rivals Slack. Slack is no different. CEO Stewart Butterfield shared numbers in a lengthy tweet thread, noting that on Tuesday, March 10th, Slack’s concurrent users passed 10 million. That number jumped to 10.5 million just six days later, reaching 12.5 million on March 25th. ,“We have an incredible business that has been growing very quickly and that will continue to do so for many, many years to come,” Butterfield told Slack employees, as seen in ,. “We provide a platform that is going to become even more useful to the world in the years to come.” ,This pandemic will forever change parts of our lives, much like the 1918 influenza did more than 100 years ago. A big part of that will be the physicality of work. “The age of the office as we know it is probably over, and the bell can’t be unrung,” Matt Burr, CEO at Nomadic Learning, ,. More employees, once ready to commute into an office every day, will use tools like Slack and Zoom to work from home more often, according to Burr. Companies will see less of a reason to have physical space and will use remote advantages to build teams in different cities. ,Work has changed, and television will follow. Pop culture has always reflected our lives at a certain moment in time. Similar to how we revisit ,or ,to scratch the nostalgic itch for times when families were corny and homely or marathoning shows like ,and ,to reminisce about a time when people actually hung out, ,yearns for simpler times. Actress Angela Kinsey (who played Angela Martin on the show) described the series as inexplicably comforting. That comfort comes from the normalcy of a work routine — something I’ve come to miss in the weeks I’ve been at home. ,Less than 20 years ago, people worked in offices. Now, many of us work from home. Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein, co-producers on ,, are developing a new workplace comedy, but this one won’t include characters like Dwight and Jim throwing pencils at each other over their computers. Instead, the show is about a “wunderkind boss who, in an effort to ensure his staff’s connectedness and productivity, asks them all to virtually interact and work face-to-face all day,” , ,We’ve walked toward this change in work culture for years, but now it’s here for millions of people. The pandemic didn’t suddenly flip a switch; it proved that people can — and will — work without an office. Last year, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 26 million Americans, or approximately 16 percent of the total workforce, work from home. Imagine if half of ,’s cast suddenly stopped showing up because they could conduct calls at home and check in with co-workers online. Between 2005 and 2015, employees who telecommuted rose by 115 percent, the bureau reported.,Those years also happen to represent ,s run. As ,went off the air, so did the idea that day-to-day work would look the same as it did in 2005. More than 55 million people are gig workers who don’t have offices to go to, more people are set to work from home than ever, and an entire generation of employees may not experience that type of work setting — one considered universal less than 20 years ago. That’s the future pop culture will incorporate. There’s something poetic about ,’s co-producers being some of the first to try. ,“Start with the office comedy, lose the office and you’re just left with comedy,” co-producer Lieberstein told ,. “The math works.” ,In the meantime, many of us are at home, so lonely that we are wistfully streaming old episodes of ,, longing for the Dwight Schrutes in our lives, wishing they could do something annoying enough that we could turn to another colleague for just a moment and roll our eyes."

Narcos: Mexico is a show for people who want the drug war to last forever,"
          Feb 14, 2020,  3:34pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"started as a show about Pablo Escobar, a real-life gangster who outdid even the most outrageous fictional ones. The show built a compelling two-season crime thriller around his astonishing life and death. But while Escobar died, , — a hit that premiered in 2015, when Netflix was rapidly building its streaming empire — needed to go on. A third season followed another Colombian cartel. Then a spinoff, ,, tracked a parallel cartel in Central America. The first season detailed its rise; the second chronicles its fall. If there was any point to all this, it’s become hard to keep track of. The show is too busy following the cocaine., is the story of Mexico’s first drug kingpin, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (Diego Luna). The 10 episodes that premiere this week detail the dramatic implosion of Gallardo’s empire, a collapse that makes for extremely bingeable television. Yet, despite the thrilling spectacle, exhaustion seeps in. Even though it aims at being something more, , doesn’t seem to have ambitions far beyond those of the criminals it follows, pushing more product. ,The second season of , wants to make a point about consequences, at least on a surface level. The collapse of Gallardo’s empire stems directly from brash actions taken during his ascent — most directly, the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña), which sends agent Walt Breslin on a reckless mission of retribution. There are also bridges burned along the way, friendships set ablaze to use as fuel for ambition that leave many eager to see Gallardo out of power. ,Throughout, , occasionally makes overtures at the grander significance of the story it’s telling. Across 10 episodes, Gallardo’s desperate maneuvers to retain control of his business and stick it to those who have slighted him have consequences that reverberate beyond the criminal underworld, ultimately resulting in a rigged presidential election. “Sound familiar?” the show’s narrator winks. ,There is a long series of assumptions in this, ideas that have been present in , from the start, even as it occasionally paid lip service to their subversion: that Central and South American nations are lawless playgrounds for the corrupt, where prosperity can only be seized by crooks and violence reigns. Every now and then , does its diligence to complicate this picture, almost entirely via narration: a tossed off line that notes the Mexican and Colombian drug trades exist wholly to serve the appetites of the wealthy in the US and Europe, or another about the fundamentally destabilizing influence of the United States’ foreign policy that created problems in exchange for the glow up of “solving” them. ,The actual moral universe of the show is far simpler: dope dealers deserve whatever’s coming to them, the bad guys often win, and the good guys should be able to do whatever it takes to stop them. , can’t truly complicate itself any further because doing so would acknowledge that all these stories are the same story, and in telling them, the show becomes complicit. Midway through the first season of ,, Gallardo (Diego Luna) leaves his native country for a secret meeting in South America. In a moment that’s designed to be a big surprise for longtime , fans, Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) is waiting for him. ,“I’ve always sort of seen this as of the Marvel superhero universe of connecting narcotraffickers, and that they all coexist,” showrunner Eric Newman , not long after the season premiered in 2018. It’s a crass way of describing the dynamics at play in these stories of cartels and corruption, but also a very American one. The gringos, as the Mexicans doing the dirty work for the cartel bosses say, always want more. And what better expression of “more” is there than the excesses of the modern cinematic universe? ,This is how , has carried on, and how it will carry on if it continues its run. Just as , harkened back to , with a well-deployed Escobar cameo depicting a meeting that likely never happened in the real world, the show continues to hint at the ways it will sprawl outward and continue telling these kinds of stories now that it has exhausted the drama of Gallardo’s Federation. It’s not subtle about it either, making sure in its first season that you know Gallardo’s driver Joaquín Guzmán goes by “Chapo” and spending a considerable amount of time this season laying the groundwork for rivalries that he will carry into the future, for what will be one of the most prolonged conflicts in the history of Mexico’s drug war. ,You could tell this story indefinitely, because it is still being told today, with every story of a white person enraged at the sound of Spanish being spoken, with every ICE raid, with every chant for the wall. Cartel dramas like , are fairy tales for a nation in decline, flattening diverse and complicated countries for the benefit of a nation that refuses to acknowledge the havoc it has wreaked on the world.

The other three had some lovely animation — , was my least favorite of the package, and even that one I admired for the way it brought a natural, shaky camera movement to stop-motion animation, which is something I’ve never seen before.,The company that packs all the shorts together always pads out the running time with a few other short films from the year that didn’t snag a nomination. Usually, they’re appreciably worse. But this year, one of the bonus films was among my favorites and deserved to be a contender. It’s called ,, and it’s just six minutes of wonderfully goofy and perfectly done slapstick comedy. I understand why it wasn’t nominated.

The movie is currently scheduled to come out in June 2021.,This trailer is ostensibly for a movie starring Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it’s absolutely bizarre to watch. The reason why: the distributor is trying its best to hide the fact that this is not really a movie starring Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but a 2019 sequel to a Russian/Chinese film that happens to have the two action stars in small roles.

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"The two biggest satellite TV providers — Dish Network and DirecTV — may be looking to merge, according to Dish chairman Charlie Ergen, who called a potential merger with its biggest satellite rival “inevitable” on the company’s Q4 earnings call, according to ,. ,The news comes as Dish reports that in Q4 2019 it lost 100,000 satellite TV subscribers, along with roughly 94,000 Sling TV subscribers — the first time Sling TV’s subscribers have ever gone down. The drop in satellite customers isn’t nearly as bad as Dish reported a year ago, when it lost 386,000 subscribers, but it’s certainly not a good trend to see. All told, Dish lost a net total of 511,000 subscribers in 2019, compared to a loss of about 1.13 million in 2018. ,It’s that ongoing downward trend that led Ergen to comment that Dish and DirecTV “should get together,” noting that “the growth in TV is not coming from linear TV providers, but from huge programmers.” It’s not entirely clear what a merger would look like, given that DirecTV is currently owned by AT&T, but a sale of the satellite portion of AT&T’s TV business to Dish seems like a distinct possibility, especially given AT&T’s focus on new ,. ,Ergen went on to note that there would likely be regulatory issues to work out — after all, Dish and DirecTV already make up a considerable portion of the satellite market, and had already been barred from merging back in 2002 over concerns of eliminating competition. But the increased pressure from nontraditional internet TV services and streaming is taking a toll. “You just can’t swim upstream against a real tide of big players,” Ergen said. "
How The Mandalorian teamed up with Fortnite creator Epic Games to create its digital sets,"
          Feb 20, 2020,  2:19pm EST
        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"One of the most impressive parts of , (other than ,) was the production design, with the varied locations, sets, and effects despite the comparatively lower budget for television as opposed to a blockbuster film. ,As it turns out, that’s because most of it wasn’t real. Rather, more than half of the season was shot using Industrial Light & Magic’s new StageCraft technology, which uses giant 20-foot-tall LED video screens to create fully digital environments as in-camera sets and backdrops, ,. ,Those environments are purely digital creations, which ILM ,, and then projected around the actors and physical set elements (like spaceship parts or speeder bikes) to create the finished project. As part of that effect, those LED screens are actually then shot on camera for a seamless effect that replicates location shooting without the costs. (The 3D environments are specifically lit and rendered from the perspective of the camera to accomplish that.),There are also real benefits to the virtual sets compared to a traditional green screen setup. Since the actors are actually on the set with the displays, they can see and react to things in the background while they’re actually shooting, instead of imagining effects that will be added later.,It also means that the lightning from those digital sets is present on set and interacting with the physical elements, like the actors and props. So shots where Mando and Baby Yoda sit around a fire, with the sunset shining off Mando’s armor still look right because that light is actually there on set. It’s just coming from an LED screen instead of an actual sun. ,Additionally, because the “sets” are just digitally projected 3D environments, they can be moved around and edited on the fly. Don’t like where a mountain is in the background for a particular shot? Simply move it around, or just delete it entirely. ,ILM had already been using effects like this on existing films, ,, where the “windows” of the Millennium Falcon were digital screens, allowing for the lighting effect of the hyperspace jumps to be projected on the actors’ faces in camera. But , took the technology to a much bigger scale, with a 270-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling that created a 75-foot-wide set.,Again, check out ILM’s video to get the full look at StageCraft. But best of all, ,’s first season is just the start for this new tech. The company announced today that it’ll be making StageCraft available for use by filmmakers and showrunners worldwide as an end-to-end solution, meaning that the digital set technology could be showing up in a lot more TV shows and movies in the future."
"Hunters review: good at killing Nazis, and very bad at most other things","
          Feb 19, 2020,  8:43am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera," has a premise that feels like a double entendre. Amazon’s Jordan Peele-produced drama about Nazi hunters in the 1970s feels made with this specific moment when white nationalist sentiment gets parroted by government officials and in the national news. Characters are constantly saying things in a way that winkingly acknowledges the camera: ,The delivery always sounds like a dick joke, but the dick is Nazis. ,The slow-burn premiere introduces Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman), a Jewish teenager who lives in Brooklyn with his grandmother. When said grandmother is murdered in their home, Jonah discovers something she hid from the world: she was a member of a secret fraternity of Nazi-hunting vigilantes, exacting revenge on those conspiring to bring about a Fourth Reich. ,Headed by the wealthy Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino), the Hunters (if they sound like a superhero team, that’s intentional) methodically vet and seek out their victims and dole out painful justice on them, making sure they know exactly what crimes they are asking for. Interspersed throughout are interludes and flashbacks to concentration camps and the atrocities committed therein, lest the viewer start to feel that the Hunters are being a little , cruel. ,There are also strange diversions into dance, Guy Ritchie-style title cards but with a Yiddish exploitation twist, and fourth wall-breaking sketches. The villains monologue and salute a long-deceased Hitler with tears in their eyes. , is in the business of hurricane-force whiplash.,The only real anchors in all of this are the show’s two leads, Jonah and Offerman, and unfortunately, only one of them works. Despite being the de facto protagonist, Jonah doesn’t offer much to latch on to as a character. We get brief glimpses of his personal life — his friends, his crush, the anti-Semitic bully who tries to cheat Jonah out of the drugs he has to sell in order to help his grandmother pay the rent — but it’s all in the service of the plot. If we meet a person in his life, it’s because they’re going to ferry him to wherever he needs to be for the next scene to happen. ,This makes all of his big moments feel like they occur in a vacuum — especially when he’s paired up with the other Hunters, all of whom have a disappointingly small amount of screentime. Pacino is great. Everyone else makes you wonder what their deal is. (Also, Josh Radnor is on this show... why?),The five episodes that were made available in advance to critics leave things at a critical juncture halfway through the 10-episode season. Some of ,’ biggest thematic questions revolve around whether ends justify means or if the pursuit of vengeance risks corrupting those who seek it. These are familiar questions, perhaps even tired ones, but it’s possible that , comes up with an interesting answer. ,This is the upshot of a show as tonally uneven as ,: there’s no telling how it’s going to end. It’s hard to be optimistic. While the show does a lot of different things, one thing it doesn’t do is spend its time well. The first episode is nearly an hour and a half long; each of the four that follow clock in at about an hour. An inordinate amount of that time is spent mulling over a missed opportunity, longing for moments with the barely expressed rage of Pacino’s Offerman, or following any of the other Hunters instead of Jonah. It’s telling that, for all its stylistic quirks, the show is at its best when it’s playing it straight: the fourth episode, which tells twin stories of a bank heist and a couple’s desperate escape from a concentration camp, is among the best of the bunch and is delivered in a simple fashion. ,Like the eponymous team it follows, ,has a list of goals, and some of those goals are in conflict with one another. It wants to be a harrowing remembrance of the suffering of the Holocaust, a satisfying revenge fantasy, a sensational period piece, and a dark comedy. These can all be achieved together with skill, but only if the tension between them is acknowledged and addressed. Instead, the show shifts from tone to tone, more temperamental than genre-bending thrill ride.,It’s frustrating because even the ridiculous, preening Nazis of , share a trait that real-life fascists have: they know what they want. A show about the people who fight them should, too."

        ",Jay Peters,"A new deepfake puts Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pilot episode of the original ,, “The Cage” — and I kind of love it. In this particular AI-powered face swap, Bezos plays a Talosian alien with a huge bald head, while Musk plays Captain Christopher Pike (who is the captain of the USS Enterprise before James T. Kirk). 	,Here’s a very short version of what’s going on in this scene, if you’re wondering: in this episode, the Talosian aliens capture Pike to enslave him and use him to breed humans that will be used to rebuild a destroyed society. Pike tries to escape throughout the episode, and eventually, the Talosians decide that humans’ resistance to captivity won’t make them a good fit for that plan.,The conversation is kind of hard to follow, and that’s probably because the clips from the episode are stitched together to make it seem like it’s only the Talosian alien and Captain Pike having a conversation. In the actual episode, there are a number of other characters who are critical to the conversation that this deepfake doesn’t show. ,But even though the scene is confusing, I think the deepfake is scarily impressive, particularly the unsettling-looking Bezos as a Talosian alien.

Netflix’s Gentefied follows a Mexican American family in the heart of a gentrifying LA neighborhood,"
          Feb 21, 2020,  2:07pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"In ,, everyone knows the score. That’s the dark joke about being a young person of color in the US, where access to information is more equitable than the power to use that information. It’s easy to know exactly how you’re being shut out of opportunity and hard to do anything about it. For the Mexican family at the heart of ,, the game is clearly rigged, and winning it might cost more than it’s worth.,Netflix’s new half-hour dramedy from producer America Ferrera and writer / creator duo Linda Yvette Chavez and Marvin Lemus follows a trio of cousins who struggle to keep their grandpa’s taco shop afloat in Los Angeles’ Boyle Heights neighborhood. This is harder than it’s ever been: gentrification is sweeping through the neighborhood, slowly forcing the Chicano population out of town at a time when money isn’t easy to come by. ,Each cousin has their own dream in addition to the family one: Ana wants to be an artist and struggles to scrounge together expensive supplies and find a showcase for her work. Erik is torn between being responsible for running the shop and his desire to have a family of his own. Chris, just back from college, wants to be a chef in Paris, though it means stifling his Mexican heritage. ,In following the three of them and those in their orbit, , is both a celebration of a modern Mexican American family and also the story about their struggle against the ever-present threat of erasure. At every juncture, there’s something that wants them to forget who they are. In his studies to be a chef, Chris has developed an affinity for the upper-class, culturally sterile world of fine dining. Ana’s desire to find a platform for her art puts her at odds with her activist friends. Erik’s pride and machismo jeopardize the profitability of the shop and his relationship with Lydia, his estranged, pregnant ex who he wants to prove he’s good enough for. ,Lined up above them all are the invisible guillotines that dangle over many people of color in America. The ever-present call of the landlord; the racism of employers that must go unanswered, lest you lose your job; and the ambient threat of ICE officers who do not particularly care if you are a citizen. ,The show does seem to sometimes rely on a checklist, the kind that comes into play whenever there is a story about the slow infringement of wealthy white people on communities of color. A lot of the same tropes are present, whether it’s a show like , or ,or , before it. There are millennials who want all the same Instagram-friendly food and decor for taco Tuesday, landlords who would rather rent to said millennials at top dollar than the already-high rates they charge their current tenants of color, and the upper-middle-class institutions that only really want people of color if they clean up their act. (Read: be more white.),Because of this, ,is at its best when it gets specific: a midseason episode that follows a mariachi singer who frequents the taco shop, another that chronicles the lifelong friendship and romance between Ana and her girlfriend Yessika, or Chris’ ongoing struggles to prove to his fellow line cooks that he is “Mexican enough” and not a “coconut” (a term implying that he’s brown on the outside, white on the inside). ,Stories about the children of immigrants often revolve around the fundamental tension of being caught between the culture of their parents’ homeland and that of the home where they were raised. These kinds of stories are as old as immigration itself. In ,, there’s the modern wrinkle of “authenticity,” the monied interest in a culture sanitized for white consumption and social media clout without any concern for place, for people, for history. It is a constant pressure, easy to give in to and fun to participate in. ,It’s also impermanent. Soon, there will be something else. The tastemakers will move to another neighborhood, and no one will care for the accommodations once made for them. This is the existential threat facing the children of immigrants now. Fighting it seems impossible, an extra set of obstacles in addition to the regular set of hurdles you have to clear in order to achieve the better life your parents want for you. Give in, and all that will be left is the exorbitant rent in a gutted neighborhood your family left long ago, leaving fragments of a culture you are already starting to forget. "

While looking up where to stream it, Google presented me with its “top voted tags” for the movie (I have no idea how these are generated), which were: slow, boring, pretentious, overrated, confusing, strong acting, and “+3 more.” ,, I thought.,One fascinating technique the film repeatedly uses is to obfuscate the beginnings of things and drop us into events well past when they’ve begun. The entire beginning of the central romantic relationship is left offscreen, as is all but the ending of a very significant argument between the couple. It’s disorienting and strange, but it helps to convey the feelings of the protagonist — suddenly in over her head, not entirely sure of how things got this way.,There’s apparently a sequel in the works.

Better Call Saul knows how much we love a good scam,"
          Feb 25, 2020,  3:09pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera," was always going to be a show about a man dying in slow motion. At the start of the series, Saul Goodman — best known as Walter White’s huckster lawyer in , — goes by another name, the one given to him at birth. Jimmy McGill is a different, more earnest person than Saul Goodman, someone who does not exist in ,. Unlike Walter White, we know exactly what’s going to happen to Jimmy, and ,is a better show for it. ,In the show’s fifth season, Jimmy’s transformation into Saul is nearly complete. McGill is getting his feet under him after the death of his brother and the end of a yearlong suspension from practicing law. Now, he’s back in the saddle and trying to build his practice as fast as possible under his Saul Goodman alias, which he used for much of the last season to build connections with petty criminals he sold burner phones to for fast cash. ,It’s all so very sad, even if Bob Odenkirk’s carnival barker performance as Jimmy / Saul is as entertaining and funny as it’s always been. As a man who lost his brother, Jimmy never gives himself the opportunity to mourn, instead throwing himself back into the world of two-bit hustles that he knows best, working over suckers and building his reputation in the untapped market of low-level criminals in the habit of committing misdemeanors. Bit by bit, Jimmy McGill is being buried alive, and Saul Goodman is holding the shovel. ,Like the show from which it spun off, ,’s dramatic arc is an inevitable one. We know that things aren’t going to end well from the start — to a degree that , might sound repetitive to people who have seen ,. On a superficial level, this is true: both are shows about a man going sour. But the hows and whys of ,’s downward slide feel more vital and relevant, perhaps because they are more tragic. ,If ,showed us what entitled toxic masculinity looked like when it ran rampant in the life of the most milquetoast protagonist imaginable, , is about a slower, sadder thing: a man who learns that having feelings is for suckers. It’s a show for the irony-poisoned and extremely online where nothing is assumed to be genuine, and everything is probably a scam. , is concerned with what happens when people decide that scamming is the only way to win, and the immense harm inflicted by people who have convinced themselves that anyone behaving earnestly is just playing the game wrong. In ,, this is illustrated by Kim Wexler, Jimmy’s longtime friend and girlfriend / partner, a damn good lawyer in her own right with a bit of a grifter’s streak in her. ,Kim, however, is a character of integrity with a sense of justice and lines that she only crosses when that notion of justice is violated. She’s a vigilante scammer where McGill is an equal-opportunity swindler. At the end of the day, she believes in the system and in Jimmy’s capacity to be an honest man. This means, in ,’s universe, she’s doomed. ,In this penultimate season — the show will only return for one more — Kim is learning a truth that Jimmy’s in denial of: no matter how much you tell someone that they are capable of being honest or good, once they have decided that truth does not pay, it’s only a matter of time before they stop maintaining the charade altogether. And once someone has lost every reason to believe in earnest feeling or honesty or justice, they slowly start believing everyone else has, too. ,This is what , has been building toward: a fifth season premiere where Jimmy, as Saul Goodman, erects a carnival tent in an empty lot, surrounded by people who he believes are lost causes who will eventually need a lost cause like himself. The descent is more or less complete. As Jimmy builds the Goodman name, the cartel power players from , begin asserting themselves, and the gilded cage Saul Goodman will ultimately try to flee at the end of that series is nearing completion. He’s going to have it good for a while, though. Grifters always do. That’s part of the problem: we love a good scam. Feelings are for suckers. "

That would seem to make sense with the series’s narrative: her life is pretty normal — up until the part where you find out she has superpowers that allow her to blow things up with her mind. ,Netflix’s new comedy is a work of low-key dread that recalls a lot of other stories about young women coming of age. It has ,’s supernatural angst, ,’s oddball quirk, and the smart-twee edge of ,. Syd is a gross weirdo — she’s equally fascinated and frustrated by her leg acne, pretty fine with being ostracized by her classmates, and perplexed by the people she is attracted to. The difference here is that Syd is also very, very angry.,Sydney’s powers are a manifestation of her rage, and she has plenty to be mad about. Her best friend has fallen for a crude jock, her single mom is overworked and demanding, and, as the show slowly reveals, there’s a deep family trauma that has haunted her since before the series began. ,But even with this in mind, , spends most of its time being more charming than angry. Much of it focuses on Syd’s budding relationship with fellow weirdo Stanley Barber. Stanley is played by Wyatt Oleff — best known as one of the kids in , — who reads here as Timothee Chalamet, but a little bit wrong. This plays incredibly well opposite Sophia Lillis’ Syd, another , star and a tremendously talented young actor. ,Lillis juggles all of Sydney’s wildly conflicting emotions with ease, able to simultaneously portray the anxieties expressed in the running narration from Syd’s diary that’s read throughout the show and the quirky facade she presents to the world. With only seven short episodes, there’s not a whole lot of plot to burn through, but Lillis’ performance never lets you forget the multitude of emotions burning beneath Syd’s disaffected exterior. , doesn’t really end as much as it stops in its tracks. The season finishes with an abrupt conclusion that is clearly meant to set up a second season, but it also brings little in the way of resolution — something that feels a bit unfair given how lean and sharp the show is, each episode taking only just the time it needs to make its point and leave. (Usually, this doesn’t take much more than 20 minutes.),It doesn’t help that its cliffhanger ending tugs at the one plot thread that would make the show stand out beyond its new-school take on ,. Since its first image immediately conjures ,’s climax, the comparison is unavoidable and will immediately cause you to guess where,is going. (You probably won’t be that far off from the truth.) There’s more to this story, and readers of the Charles Forsman graphic novel it’s based on might be frustrated at some of its most fascinating and darkest plot beats are being reserved for another set of episodes. ,Despite this, ,works really well because of all the things it conveys without speaking a word, all of them difficult: being a young woman who doesn’t adhere to a narrow definition of femininity, who is figuring out her sexuality, who is handling grief, disillusionment, poverty, , superpowers. Why, the show quietly asks, is there no one there to catch Sydney if she falls apart?"

This is how Netflix operates and how the upcoming HBO Max app will operate as well.

Peacock will also come with a kids section, like every other streaming app, that is entering the streaming space this year. ,Then there’s the trending section. Peacock will also offer short-form content on a daily basis, including sports highlights, pop culture updates, and shorter news segments. Late-night clips, for example, ,. This includes ,clips that people may have missed — Strauss referred to it as the ability to get rid of the “FOMO” (fear of missing out) you might experience by missing a late-night episode right when it airs. This can help NBCUniversal pull subscribers away from YouTube, where many of these highlights already live after the live airing, and over to Peacock — if everything goes according to plan. ,The third section is channels. NBC is a linear network that wants to remind people how important television is, so Peacock is designed to try to replicate the look of traditional television, Strauss says. Subscribers can pull up a channel guide to scroll through, much like we already do with cable packages now, and see what’s on. They can select from TV shows, news, sports, and movies, as well as look into specific types of content hubs. A ,hub, for example, will also get a “channel” look for people to browse through if they like. ,These are Peacock’s three sections, but there are more product features like curation around specific shows. For instance, fans of NBC’s ,will be able to , and then select from a character like Michael or Jim and watch episodes that are centric to those characters, or are seen as some of the best. There are “beginner” options that give new viewers a chance to figure out the best episodes to watch, too.

Netflix will nearly double the number of French language originals,"

        ",Nick Statt,"Netflix today signaled a significant new investment in France with the , and a content roadmap that will see the streaming service nearly double the number of French language originals it has produced so far. Since 2014, Netflix has produced 24 productions in French, including six films and nine television series. But the new plan is to add 20 new productions, and to grow its new corporate presence in Paris consisting of 40 employees to one nearly three times the size. ,Netflix is doing similar expansions across the globe, including elsewhere in Europe and in South America. The company has plans to ,, and last year it ,. It also has offices in England, the Netherlands, and Spain. ,The goal is to diversify its lineup of shows and movies to attract more international customers, especially as growth in its US subscriber base has hit its upper limit and competition from domestic giants like Disney and HBO heats up. Last July, the number of Netflix customers in the US ,. That’s made Netflix’s focus on international expansion more crucial than ever before. ,Netflix has had successful run with foreign language shows, including Spanish language crime thriller hits like ,and , and German language sci-fi show ,. It’s also struck gold with some of its foreign language films, including Oscar nominated ,from Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón. And Netflix is investing heavily in Japanese language content, including securing the ,, as another segment of the streaming wars now includes an , both new and old. ,Yet while expanding its presence in a country like France is arguably good for business, there’s also a legal reason at play. The European Parliament , new regulation regarding Netflix and other streaming services’ presence in the EU that mandates that at least 30 percent of all content carried on the platform be originally produced in the region. Amazon, Netflix, and other companies have until September 2020 to hit that quota. So it’s likely Netflix’s new investments in Germany, Italy, and France will help it do so. ,There’s also Netflix’s somewhat contentious relationship with the French cinema community, after the company’s high-profile showdown with the Cannes Film Festival over contest eligibility requirements. Netflix was , due to its limited theatrical runs, which ran afoul of France’s new rules around local releases and, more broadly, the country’s cultural commitment to cinema as an institution. ,Netflix then pulled out of the festival officially, and it ,. So a new, dedicated presence in Paris and a substantial increase in its investment in local productions may help smooth over that once-soured relationship. "

The Hooded Justice episode, in particular, was worth watching the entire season for. That hour is perhaps a better encapsulation of the show than the entirety of the show, and it feels so true to the book that it hardly seems like it wasn’t in there in the first place.,I did find the series’ structure a little frustrating, though. Very little actually happens during the timeline of the show — there’s a murder, some flashbacks, and then the ending arrives. Nearly everything important occurred before the show started, and we just have to wait for characters to reveal to us what they’ve already done.

Netflix reveals that 76 million people watched at least two minutes of The Witcher,"

The company says the series was watched by 76 million households, making it the most-watched first season of television ever for Netflix. That’s according to Netflix’s newly unveiled definition of “watched,” which it changed from “watched 70 percent of a single episode of a series” to anyone who “chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes.” ,In explaining the new metric, Netflix notes that the two-minute time period is meant to be “long enough to indicate the choice was intentional,” and it says that it follows similar metrics used by BBC’s iPlayer, YouTube, and ,’ measurements of page views. But the reasoning behind the change is obvious: to juice viewer numbers, with Netflix acknowledging that the new two-minute metric is “about 35% higher on average than the prior metric.” ,To put that number in perspective, two minutes of , is less time than it takes to reach the opening credits of the first episode; the action-packed cold opening is coincidentally two minutes and 16 seconds long. By Netflix’s new metric, anyone who watched just the opening scene of the episode (or 3.2 percent of the total runtime of the episode, which is itself one of eight episodes) is now counted as a view for the entire season. That is also shorter than the amount of time it would take to listen to the hit song “,,” which is also featured in the series.,Still, no matter how you slice it, 76 million households in the first four weeks is a lot of eyes on ,, which Netflix says is “tracking to be our biggest season one TV series ever.” And apparently that’s enough for Netflix to invest in the show for the long haul, as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said , is a “massive new franchise that we’ll develop season after season” in a ,.

Little America has small ideas about the immigrant experience,"

        ",Joshua Rivera,"According to its ,, , is “an anthology of funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring, and surprising stories about the lives of immigrants in the United States.” Its first season, released this month on the streaming service, is a collection of eight half-hour stories about immigrants who are trying to make it in the US. It’s the best show Apple has produced so far, but it’s also the most misguided. ,It almost hurts, considering the talent behind ,. Created by Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Lee Eisenberg, just about every episode is an excellent half-hour of television. Each actor on-screen is wonderful to watch, warm and likable at all times. The array of brown faces in front of and behind the camera is dazzling: Uchenna “Conphidance” Echeazu, Eshan Inamdar, Kemiyondo Coutinho, and Tze Chun are actors and filmmakers from a wide variety of backgrounds. The stories they tell (all based on real life) stop just shy of being saccharine.,The trouble is the framing. Like many immigrant stories, they are about overcoming or confronting nigh-insurmountable hardships. In “The Manager,” protagonist Kabir is 12 years old when his parents are deported, and he must take over the family motel, raising himself and running a business while writing obsessively to the government about his parents being readmitted into the country. He will not see them in person again until he is an adult.  In “The Son,” a gay Syrian man flees his family who reacted violently to discovering his orientation, crossing the border into Jordan in the hopes that he can one day claim asylum in the United States. “The Rock” is about an Iranian father who wants to purchase a home in the US but cannot afford it. Instead, he buys a plot of land with a massive, unremovable rock on it and commits to removing it, one chunk at a time. The house is never built.,Because , positions these stories as “inspiring,” it’s worth thinking about why. ,The idea is that we do not see these people represented very often — people who, in the real world, suffer all manner of prejudice and setbacks because they have dared to live a life in a country that is not made for them, even as it postures as the land of opportunity. ,, and works like it, exist as an act of empathy: look at these people. They just want the same simple things you do. A home, a business, a job, love. There are so many shades to the same story. ,But the exceptional nature of ,’s subjects plays into the idea that immigrants must earn our empathy, earn the right to be in the US, earn the mere chance to find happiness. In the US, stories like these are treated like a guidebook for citizenship if you’re a person of color and “inspiring” fodder for white people who want to believe themselves tolerant.,In another, more equitable pop culture landscape, maybe ,would land better. There is room for stories like these, and it bears repeating: it’s pretty good television! What hurts the series most is its frequent refusal to acknowledge that there are , its characters struggle with such hardship. In ,, coming to the United States to make a life is just ,, and the reasons are irrelevant — when, in fact, they are vital. ,The episodes that rise above this are the ones that show , each character faces the plight they do. “The Son” makes it immediately clear why a gay man must flee his Syrian family. In “The Grand Prize Expo Winners,” a Chinese woman wins a cruise for herself and her children. During their time at sea, her dreams of the American life she has obtained and the dreams her children have after being raised in the US come into quiet conflict. The bittersweet nature of the immigrant experience is made tangible for half an hour. ,These episodes are the exceptions. A good second season of , (which is already on the way) would follow their lead. A better one would ditch our cultural fixation on immigrant struggle porn entirely. ,There is dignity in being unremarkable. A noble life can be lived by those who are not paragons, by people getting by on wages too small in homes that do not fit their families in less-than-desirable neighborhoods. , wants its audience to regard immigrants as fully realized people.

It mostly leads to sadness and embarrassment as he begins to realize that everything he’s been told is wrong.,Some of the most revealing moments are big and obvious, like another child being surprised to see that everything he’d learned about Jews was a lie.

Disney is billing this as the show’s final season, so this isn’t exactly a way to keep Disney+ filled with new , content. But the rest of the show is available to stream, too, which should mean there’s plenty for people who haven’t seen the series yet. The new season debuts February 21st.,It doesn’t really matter whether , is a very good documentary or not — it has intimate access to Taylor Swift, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of her latest album, and promises to explore much of the drama that surrounds her: people are going to watch it one way or another.

It didn’t., was ABC’s smash hit about the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 and the island where they crashed. The show was great at character-driven stories and showing how the island (generally) turned them all into better people, but it did so in an exciting way by making those stories play out among the many mysteries, questions, and curiosities of the island.,Throughout six seasons of these dangling questions, I — like many other fans — was ready for answers. But by the time of the finale, it was becoming clear that we weren’t going to get the mind-melting revelations we were hoping for. , represented, among other things, candidates to replace an immortal being that ruled the island? Hmm. The smoke monster was made when that being threw his brother into a magical cave of light? Uh, okay.,And in the finale, we finally learned that the island kept its mystical energy because... a plug in a pool kept the island’s magical water from draining away. Following season after season of increasingly clever answers to increasingly clever mysteries, seeing the banal reality of a giant drain stopper was something of a letdown.,But I loved the finale anyway. Instead of checking off every box, executive producers Carlton Cuse (who has since created , and Amazon’s , series) and Damon Lindelof (, and HBO’s ,) instead packed the finale with as many unforgettable character-driven moments as they could. And that, in retrospect, is what the show was , the best at the whole time, anyway. Who can forget iconic moments like “,,” the reveal of the show’s ,, and ,?,Ironically enough, the finale made its character moments really shine by paying off , mystery in a huge way. Season 6 played with , trope of flashbacks or flash-forwards by instead presenting flash-,a weird alternate reality where Oceanic Flight 815 didn’t crash. In the flash-sideways, the characters apparently have no knowledge of their connections on the island. The audience doesn’t know what the point of the flash-sideways was — until they reach the series finale. By that time, the audience knows that the show’s characters can “wake up” from the flash-sideways and suddenly recollect their lives on the island.,These sepia-toned recollections are powerful flashes of each character’s most memorable plots throughout the entire show, usually with their one true love, and each is backed by the very best of Michael Giacchino’s amazing soundtrack. The finale gives us ,: , how they rekindled their relationship and eventually died together. , how they fell in love. , their amazing, wonderful, best-ever relationship. ,These moments of recollection in the finale were beautiful when I first watched the final episode live in May 2010. But when I recently rewatched the episode, sitting next to the person I would marry six days later, these scenes , me. I cried at every single one.,I’ve come to realize that the point of the finale, and perhaps all of ,, wasn’t to get answers to the plot questions that got many of us to care about the show in the first place. (That is something I also think is true about most of the recent enduring prestige TV dramas, including ,, ,, and, yes, even ,.) The point was to deliberately show that the real journey, and I mean this with no irony, was the friends the characters made along the way — and maybe that’s what the journeys of our real lives are, too."

I’ve never read the book, but from what I gather, the movie is an almost complete departure from the text outside of its core conceit.,Departing from the book isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Norton’s instinct to play up the noir elements makes for a fun, slapstick twist on the genre at points, and 1950s New York is a lot of fun to explore.,But the movie also feels a little hollowed out. Norton basically jams a tour through , (the famously thorough 1975 biography of Robert Moses, which has nothing to do with ,) into the core of his adaptation, without much to say about it. It’s great historical drama, but it’s mostly used here to give the characters something cool to see and do. That story deserves a whole lot more attention than what it’s given.,Check out eight trailers from this week below.,The first trailer for , came out this week, and it’s really all about highlighting how stylized and 1980s this thing is going to be. Seriously, I have almost no idea of what’s happening in the movie after watching this — this trailer is all about the vibe, and it looks like a lot of fun. The film comes out June 5th.,So listen, this looks like a perfectly nice movie. But I’m completely puzzled why this is what we’re getting after all the ridiculous hubbub over the last ,.

At the very least, the show looks like it’s bound to be visually impressive with the budget to do things on an appropriately huge scale. It comes out December 20th.,There are two types of , seasons: ones where Larry obnoxiously breaks social norms and we watch the fallout, and ones where Larry bumps up against norms in unexpected ways, highlighting just how weird they can be. I really think only one of these, the latter, makes for good seasons of the show — and there have been some excellent seasons. But I thought season 9 went too far in the “obnoxious Larry” direction, and it seems like season 10 is headed that way, too. I hope not, because , can be such a fun show to watch when it’s at its best. The new season starts January 19th.,I didn’t include an earlier trailer for , because the movie seems to be hitting a lot of very familiar horror beats. But you know, it seems to be doing a good job of it, too. The movie looks quiet and creepy, and who doesn’t love seeing a pained Jesse Plemons say something that he obviously knows more about than he’s letting on. The movie comes out April 17th.,I didn’t think this was a real movie when I first started seeing trailers floating around for it, because it just seems so much like a weird little joke Ryan Reynolds would make. But no... this is a movie. A real, complete movie about, basically, an NPC in a video game who becomes a real player, or something like that. The premise is strange and a little nonsensical. The entire thing is weird, really. I’m mostly sharing this out of morbid fascination. It’s coming to theaters? I don’t believe it. Supposedly it’s happening on July 3rd."
Runaways finally figures out the show it wants to be — right before it ends ,"
          Dec 13, 2019, 11:37am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera," could’ve been great. The show’s basic premise, about a group of teens who discover that their parents are all supervillains and run away to fight them, is beautifully on the nose. Teenagers rebelling against parents who are actually evil! Also, there are superpowers and a pet dinosaur? If no one else tries it, ,will. ,Unfortunately, ,, Hulu’s TV series based on the Marvel comic created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, stumbled with the execution almost immediately. Its first two seasons were oddly paced and imbalanced, sapping all momentum from the show by decisions that didn’t end up working out so well — first in choosing to slow down the story so that the eponymous Runaways don’t actually, well, run away until the first season finale, and then in choosing to focus on their parents just as much. (Parents are boring, everyone knows that.),In its third and final 10-episode season, out today, ,goes for broke and resets everything — but slowly. The first half of the season is dedicated to tying up the majority of plot threads introduced over the last two years. The second half barrels headfirst into something new: the show it always should have been. ,It’s a lot like watching the show clean up its own act before it goes off to a bright future in college, one episode at a time. The last season left the cast — teen polymath Alex Wilder, power-goth Nico Minoru, reformed jock Chase Stein, dinosaur owner / intersectional feminist Gertrude Yorkes, super-strong kid sister Molly Hayes, and secret alien Karolina Dean — split up and pretty much beat. Their parents, formerly members of an evil cult of alien worshippers, now possessed by the even-more-evil aliens they worshipped, have captured half the team and imprisoned them in a low-budget version of the Matrix. It’s all part of a scheme to open up a portal to another world and, well, you know what? The show doesn’t really care. ,I can’t stress enough how strange and funny it is to watch ,completely change its mind about its direction mid-season, as its cast gets whisked away to another dimension in order to give the show a hard reset. In a way, it’s remarkable. It’s incredibly rare to see a show address and internalize a critical dressing-down and make a hard pivot for the better, but that’s what ,does. ,The parents and their cult-related schemes are almost entirely dispensed with, only brought back when it makes sense. With their reduced presence, the teens actually get to indulge in some teen drama and weird comic-book-y shenanigans involving alternate dimensions, teen covens, and double-crossing. One of the most frustrating character changes, rewriting Nico Minoru’s character from the teen witch of the comics to someone who just owns an alien staff, is completely retconned. She’s a witch now. Magic is now a confirmed thing on the show. ,It’s so much of a thing, in fact, that the final villain of the season is Morgan le Fay, the sorceress of Arthurian legend (and also a Marvel comics character). Also making appearances are Ty Johnson and Tandy Bowen, the light- and darkness-powered heroes of Marvel’s other doomed-too-soon teen show on Freeform, ,. , final season is a bittersweet watch. For years, the comic it was based on was one of the best points of entry for comic books, more interested in believable characters and fun pacing than any of the normal trappings of superheroics. Its TV adaptation could have been just as refreshing, but too often, it looked like a pale, confused imitation. ,At the very least, it gets to go out with a bang."

        ",Chaim Gartenberg,"“,” ,So begins the tale of ,, , that ran in 2015 and (somehow) returned for an even longer second season the following year.,On the surface, it’s a generic send-off of the fantasy genre that plays like a watered down version of , (with a little less heart and a little more snark). But , has a trick up its sleeve — it’s also a musical, a song-and-dance affair like a live-action Disney movie of old. , like a Disney movie, in fact, given that the songs were all written by the legendary Alan Menken (,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,) and co-collaborator Glenn Slater. ,The show starts by setting up a classic fairy-tale story in its , — Galavant is a gallant knight, riding to save his beloved Madalena from the clutches wicked King Richard — and then promptly blows the entire premise to bits. ,What follows are a few hours of fantasy-fueled musical comedy. There are jousts. There are sword fights. There are a variety of guest cameos. And of course, there are lot of enjoyable tunes, which range from clever to impossible to get out of your head. ,The cast is great, too: Joshua Sasse plays the titular hero, given equal opportunities to flex his golden pipes and biceps; Karen David is the iron-willed Princess Isabella, and Mallory Jansen is Galavant’s trope-dodging lost love Madalena. But the standout is Timothy Omundson’s King Richard, the initial antagonist who steals the show as a blustering, bumbling dictator with a heart of gold (and a truly magnificent beard). It helps that nearly all of the main cast can actually sing well, which means that there’s less of the awkwardness and auto-tuning typical of a Very Special Musical Episode from most shows. ,It’s not deep, but it’s deeply fun, especially if you (like me) particularly enjoy Disney renaissance movies and stage musicals. Thanks to its very unpopular nature, , is also extremely short, the kind of thing you can easily binge on a weekend when it’s too cold to go outside. To say that almost no one watched the first season of the show is an understatement — it was one of ABC’s worst shows that year — and despite a cliffhanger ending, it seemed like , was doomed to be nothing more than an easily missed blip on ABC’s schedule. ,Except, for some reason, it wasn’t. ABC gave the show a “miracle” renewal for a second season, and , delivered one of the most satisfying sequels of the decade. Season 2 takes everything further: more songs, more episodes, more off-kilter fairy-tale wackiness. The first episode, titled “A New Season ... aka Suck It Cancellation Bear” (a reference to ,) starts with a song that sees the , and features a shameless appeal to viewers to watch , instead of football, the Golden Globes, or , ,. The second season also adds more fantasy elements and specific parodies of stage musicals (including , and ,), as icing on the cake. ,ABC also took a page out the book of the far more popular ,, releasing songs individually on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube in the hopes that social media buzz might help lead to more success for the series. It also means that all the music is available to listen to, which you will mostly likely want to do after watching ,.  ,That the show even got renewed at all is a wild story. , was announced as part of ABC’s lineup in 2014, before being consigned to the mid-season break as filler for , Sunday night slot. (ABC had so little faith in the series that the eight-episode season was actually condensed into four weeks, with two episodes airing each Sunday). As expected, ratings were dismal, with the adorable musical comedy series being utterly crushed by ABC’s generally poor viewership, playoff football games, and award shows like the Golden Globes. A cancellation was all but guaranteed — except that ,was a favorite of then-ABC president Paul Lee, who ordered a second season against all odds (and against all common sense, if we’re being totally honest).,’s renewal — along with another season for the also poorly performing Marvel spinoff , — was part of Lee’s strategy to create “sticky” content that bet more on building brands with long-term cultural staying power over immediate rating success. This bet would spectacularly fail — ,, both ,and ,swiftly returned to lose half of their already poor audiences, and Lee was soon ousted and replaced by Channing Dungey. ,Lee’s ideas (and ,) might have just been a little ahead of its time; today’s streaming era puts a far bigger emphasis on word-of-mouth success and cultural mindshare than it does hard numbers about who’s watching. It’s easy to imagine a world where , was released as a streaming exclusive on something like Disney+ or Netflix, where its niche appeal could better shine outside of the harsh landscape of traditional network television. ,In the golden age of television the last decade has given us, it’s hard to say that , is a , show.

        ",Andrew Webster,"You learn nearly everything you need to know about , hero Geralt (Henry Cavill) a few minutes into the first episode. The titular witcher — a work-for-hire monster hunter with some helpful superpowers — is first seen in a swamp, nearly killed by a giant spider monster, beaten and almost drowned. In the next scene, Geralt heads to a local pub for information on his next quest, only to be subjected to ridicule and scorn from villagers who are scared of his supernatural nature. Ultimately, he’s saved from a barroom brawl thanks to a helpful young woman, who very quickly becomes a romantic partner.,The Netflix adaptation captures the enigmatic hero perfectly. He’s struggling to survive in a world that hates him, stubbornly sticking to a moral code that forces him into dangerous  situations. He’s gruff and sarcastic, always down for a fight, impossibly charming, and frequently irresistible. It’s a premise that worked well in book and video game form — and now it’s one of the best series on Netflix., is based on a series of fantasy novels from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which reached a new level of global popularity thanks to a series of video games. ,, in particular, propelled the franchise to blockbuster status. Every iteration follows Geralt, part of an ancient and dwindling line of monster hunters known as witchers. They’re mutated from a young age to be stronger and faster, and the process also gives them limited magical abilities and prolonged life spans. Geralt is a gunslinger type, moseying into a town in trouble, slaying the inevitable magical beast, collecting his pay, and moving on.,In this way, , is different than most fantasy stories, including obvious contemporaries like ,. It does have the elements of a vast epic tale — including plenty of political machinations and lots of warring kingdoms — but at its best, , is like a fantastical detective series, with Geralt investigating dangerous magical creatures and inevitably being pulled into much bigger conspiracies.,What makes the new show work so well is the way it seamlessly blends together these two types of storytelling. There , an interesting overarching story. In addition to Geralt, the show also follows Ciri, a young princess with mysterious powers who is on the run from a rival kingdom, and Yennefer, a fiercely independent sorceress with grand ambitions. Viewers follow along as their three paths inevitably intertwine. But instead of the serialized approach favored by prestige television, for much of its runtime , has more of a “creature of the week” structure. (This changes in the final two episodes as the season rushes towards a conclusion that very clearly sets up the second season.),Each episode — many of which are based explicitly on short stories from the books — tasks Geralt with solving a different monster-related problem, whether that’s a princess turned into a beast, or a vengeful djinn who has cursed his best friend, the bard Dandelion (who primarily goes by Jaskier in the show). The structure feels true to the spirit of the series, while also making it work well for television.,It also means that the show demands a bit more from viewers. Events in , don’t always unfold in chronological order, and there’s no explicit indication of whether you’re watching a scene in the past or present. Instead, you have to sort out the timing based on contextual clues: a line about an event you’ve already seen, or how close two characters have become. (Figuring out the timing isn’t helped by the fact that witchers and sorcerers barely age.) It took me a few episodes to get a solid sense of things. This also means , benefits from repeat viewings, where you can pick up on small details you may have missed the first time.,The most important part of ,, though, is Geralt himself. I’ll admit: I was nervous after seeing the initial photos of Henry Cavill in a Party City-esque white wig, but he absolutely nails the role. His Geralt is the exact right blend of scary, sexy, and sarcastic. Even his gravelly voice is perfect. The wig may look strange at times, but ultimately it doesn’t distract from what makes Geralt interesting. You even get to see him in multiple ,.,As a TV show, , is particularly refreshing in an era full of nihilistic fantasy stories inspired by ,. Yes, the show gets brutal at times. The wonderfully choreographed fight scenes are extremely violent, as is one very particular and hard-to-watch magical transformation. It’s a show where — shock! — the bad guys are usually humans, not monsters. What makes , feel different, though, is in the details. These stories aren’t full of people being awful for the sake of it; they’re making choices based on love or survival, and then things go wrong. What makes , so compelling is how it delves into these gray areas, exploring why people do what they do. By the end, you’ll have some measure of sympathy for almost everyone, no matter how irredeemable they might seem at first.,Crucially, , has a sense of humor. It’s not all dark and dire. Jaskier (Joey Batey) frequently plays the comedy relief, following Geralt around despite not being welcome, in order to turn Geralt’s exploits into song, sometimes breaking the fourth wall in the process. “There I go again,” he says at one point, “just delivering exposition.” When he meets the witcher for the first time, the bard tells him “I love the way you just sit in a corner and brood.” Meanwhile, Geralt’s quietly sarcastic nature is on full display. He can cut through any situation, no matter how awkward or horrible, with a frustrated “fuck.” And one of the show’s most dramatic sex scenes is accompanied by a playful jig and gawking onlookers making jokes.,could’ve very easily turned out wrong. It’s not hard to misinterpret what it is that actually makes the series interesting, but the TV adaptation gets it. ,is funny, intense, and uncomfortable, and it balances out those disparate emotions almost perfectly. Yes, it stars Henry Cavill in a bad white wig, but you’ll forget about all of that as soon as he starts talking."

But it was the next scene that got me fully on board, one that showed that Rorschach, the original comic’s most popular character, was a hero to white supremacists. It felt transgressive but also right — and then I flipped back to the comic and you know what? It ,right. The TV , sold me on its relevance by resurfacing something incredibly obvious about its source material that years of fan culture had scrubbed away, mostly because the character looked cool. ,There’s an understandable urge to laud popular culture that ,, to credit shows or movies that address injustices or give a platform to the marginalized. It’s a good impulse, even if it leads to overly forgiving criticism. So it’s important to note that, while , is definitely one of this year’s best shows for the provocative way it centers race in a way that both mainstream entertainment and pundits often do not, it’s also incredible for being fun as hell. There’s time travel, killer action, a deep conspiracy, and a great love story. There’s a lot there — maybe too much to end well. And you know what? If it doesn’t, that’s fine.,In 2019, , (the comic) was arguably more trouble than it’s worth. As a work of comics, it’s as good as everyone says, a rich reading experience that’s held up for decades. As a cultural touchstone, however, it’s been a disaster, inspiring a whole generation of creators and fans who were more fascinated in its “realistic” take on superheroes than its pervasive ideas about a world marching toward its own annihilation, and the cultural attitudes that brought it to the brink of doomsday. ,One way to measure the success of HBO’s , has been how satisfying it is to watch the show completely rewrite its source material, trading its anxieties for current ones, taking its criticisms of superhero fiction and extending it further to make it a criticism of power and the whiteness of that power. In this new ,, superheroes aren’t just the purview of thrill-seekers and proto-fascists. They’re how white supremacy digs its roots deeper into the culture: not just by seizing power, but also by seizing our fantasies. We all wanted to be heroes, but white faces were the only ones behind all the masks and superpowers, by design. ,And so, across the eight episodes leading up to this finale, , took a sledgehammer to this foundation. It corrected its fictional history the way we have begun to correct our real one, re-centering the main thrust of its stories on the people of color previously ignored. Hooded Justice, the first superhero, is not the white man historians assumed he was, but a black hero born from the trauma of the Tulsa race riot and refused justice at every turn by the racist country he tried to serve, first in war, and then with a badge. Doctor Manhattan, the godlike superhuman, is reinvented under the guise of Cal Abar, a black man living in Oklahoma. The villain of the show is a folksy white senator, friendly and seemingly well-intentioned, secretly leading a cabal of racists who want to help him steal the powers of a god, simply because he feels entitled to take them. ,The ,comics are celebrated because they challenged popular notions about superheroes and comics, changing our perceptions of what they could be. Over thirty years later, HBO’s , is doing the same thing, by upending the foundation of , itself. If it never gets a second season, that’d be enough — even if the finale doesn’t quite stick the landing."

I’m writing this before I’ve seen the new movie, so instead I’m going to write about ,, which I think did some very smart things to set up this film, even if it may have also made life a little trickier for J.J. in other ways, too.,The smartest thing , did for the trilogy was kill off Snoke — an empty plot device — and set up Kylo Ren as the ultimate villain.

I think that’s part of the fun of these movies, but it also makes for difficult endings when so much of the framework has to be established within the final movie.,Check out 11 trailers from this week below.,(P.S. I’m off for the holidays next week, but I’ll see you all again in 2020!),Here’s the latest from Christopher Nolan. ,, which he wrote and directed, appears to be  a time-bending action thriller that has its heroes trying to stop a bad guy or something (IDK they mention World War III and nukes) while other characters are going backward in time in front of them. The visual effect is very trippy and a little weird to watch, but I imagine it’ll make for a cool premise. The film comes out July 17th. (I must note, I’m not sure I’ve seen a trailer before that ends with the message: “SEE THE TRAILER IN THEATERS FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT.” What effect? What? Vision? It’s just bigger!),I didn’t realize this when the first trailer for , came out: the entire film is presented as if it were a single unbroken shot. Long takes are an effect that can easily be misused, but I get the impression that it makes a lot of sense here — the film is about two soldiers racing across France to deliver an urgent message about an impending ambush, and the unbroken shot should play up the impact of that ticking clock. It comes out January 10th.,I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a trailer quite like this. The new trailer for , is basically just a triumphant dose of nostalgia — two minutes of ,Top Gun,? — without actually getting into the substance of the movie at all. But I guess substance doesn’t matter here. It’s Tom Cruise. It’s ,. We know what we’re gonna get. It comes out June 26th.,The latest from my boy Joe Wright (director of the 2005 ,) is a ,-style thriller that has a woman confined to her home trying to unravel a murder she believes she’s witnessed.

It comes out May 15th.,Here’s the latest trailer for ,, Pixar’s fantasy twist on a road movie. Despite the cute mashup, the premise and world somehow still feel familiar, and it’s kind of tempering my interest. The movie looks like an entirely pleasant and fun trip, but I’m just not sure it’ll be any more than that. The film comes out March 6th. ,Written and directed by Eliza Hittman, , is about a teenage girl who travels from rural Pennsylvania to New York City to get an abortion, where consent of a parent isn’t required.

"Netflix’s stalker thriller You returns for a second season, and it kills","
          Dec 23, 2019,  9:00am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"Perhaps the most deliciously satisfying thing about ,is that it began as a Lifetime show. It seemed to fit right in, too — based on the novel of the same name by Caroline Kepnes, the show followed bookseller Joe Goldberg as he began to stalk a woman named Beck, gradually inserting himself more and more into her life as he attempted to woo her and isolate her from all her friends. You know. Lifetime stuff. ,After a killer-but-little-watched first season, the show migrated to Netflix, where it will maybe find the audience it deserves — and yes, it does deserve it. Because ,masquerades as trashy thriller in order to get you to underestimate it — dismiss it, even — while it goes to work subverting every assumption you had about it. It’s a trick that doesn’t seem repeatable, but in ,’s second season, out December 26th, the show somehow pulls it off.,The second season of , is a bit of a reset. ,’s first season was fairly conclusive (I’ll be vague to preserve the fun for those who haven’t seen it), so in its second season, Joe — trying to start over after the first season’s events in New York — moves to LA, a place he hates, but also a place no one knows him. ,After briefly entertaining the notion of being a changed man who has left his stalking ways behind, Joe quickly falls into his old patterns. This time, his obsession is a woman named Love, his coworker at the hybrid wellness store / bookshop Anavrin. (Spell it backward and groan with me.),At first, it seems like , is simply repeating itself, playing the same beats with a different woman in Joe’s sights. To a certain extent, that’s true — there’s even a running subplot about a troubled woman who lives next door with a plucky kid Joe becomes protective of, a mirror image of season 1 — but as the twists pile up, the reflection comes across as intentional and effective. And it’s not like there aren’t new things happening here. Love’s codependent relationship with her brother takes , into some unexpected places, and the show’s new setting gives it new arenas for exploring toxic masculinity. There’s also some leftover threads from last season that turn the pressure up. And finally, harkening back to a similar moment in season 1, when the show finally breaks free of Joe’s perspective to let the audience in on Love’s side of the story, things , take a turn. ,What makes , subversive, brilliant television is delightfully simple: Joe is an idiot. Sure, he reads a lot of books and, as an observer of people, is pretty deft at manipulating the fundamental selfishness of others. But as a criminal? He’s hilariously incompetent. This is where , twists the knife you never knew it slipped in, because the point of the show is that he doesn’t , to be good at any of this. , makes it easy to condemn Joe because we are privy to his private moments and thoughts, the ways he justifies every overreach and horrible action. But to everyone else? He’s just a man, standing in front of a girl, patiently waiting for her to love him. He benefits from decades of cultural attitudes that have worn away at the agency of women, of romance tropes that valorize the persistence of men in pursuit of a woman, and the gendered head games that give men the upper hand in most every interaction they have. ,It does all this while also being extremely fun pulp nonsense, which somehow makes it feel ,dangerous. Throughout it all, Joe Goldberg is… funny? Sharp? And, thanks to Penn Badgley, perhaps the best voiceover narrator you’ve ever heard? You , Joe, and, because of a combination of Badgley’s performance and the incredible savvy of every member of the crew that points a camera or light at him, you frequently suffer whiplash for liking him, as he goes from charming book nerd to sardonic lead to super creep in the same shot. ,What we call prestige television is often a function of marketing. Prestige shows — the kind of stuff you see on HBO and sweeping the Emmys — involves a lot of putting on airs, signaling an intent to be literary or ambitious. , does no such thing. It is every inch the Lifetime show it began as, and just as wickedly sharp or thoughtful as another show with loftier goals. This makes , feel dangerous. Like it shouldn’t work so well. And then, when you start to think about why it does — well then, the show has you."
What to read and play after watching The Witcher on Netflix,"

        ",Andrew Webster,"So you’ve just finished watching Geralt grimace his way through eight episodes of ,. There’s a good chance you want more. Maybe it was the deep world-building that enticed you or all of the monster-hunting. Maybe it was Henry Cavill’s piercing yellow eyes. Either way, you’re in luck: you don’t have to wait for the second season to get more of Geralt. ,is based on a series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which also spawned a series of video games from CD Projekt Red so there is already a lot of , in the world to dive into. If you’re brand-new to the series, here are the best places to start.,The obvious place to start would be the very first , novel, ,, which,kicks off a lengthy storyline that spans six books. But if you’re coming to the books from the TV show, I’d recommend first delving into the short story collections, which predate the novels. There are two of them — , and ,— and both feature tales that form the basis for many of the show’s best episodes. The episode “Rare Species,” for instance, is based on the story “The Bounds of Reason” from ,, while the disturbing story “The Witcher” in , is the core of the episode “The Betrayer Moon.”,There are differences between the books and the show, of course. The Netflix series also weaves in an overarching story about warring kingdoms and the importance of destiny, which is largely absent from the short stories. But the two complement each other well, and they follow a similar structure, jumping back and forth in time with reckless abandon. In my opinion at least, , is at its best in this more standalone format, with Geralt investigating a new monster-related tragedy in each story. These two books will give you plenty of that.,You might be tempted to start from the beginning when it comes to the games. But I’d recommend sticking with the most recent entry in the series. Unlike books, games tend to age poorly, and this is particularly true for RPGs where quality-of-life updates can make older titles a chore to play through. But 2015’s , still feels fantastic today, and it’s the best — and most ambitious — entry in the series. It shifts things toward an open-world structure, and it’s filled with the same morally complex storytelling that makes the TV show so compelling. The two don’t cross over much, though; Netflix’s , is explicitly based on the books. And despite the three in the title, you don’t need to play the previous games to understand what’s going on.,Now is also the best time to play ,. For one thing, the game received two massive expansions, so if you’re just starting, you have , of video game in front of you. (The main story lasts dozens of hours on its own.) But it’s also very accessible. It’s available on a huge range of platforms, and it’s frequently on sale. Just yesterday, ,launched on Xbox Game Pass, making it free for subscribers to play. It’s even on the Nintendo Switch. While the Switch version suffers from a technical standpoint — the graphics and performance both take a hit on the smaller screen — much like , and other open-world games, , benefits greatly from being playable on the go where you can sneak in a quest or two in otherwise idle periods of time."

How to avoid Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker spoilers,"
          Dec 17, 2019,  2:35pm EST
        ",Cameron Faulkner,"The internet is full of spoilers, making it a dangerous place to hang around if you’re trying to steer clear of what happens in ,, ,, or any other TV shows, movies, or video games that you’re still catching up on. Even when you think you’ve got things under control, ,. ,, too. ,In addition, trolls can embed spoilers in unrelated content. When , was released, the film’s biggest plot twist was hidden within a misleading video titled something like “LMAO funny Madden 16 glitches.” (Needless to say, there were no funny , glitches to be found.),Of course, the most logical suggestion for avoiding them is to simply log off indefinitely, but that’s probably not going to happen.,There are several ways to remain spoiler-free without curtailing your computer or phone use. If you spend a ton of time on Twitter, ,. Facebook doesn’t allow for the filtering of specific keywords, although you can snooze groups that you follow for 30 days if there’s one whose participants usually share spoilers. ,If you want broader protection across the web, that comes in the form of browser extensions. With support for major browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, these let you draw the line on what you want to see online, and what you don’t.,You deserve to not be spoiled, and these extensions can help you out.,This extension can be installed on Chrome and Firefox (including Firefox on mobile phones), and it lets you add keywords that you want blocked wherever you go online. ,Once it’s installed, clicking into the extension opens up a window that lets you customize it. The page lets you add specific keywords to block, along with the action that you’d like performed when you stumble upon that keyword. You can also turn off images and videos associated with that keyword. ,Spoiler Protection 2.0 is , aggressive at blocking things, so that’s a good sign that it works. But with videos and photos switched off, it impacts more than just the content related to your spoiler keywords. YouTube still works, but most other photos and videos just stop loading at all. ,As my colleague Thomas Ricker put it ,, Unspoiler is the “scalpel” method of blocking spoilers online. Put up against Spoiler Protection 2.0, which is more of a blunt tool for eliminating any trace of a spoiler, this is a lighter, more precise solution. ,Once Unspoiler is activated in your Google Chrome browser, enter any keywords that you’d like to remain happily oblivious to. This extension does a good job of censoring headlines and blocking certain images related to your keywords. Chances are pretty good that you’ll remain spoiler-free, though it doesn’t block quite everything. A Google search, for instance, revealed several pictures, and website synopses aren’t covered up.,There are actually countless ways to block spoilers on your browser, but if you’re looking for a mobile solution, your options are more limited. Besides the aforementioned Spoiler Protection 2.0 add-on, the only other satisfactory one I found was an Android app called ,, which acts like Spoiler Protection 2.0 by applying a hard block of color over every page element that makes a mention of your spoiler keyword. It’s a bit drastic, though it’s cool that it can draw over every app you have installed on your phone.  ,Spoilers don’t bother everyone, but if you’re like me, you prefer to stay in the dark until you can enjoy a new movie, TV show, or game with fresh eyes. These extensions aren’t a perfect solution, but they’re definitely useful for keeping spoilers out of sight until you get caught up."

Mike Judge’s Silicon Valley take on power continues in Tales from the Tour Bus,"

For two seasons now, , has collected musicians’ wildest anecdotes about life on the road, playing alongside showbiz legends. Season 1 covered country music stars; season 2 focused on funk. The Morris Day episode is unusual, in that its true subject is really Day’s friend and rival, Prince. Each tale is introduced and narrated by ,/ , creator Mike Judge, who adds his own personal opinions and analysis, explaining who these performers are and what their music means.,Because Judge’s series , returns Sunday night on HBO.,This will be the sixth and final season for ,, which debuted in 2014 as the story of a socially awkward but innovative coder Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch), who persistently struggles against the oppressive demands of tech giants and the personal weaknesses of his own friends. Over the course of the past five years, Judge and his creative team — aided by an all-star cast of comic actors, including Martin Starr, Kumail Nanjiani, and Zach Woods — have commented on the madness of modern business, where genuinely visionary ideas get choked to death by legal snafus and copycats. The show expresses a deep , of technology, but a skepticism about the people in charge.,That’s very much in keeping with the worldview expressed in other Judge projects, like the movies , and ,, and the TV shows , and ,. Judge tends to see anyone with power — however petty and inconsequential the power might be — as something of a buffoon, inclined to egomania, insensitivity, and a lazy incuriosity about the world outside their sphere of influence. Judge has more sympathy with ordinary schmoes who just want to do a job they believe in for eight to 10 hours a day, then go home and play video games. He doesn’t see these regular folks as heroic. In his films and television shows, the powerless make just as many mistakes as the powerful.,Judge explores an insider / outsider dynamic in a lot of the episodes of ,, which look at stars like Waylon Jennings and James Brown through the eyes of the men and women who spent months and even years playing shows with them around the world, and thus saw them at their weirdest. In the case of the “Morris Day and The Time” episode, Judge and his interview subjects tell the story of a colorful Minneapolis R&B act who became famous thanks to their old pal Prince, who played alongside Day, Jellybean Johnson, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis when they were all starting out on the Twin Cities scene.,Prince produced the band, wrote most of their songs, and took them on the road as his opening act. In interviews with Johnson, Jam, Lewis, and Day, ,reveals that Prince also controlled The Time’s level of individual creativity, and even how popular the band could become. A big part of the story in this episode is about Day risking his career by rebelling against his mentor, and then reconciling with him shortly before Prince’s death.,Fans of , and backstage drama.,The animation is much stiffer in , than it is in ,, but the design is similarly flat and cartoony, like something out of an underground comic book. And it’s hard not to hear traces of Hank Hill when Judge narrates — he played Hill on primetime TV for more than a decade. Judge’s deliberate pace and clipped Texas twang lends a kind of folksy authority to his pronouncements about the heyday of funk in 1984, when the acts who debuted in the late 1970s were suddenly hobnobbing at the Grammys.,Judge also just knows a good story when he hears it. The “Morris Day and The Time” episode gets into the nutty origins of Day’s “mirror dance” routine (as seen in the movie ,) and his arm movements in the song “The Bird” (inspired by ,). The episode also features reminiscences about the days when The Time and Prince’s band The Revolution toured together, and tried to outplay each other every night. This particular tale is about the rich rock star with the state-of-the-art motor coach and the high-end after-show parties, vs. his buddies from the old neighborhood, who hosted debauched orgies after gigs, then piled onto a broken-down bus that always smelled like gasoline.

The Mandalorian shows why Star Wars should be smaller ,"

Eight weeks later and , is out, a very profitable ,, and , concludes its first season with a finale that doesn’t try for much, but also rocks. It is, surprisingly, the better Star War.,(Very mild spoilers to follow.),Most of the reasons why I like , boil down to restraint: It’s full of things most Star Wars movies , do. It doesn’t have a Jedi, or anyone who’s even , of the Force. It’s not about a Chosen One. It’s not even particularly concerned with its place in any grand narrative — sure, the show makes it easy to figure out that it’s set after , and there are a number of familiar , accoutrements. But its overall story? Very much doing its own thing. ,Let’s recap: The eponymous Mandalorian is a bounty hunter who takes a high-paying job for a former Imperial officer. That job turns out to be a child with special powers. He decides not to hand the child over to the definitely evil Imperial holdouts, and goes on the run. The stoic Mandalorian and the adorable baby have adventures, most of them aiming for you to say, “Hey, that’s cool” about two or three times per episode. ,I love how inconsequential , feels, especially since the , films have been about people doing Big Important Things involving the fate of the galaxy or whatever. It even ends with a reassertion of the status quo: Mando and The Child, out and about. What will they find next?,A big part of the , charm is the way that it feels like a world you can live in. And ,? It shows people just trying to get by, out in the galactic equivalent of a small midwestern farm town. Sure, the Empire has fallen and the New Republic is starting to get its feet (only to fall again by the time , rolls around) but none of that matters. Out here, they’re just trying to raise ugly lizards and gas up their spaceships so they can make it to the next job. ,Now that I’ve seen it, this is the , I want more of. Smaller stories, about smaller people, being noble or selfish in ways that ripple through their own communities, not the whole damn galaxy. It’s this implication at the heart of , that made that movie so compelling, and the diversions , made into the lives of Clone Troopers fascinating to watch.

Sony is shutting down its live TV service PlayStation Vue in January 2020,"

        ",Nick Statt,"Sony is shutting down its live TV streaming service PlayStation Vue on January 30th, 2020, the ,. The sudden announcement of the shutdown comes just a week after a ,saying Sony was looking for a buyer for the service, which has continually lost money for the company since its launch in March of 2015. Sony has repeatedly raised the price of Vue to try to offset its rising costs, most recently ,. ,“Unfortunately, the highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected. Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business,” Sony said in a blog post announcing the shutdown. “PlayStation fans can continue to access movie and TV content through the PlayStation Store on PS4 and via our partnerships with top entertainment apps.”,PlayStation Vue launched four years ago as an early competitor in the so-called pay-TV market, which is a restructured form of cable made popular by companies like Sling. Like most other vendors, Sony offered a skinny bundle of channels with the option to add more premium ones, like sports and entertainment channels, by paying a higher monthly subscription fee. After the price hike, the entry-level Vue plan cost about $50 a month. At its height, Vue amassed about 500,000 subscribers, which is far less than competitors like Sling and YouTube TV, , reported last week. ,Ultimately, it looks like Sony couldn’t make the economics work, as the cost of licensing cable channels far outweighed the money Sony could recoup on subscriptions. Vue’s demise is also a signal that customer interest in traditional cable bundles, skinny or otherwise, continues to shrink. As a result, major players in the entertainment industry are , to compete with Amazon and Netflix. That includes Disney with Disney+, Apple with Apple TV Plus, AT&T with HBO Max, and NBCUniversal with Peacock, among others. "
BoJack Horseman is its own harshest critic,"
          Oct 29, 2019, 10:54am EDT
        ",Jack Godwin,"Few of the viewers tuning into Netflix’s animated series , in 2014 could have anticipated how the series would evolve over the course of its six seasons to date. What began as a pun-filled send-up of celebrity culture and the media circus, set in a world full of anthropomorphic animals, soon presented a nuanced take on mental illness and the cycles of trauma. Before long, series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg was turning this critical eye to his own perceived failings.,From the start, ,was always introspective and prone to putting its characters’ behavior under the microscope. But as the series progressed, the scrutiny became far more intense. Bob-Waksberg eventually turned the show toward examining its own cultural impact, even questioning his desire to self-evaluate. The sixth season, which launched on Netflix on October 25th, continues this pattern of criticism, as the series’s protagonist, depressed former sitcom star BoJack Horseman (Will Arnett) begins his own journey to recovery, interrogating his behavioral patterns and revisiting trauma sites. More so than any fan or commentator, the show holds the top spot as its own harshest critic.,BoJack longs for a life as simple as the one in his former hit sitcom,, where every conflict was resolved in one episode, so everything could reset again. From the beginning, the series made it clear that this fantasy was incompatible with reality, and that BoJack’s refusal to deal with his problems was only going to make things worse. Although Bob-Waksberg set out to subvert viewer expectations, this subversion soon became routine. One woman BoJack dates even highlights this trend by asking him to “do that BoJack thing where you make a big deal over nothing and everyone laughs at you but at the same time relates, because you’re saying all the things polite society won’t.”,For the first few seasons, the show has its cake and eats it, too. Bob-Waksberg mines ,’s sitcom status for all its absurd comedy, such as BoJack’s best friend Todd (Aaron Paul) landing himself in a “two-dates-to-the-prom” situation with rival prison gangs. At other times, the show emphasizes that life rarely fits this structure, such as when BoJack’s former friend and , creator Herb (Stanley Tucci) rejects BoJack’s heartfelt apology, even on his deathbed. The series brings in sitcom tropes and structure to mock them, but also to seriously reflect BoJack’s damaged psyche. ,But from the second season onward, the writers became increasingly aware of their complicity in the sitcom-reset fantasy, and they worked harder to keep their stories from growing stagnant. The show started taking BoJack’s bad behavior to darker corners with plots where he’s caught with a friend’s 17-year-old daughter and a reckless drug-fueled bender with Sarah Lynn (Kristen Schaal), a former ,child actress who had gotten clean and sober. In the season 4 episode “The Old Sugarman Place,” he demolishes his family home in an attempt to “move forward” and return to Los Angeles. This forceful return to the status quo also reflected BoJack’s cycle of delusion and entitlement, as well as his inability to pull himself free from the quagmire of depression.,Dealing with thorny topics like trauma, privilege, mental illness, harassment, and substance abuse isn’t easy, especially when they have to be balanced with animal puns and goofy antics. (“Viva Toddfoolery!”) The writers frequently use comedy to provide catharsis amid tension or tragedy, with Todd getting into a ,caper in the same episode where feminist writer Diane (Alison Brie) faces the fallout of speaking out on sexual misconduct. But the creative team eventually cornered themselves by calling out the incompatibility between real life and sitcom structure, given that they’d set up a scenario where they needed sitcom structure to tell their stories.,By the third season, the episodic cycles of BoJack’s toxic, damaging behavior ran the risk of becoming repetitive and predictable. But the writers acknowledged the problem, with Todd calling out BoJack in the season 3 episode “It’s You”: “You can’t keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself as if that makes it okay — you need to be better!”,This isn’t just Todd pushing back against a friend who is all too ready to be forgiven. It’s the writers examining the impact of their show. It’s one thing to derive comedy from BoJack’s misanthropy, but allowing it to go unchallenged sets a dangerous precedent. Rather than shying away from the question, the creative team wrestled with their purpose as the series progressed. When BoJack plays gritty anti-hero detective Philbert in season 5, Diane questions whether such ultra-dark characters have a negative influence on the viewer. By extension, she’s implicating BoJack’s role within ,, and his effect on the Netflix viewership.,In season 1’s penultimate episode, BoJack asks Diane whether he’s a good person, and she answers with crushing silence. While she later tries to explain that no one is truly good or bad, and that “all you are is just the things that you do,” he still seeks to purge himself of the guilt he feels. Following his toxic mantra, “There’s always more show,” and taking some damaging advice that he should “keep running forward, no matter what,” BoJack avoids confronting his problems and insists he isn’t going to change. He sees Philbert — who he and Diane both helped bring to the screen — as a role model, playing into Diane’s fear that Philbert allows “dumb assholes to rationalize their own awful behavior.”,BoJack explains in the season 5 episode “Head in the Clouds” that Philbert teaches “We’re all terrible, so we’re all okay.” Diane, who is already struggling with her part in creating the show, is horrified by this interpretation, and points out that normalizing and rationalizing harmful behavior is dangerous. During this conversation, the show reaches one of its darkest and most self-critical points by bringing up BoJack’s relationship with Sarah Lynn. She saw him as a father figure even into her adult life as a pop star, but that became complicated when their relationship later turned sexual.,“I’m the one who has suffered the most because of the actions of BoJack Horseman,” he argues. Diane raises his unquestionable negative effect on Sarah Lynn as proof he’s wrong. “That’s been really hard for you, the main character in this story,” she says sarcastically. In one of its most merciless scenes, the writers reflect on their choice to empathize with a character like BoJack. They also seem to lament how they initially played BoJack’s sexual encounter with Sarah Lynn as a gag, and questions the cultural norms they were reinforcing.,Diane isn’t free from criticism, either. She’s often the show’s moral arbiter and its voice of reason, but she subjects herself to severe scrutiny, representing the show’s impulse to endlessly dissect its characters. Diane suggests we should be “asking more of ourselves and the people in our lives,” but she’s told she should also find ways to forgive herself and other people. ,is constantly striving for that balance.,Part of Diane’s self-examination may be inspired by the controversy surrounding her casting. Diane is Vietnamese-American, but she’s played by Caucasian actress Alison Brie. After a fan brought up the issue ,, Bob-Waksberg , he’d “soured on the idea of ‘color-blind’ casting as an excuse to not pay attention.” He later gave a , where he expressed “tremendous guilt” over the casting, and said his “understanding of [his] own responsibility” had changed. The same humble and honest outlook on guilt and responsibility underlies much of the show, especially in its later seasons. It’s notable that season 6 takes the time to answer fan ,, a Caucasian character with a Latinx surname, as if leaving no stone unturned.,The newly released first half of season 6 takes BoJack to rehab, in a recovery process that isn’t just about dealing with addiction, but about questioning the realities of forgiveness and personal change. Even the new opening credits see him passing through past regrets that still linger and threaten his future. A frequent refrain of the show brings together BoJack, seeing himself as a “stupid piece of shit,” and Diane, seeing herself as a “rudderless garbage barge.” They’re both trying their best to forgive each other because they can’t extend that same courtesy to themselves., often explores questions of forgiveness, both between people and between stars and their fans. We may find it easier to forgive BoJack’s mistakes than the unrepentant misogyny Hank Hippopopalous (Philip Baker Hall) exhibits in “Hank After Dark,” but the series has long since outgrown any simple ideas of heroes and villains. Secondary characters like Mr. Peanut Butter and Princess Carolyn — who initially served as counterpoints to BoJack’s pessimism and immaturity, respectively — become deeply flawed characters in their own right. Meanwhile, loathsome antagonists like Vanessa Gekko and Rutabaga Rabitowitz were revealed as the protagonists of their own stories.,As the show heads toward its finale, it’s still exploring that question BoJack asks Diane in season 1: is he a good person at heart, or is it too late for him? The sixth season shows that change is possible for BoJack, as he begins to make amends for the things he’s done, face addiction, and try to forgive himself. The self-examination that has taken place both within the story and in the writing room has demonstrated a maturity capable of tackling such broad and complicated issues. Rather than providing simple platitudes, the series brings its characters together through empathy rather than sympathy, and honesty over blind faith. Being its own harshest critic has let , evolve, and be the best version of itself."

It’s the one where Jason Momoa’s character picks up a book for the first time. Since the show is set centuries after a virus deprived humanity of sight, he has no idea what’s in his hands. He complains it smells like “dead bark” and holds it the way a toddler might hold a vegetable when they were in fact expecting a cookie. Then Alfre Woodard’s character demands he hand over what he’s found, and speaks its long-forgotten name: ,.,It’s extremely funny in context, and probably debilitating out of it. It also makes ,, Apple’s post-apocalyptic drama, one of my favorite kinds of shows: you could just plainly state something that happens in an episode, and everyone would swear you’re making it up. That doesn’t mean you should watch it. ,Set in the ruins of our world, the people of , have adjusted to a sightless life after centuries of practice. Makeshift curtains of beads make for boundaries both audible and physical, fights involve a lot of probing contact and grappling (as does sex), and there’s a lot of finger snapping. , is extremely invested in showing you how all this stuff works, so much so that it barely delves into its characters. ,Baba Voss (Jason Momoa) is a man who must take his family on the run after his adopted twins, Kofune and Haniwa, are born with sight. The trouble is, the very idea of sight is heretical — much like witchcraft in colonial America, troublesome people are accused of having the ability to see as justification for burning them alive. And there’s also an evil queen who learns of the twins, and as a religious zealot who worships the “darkness” (by, and I will testify to this in court if I have to, masturbating as she prays) she wants them brought to her for evil queen reasons. ,A generous and forgiving read of , could interpret it as an attempted meditation on knowledge, ignorance, and responsibility, but ,actively resists attempts to latch on to anything of substance it might have to offer.

The third episode, the best of that initial bunch, is largely unconcerned with the season’s main arc, instead telling a story where Kofune is kidnapped by slavers and must be rescued. It’s visually striking, introducing a tribe of people that, unbeknownst to them, are living in the ruins of an amusement park. It’s got a killer fight scene, with unique choreography that clearly conveys the limitations and skills of everyone involved and depicts brutal violence with grace and skill. And it’s got personal stakes, which I won’t spoil here because it’s one of the only bits of character backstory you get in the first couple of episodes. ,None of these things make , a more interesting show beyond the hour you spend watching them. It’s cotton candy, a fun confection for one moment, and just plain sugar the next. , is clearly interested in drawing people into its elaborate and well-crafted post-apocalypse, but it’s telling that the only questions I have after watching are purely pedantic ones. Like how did a blind society make such perfect and deadly weapons, or build homes that never leak, or clothes and makeup that look so nice? ,These are questions asked by jerks and spoilsports, and I wish I had better ones to ask of ,. The show is strange, but fails to justify that strangeness with a compelling story, characters, or literally anything other than the list of ideas you and your stoned cousin would come up with if you wondered what it would be like if we all woke up one day totally blind, man.

        ",Kevin Nguyen,"In Ronan Farrow’s book ,, which details how the former NBC News correspondent pieced together his Pulitzer-winning reporting about Harvey Weinstein, the first menacing figure we meet isn’t actually Weinstein. It’s Matt Lauer. Farrow’s reporting took place (about a year) before allegations of sexual assault would be leveled against the venerable ,anchor. At the beginning of ,, Farrow details a meeting he had with Lauer, one of the few people at NBC supportive of the Weinstein story. Feeling reassured by the encouragement of the network’s biggest figure, Farrow leaves Lauer’s office, and notices a peculiar thing: a button under the desk that closes the door behind him.,, the mega-expensive prestige drama launching on Apple TV Plus, imagines the aftermath of a beloved anchor felled by the revelations of his sexual misconduct. The allegations are not as severe as Lauer’s — the show , its audience all sex was consensual — but it’s hard not to see him in the character of Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), repeatedly referred to as the “dad” of morning news and donning a name that even sounds like a bizarro-universe Matt Lauer.,It is not Kessler but his co-host Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) who has to deal with the fallout immediately. They’ve been on , together for nearly two decades — the mom and dad of America for a program with the tagline “Start your day with your family”— and Alex scrambles to figure out how to address the news of her fired co-host, and who will replace him. To further matters, Alex is deeply concerned about her own contract with the show being renewed, which makes you wonder if the most important question here is whether she can keep her job., is a confounding series full of actors you like, none of whom seem particularly thrilled to be there. In addition to Carell and Aniston, Reese Witherspoon plays Bradley Jackson, a small-time news anchor with the least convincing southern accent I’ve heard since Cindy in ,. A clip of her screaming at a coal protest goes viral, and through a series of bewildering decisions by Alex and her boss, Bradley is suddenly in the running to replace Mitch.,Mitch, by the way, is far from cast off in the show. ,explores how one might wrestle with the repercussions of being Me Too’d. That turns out to be little more complicated than watching Carell bash a flat screen TV out of anger, and then later, unbelievably, tell an old colleague, “At first they came for the rapists, and I said nothing.” That’s probably the nadir of ,’s writing, the rest of it largely — if not clumsily — functional, but Carell does himself no favors by confusing awkward yelling with compelling acting. (In fact, his tantrums are not far off from his character in ,.) ,The only actor on , who seems to be having any fun is Billy Crudup as Cory Ellison, a caricature of a network exec. Still, he moves through the show effortlessly with a smarmy charm (schmarm?), even though his motivations are more inscrutable than they are Machiavellian. At one point, Crudup shouts “chaos is the new cocaine,” and he almost gets away with it.,Most of the dialogue involves characters announcing how they feel. When they’re not, it sounds like they’re telling jokes without punchlines, like when Levy says, “People are idiots. Am I right?” At times, you can sense the show’s aspirations to be something of the Aaron Sorkin universe, except it possesses none of Sorkin’s strengths (the briskly paced chattiness; frequent levity) and most of his weaknesses (a privileged, navel-gazing sense of self-righteousness; the attempts at inclusion that end up feeling kind of racist). The show even looks deeply bland, which honestly might be the most refreshing non-decision in a world where every streaming show is basked in moody, saturated colors or attempts to evoke realism by shooting on handheld cameras.,Similarly, you could also describe the politics of , as glossy and uncomplicated. Predictably, the fight for journalism is basically divided between good, salt-of-the-earth folks like Bradley and greedy, cynical execs like Cory. At one point, the argument is so stark that Cory says, in all seriousness, “What we really need on television right now — it’s not news, or fucking journalism. It’s entertainment.” (Again, somehow Crudup sells this without batting an eye. Give this handsome man an Emmy!),Still, Jackson and Ellison’s dynamic is the show’s most intriguing one — a strength of on-screen chemistry — even if it is still situated in a very basic idea of an employee being real spunky with her boss. In fact, , constantly addresses the notion of power and who has it, but never seems interested in how or why. Network execs are powerful because they’re at the top. Anchors like Levy have power, too, because they’re famous and in front of cameras (though the show finds the most improbable ways for her to wield it). ,But for a series that wants to run at Me Too, it has little to no curiosity in how bad behavior is ignored, allegations are suppressed, or the people and institutions that keep it this way. Farrow’s book revealed the insidious and very deliberate ways men like Weinstein, Lauer, and Tom Brokaw could protect themselves through intimidation and NDAs. In ,, everyone is just too dang earnest, or really, too selfish to think about anyone but themselves.,Even the time we spend with Mitch, whose arc is unclear (though my hope is that it goes in the direction of “acceptance” rather than “redemption”), feels unearned. We get scenes like the one where he struggles to work the Keurig machine in his home. He gets frustrated, then furious, but eventually figures out how to operate the very simple coffee machine. And we’re supposed to feel… what exactly? It’s unclear. It seems fitting that , is the key launch title for Apple’s major foray into original content. This is a company that values simplicity, clarity, and loves smooth corners so much that they designed their headquarters to be completely without rough edges.,There are hints of promise, though. At the end of the third episode, the last that was screened in advance to critics, a producer, Mia Jordan (Karen Pittman), wanders into the now-vacant office of Mitch Kessler. She admires his things, gazes in the mirror, and locates a button under the desk. The door of the office closes. The short scene suddenly gives , a sense of menace and foreboding that had been missing for the previous three hours. Mia then goes to Levy’s office to confront her about how complicit she was in Mitch’s behavior. And suddenly , has its first interesting moment, because it finally wants things to be messy."

Circumventing Apple’s idea of what a prestigious show should look like brings some much needed carefreeness to the streaming platform.  ,The show finds Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld) in the 1850s as she struggles to follow her dreams of becoming a poet at a time when female writers were frowned upon. Her father Edward (Toby Huss) sours at the idea of people in Massachusetts finding out she’s a writer, afraid of the shame she’ll bring to their family. Only two people support her ambitious desires: George Gould (Samuel Farnsworth), a local literary magazine editor who also wants to marry Emily, and Sue Gilbert (Ella Hunt), her best friend turned secret lover.,Using period-accurate costumes and sets gives it a slightly prestigious feel, but the dialogue is deliberately contemporary.

The backstage melodrama stars Jennifer Aniston as a veteran network TV news anchor who fights for her job and tussles with a new rival (Reese Witherspoon) when her longtime co-host (Steve Carell) is fired for sexual misconduct.

Beginning in 1970, , built a devoted audience with its sophisticated, funny take on the everyday grind of turning out a local news telecast — and with its depiction of the toll the job takes on one independent woman. Mary Richards had her share of romantic subplots during the run of the show, but the writers (including Silverman, one of the few women in the room) were far more interested in her friendships and in how she navigated a stressful, fast-paced workplace., was especially good at contrasting Mary with the other women in her life. “Assistant Wanted, Female” opens with her sharing breakfast with her best pal Rhoda, a wisecracking cynic, stressing out about her diet. (“Just a 70-calorie hard-boiled egg for ol’ tubbo,” Rhoda says of herself, before giving in to temptation and having toast with jam.) Both of them bristle at Phyllis, who swoops into Mary’s apartment looking well-dressed and perfectly coiffed, boasting about “being a model wife and a perfect mother.” (“She’s going to give overbearing, aggressive women a bad name,” Rhoda gripes.) As Mary strives to be taken seriously at work, she sees reflections of herself in her two friends: the one who gets on everyone’s nerves because she tries too hard and the one who stays primed for disappointment by treating everything as a joke.,Anyone interested in tracking the transitions women have experienced in the workplace, and in media, in particular.,“Assistant Wanted, Female” arrived early in ,’s run when Mary was still trying to find her bearings at the fictional Minneapolis station WJM.

Because she takes this job mostly as a lark, Phyllis has a lackadaisical attitude toward her clerical assignments and working hours. When Mary chastises her for embarrassing her in front of Mr. Grant, Phyllis assumes her friend is just jealous and wonders if she should’ve dressed more “dowdy,” so as not to overshadow Mary.

For a movie, it’s often better to simplify.,There are some lovely moments in the movie, though.

The movie comes out December 13th.,Disney+ comes out in just over a week, and this week we’re getting a look at another of its debut series.

The tactic would be a way to win over on-the-fence directors and producers who might be shopping a project around at multiple streaming services, while also entertaining the idea of a traditional theatrical release.,According to ,, the bonus idea is still being debated internally, but it could be a costly change in strategy for Netflix.

Yet the most interesting part of the evening wasn’t necessarily who won, but the commercials for major streaming services that played between acceptance speeches, a signal of how stretched out TV is about to become. ,The ads were louder this year. The Emmys, airing this year on Fox, were full of commercial spots for ,, ,, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix. There were a few scattered promotions for standard broadcast networks, including commercials for new series like ,and network favorites like ,, but it was a streaming service’s world. Apple used the Emmys evening to ,; Disney kicked off the evening by securing the first commercial break, playing a new commercial for Disney+ and ,.,Even people at the Emmys poked fun at the incoming war for people’s money. Comedian Thomas Lennon started off his evening announcing the awards show by cracking a joke about the real battle of the evening being between HBO Now’s $14.99 subscription fee and Netflix’s $12.99 price. HBO won when it came to award numbers (nine), but it was closely followed by Amazon (five) and Netflix (four). As , ,’ Kyle Buchanan ,, this year’s “Emmy telecast is really making the case against television.” ,Or maybe a case against a , era of television. TV is getting bigger, and trying to catch everything is becoming more difficult. The plethora of commercials for streaming services last night was a stark reminder that in order to be in the cultural conversation for the next few Emmy ceremonies, after newcomers like Disney, Apple, and maybe even Quibi enter the race, people will have to subscribe, subscribe, subscribe. That’s on top of shelling out for services from Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu. And that doesn’t account for possible contenders on , or ,. As ,, “In many ways, this year’s Emmys feels like the end of one TV era, as the farewells of ,and ,remove two dominant HBO players from the competition.” ,Talking about the , a catch-all term to describe the mob of new services coming out within the next eight months, has largely been focused on price. How much will it cost to have two subscriptions? Three? All of them? Other conversations have focused on high-bid exclusives. Netflix reportedly paid more than $500 million for ,, WarnerMedia supposedly paid $425 million ,, and NBCUniversal apparently ,. Last night’s Emmys opened a new conversation about the streaming wars: the cultural cost of not keeping up with every hot show on every single service. ,It’s already happening. A quick anecdote: After the Emmys ended, I texted my mother, an avid TV watcher and longtime awards show fan, to ask if any of her favorite shows won. With the exception of NBC’s ,and Netflix’s ,, she hadn’t watched any of the shows. She doesn't watch HBO shows, and with the exception of Netflix, she doesn’t subscribe to any services. No Hulu or Amazon Prime Video; and there’s no interest to purchase a plan for Apple TV Plus, Disney+, Peacock, or any other service. It’s becoming more difficult for her to be part of the conversation as the future of TV moves away from TV. ,Broadcast is still fighting to remain relevant, and still producing series worthy of attention. This week alone, NBC, ABC, Fox, and CBS are set to debut 64 shows. It’s a callback to event television, harkening back to an era before companies like Amazon and Apple were included in television awards show conversations. It’s a facet of competing for attention that , are also thinking about. ,Television has changed from decade to decade. There used to just be a few broadcast networks, then cable became a thing. That was followed by premium cable and, now, streaming services. The evolution of how people watch TV isn’t surprising. The difference between various broadcast networks, premium cable dominating television viewing, and streaming is how we watch. Streaming removes the channel flipping aspect, where different shows on different networks could be found simply by clicking through. Now, networks and companies are asking subscribers to visit one specific service and stay there. If someone only subscribes to one or two services, the chance they’ll see a show people are talking about decreases substantially. ,The Emmys as an awards show will still look the same in years to come — dramas and comedies will be nominated; actors, writers, and directors will show up to make their speeches. But how many of those shows will people recognize? Or how many will they have watched? Everything is shifting; ,’,send-off last night acted as a reminder that television can be a beautiful communal affair, but that changes when TV gets more spread out and exclusive through different streaming services. There are about to be more shows than ever thanks to new entrants like Apple, Quibi, and Disney+. How many future nominated series people watch will largely depend on how many streaming services they’re willing to pay for — or what they decide to pirate. Not everyone will subscribe to every service, and no one has the time to watch everything. ,If the Emmys no longer reflect what the majority of people are watching, because people are sticking to two or three streaming services, what purpose does the show serve? The Emmy Awards already feel like a show by industry people for industry people — talking about how to make the Emmys more appealing as a show is an entirely different piece — but if audiences are divided even more by streaming silos, a bigger question becomes why should anyone care if they don’t recognize a big portion of the nominated series?"

Grant, Stephen Fry, Clive Owen, Emily Watson, Kelly Macdonald, and Ryan Phillippe — playing 1930s rich folks and servants, gathered for a weekend of dining and hunting that gets interrupted by their host’s suspicious death. Altman and Fellowes have fun with the rigidity of the British class system and the arcane rituals of service — just as Fellowes would do again a decade later with the creation of hit TV series ,.,Because the feature film version of , arrives in theaters across the United States this weekend.,Fellowes’ visually splendid, addictively melodramatic series became a sensation when it debuted on ITV in 2010 and then on PBS in the US in 2011. Over the course of its six seasons, , covered roughly 15 years in the life of the landed, aristocratic Crawley family as well as their servants and tenants. Set between 1912 and 1926, the show charts how the turbulence of the early 20th century — the wars, economic booms and busts, and various progressive social causes — eroded England’s old order, closing the curtain on an era when only the idle rich could dictate how their country was run.,The 2015 series finale left the door open for more stories about the Crawleys. The ,movie is set in 1927, and it uses the hubbub of a royal visit as a way to catch fans up on what the family and their employees have been up to since the show ended. The two-hour film — running just a little less than the length of three TV episodes — mixes the show’s usual wry humor and exaggerated intrigue into an examination of how even the honor of hosting a king and queen could come to mean something different in a decade marked by pro-democratic and anti-colonialist movements.,From the start, , won acclaim for its lavish re-creations of period fashions and decor. But the show’s massive popularity was just as attributable to its soapy plots, which dealt with forbidden romance, sexual indiscretion, and yes, murder. In that way, the series was a natural successor to ,. (, was originally developed as a TV version of , before Fellowes decided to take the project in a different direction.) On a narrative level, the 2001 Altman movie is like several episodes of the series: over the course of its 137 minutes, it gradually reveals shocking secrets about the relationships between the servants and their employers, while exposing the many sins of the estate’s lord, stabbing victim Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon).,Tonally, , is very different from ,, thanks largely to Altman. The director had only five years left to live when he made this film, and, at the time, he had recently received a heart transplant. Late in his career, Altman entered a gentler phase, losing a lot of the satirical bite and acerbic cynicism of his earlier movies and replacing them with a genuine affection for watching talented actors do their work. For a film about homicide and class conflict, , is surprisingly congenial.,Anglophiles and Altman fans.,The late, great Robert Altman believed the director’s job was to create a sense of reality — not ,, per se, but a belief within the audience that the world they were seeing extended beyond the bounds of stage or screen. Altman moved the camera restlessly, giving the impression that there was always more to look at than he had the capacity to show. He encouraged his casts to improvise as much as they wanted and to keep talking even when they weren’t the focus of a scene, just in case they ended up in one of his long, drifting shots.,’s cast of theater-trained veterans stayed fairly faithful to Fellowes’ words, aside from some off-handed remarks at the edges of the frame. But Altman and the actors still foster an illusion of spontaneity through their relaxed line-deliveries and subtly reactive facial expressions. (Dame Maggie Smith, who went on to star in ,, does as much with an arched eyebrow and a forced smile as she does with Fellowes’ witty quips.) , has sometimes been criticized as reactionary, as Fellowes appears to pine for the vanished England where everyone knew their place. But there isn’t much nostalgia in ,, which feels deeply lived-in and populated by people who appear exhausted by the burdens of their stations.,is airing on Showtime this month, so it’s available via the Showtime streaming service. To catch up with ,, meanwhile, turn to Amazon Prime Video, which is also the home of Fellowes’ first post-,television project, an entertaining miniseries adaptation of Anthony Trollope’s novel ,."

"In season 4, The Good Place goes back to its strengths","
          Sep 26, 2019,  1:54pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"The Good Place.,NBC’s cosmic comedy , started in 2016 as a quirky fantasy sitcom starring Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop, a self-proclaimed “Arizona dirtbag” who winds up in the titular heavenly realm due to a clerical error. Her attempts to avoid being detected and booted to the Bad Place didn’t seem sustainable as a long-term story — but that’s because they were never meant to be. Instead, ,creator Michael Schur and his team defied sitcom traditions by constantly reinventing the show over the course of three seasons, taking the characters through a version of Dante’s ,that ventured to absurdist versions of heaven, hell, and places in between.,That ambition let , deliver some incredible plot twists and biting comedy, but it didn’t always work out. Season 3 suffered from whiplash as it changed the frame and stakes too much. The season started out by questioning whether people could improve themselves after having near-death experiences. Then it had the protagonists acting as bodhisattvas, forsaking their own redemption to help others. Then they wound up fighting to correct a broken system that doomed every human to eternal torment. Without a focused narrative, the humor dulled into a series of gags, propped up by guest stars who overstayed their welcome.,The end of season 3 set up a course correction for the series and its cosmology, bringing the characters back to the Good Place neighborhood where the show started. Schur tasked them with trying to redeem the souls of four dead people, and through them, all humanity. The return to familiar turf works beautifully as the show moves into its fourth and final season, setting up plenty of funny and sweet callbacks. It also shows how much the characters have grown, and how far they’ll still have to go to achieve their goals.,Season 4 picks up immediately after the season 3 finale. Eleanor has taken on the role of the neighborhood’s divine architect, though the cosmic suburb is actually being held together by the near-omniscient artificial being Janet (D’Arcy Carden). They’re joined by the reformed demon Michael (Ted Danson), the perpetually name-dropping socialite Tahani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil), and the dumb but endearing troublemaker Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto) on a mission to prove that four humans can change for the better, even if they were bad people throughout their lives.,That’s no easy task, given that the damned souls the crew is out to redeem include John Wheaton (Brandon Scott Jones), a gossip columnist chosen by the Bad Place to torment Tahani. Even more challenging is Brent Norwalk (Ben Koldyke), a living embodiment of white male privilege who drops random jabs at ,into rants about political correctness. He also wants to know why he isn’t spending eternity with a list of buddies that’s clearly modeled off the group of hard-partying high-school friends that surrounded Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The team is also one member down, after indecisive philosophy professor Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper) agreed to have his memories erased to help his season 3 love interest, neurologist Simone Garnett (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). ,Putting the characters back in their old neighborhood lets them revisit earlier plots and behaviors from a new perspective. Eleanor feels almost like Bethany Sloane in ,, a normal person saddled with saving the world while still grappling with her own insecurities. Michael, who held the architect role in the first and second seasons as a means of getting humans to emotionally torture each other, has stepped back to let Eleanor shine, but he still delivers some wonderful inspirational speeches that remind viewers of his old wicked ways. His salvation in previous seasons might have seemed rushed, but this season, he’s quick to remind viewers that he knows the other characters so well because he studied the best ways to hurt them.,Tahani is also clearly still struggling to let go of the insecurities that damned her. While her best moments will always involve sharing ludicrous celebrity-laden anecdotes, she has some genuinely touching moments bonding with John by showing how a desire for status can hurt people on both sides of the velvet rope. The writers are also working hard to find more to do with Jason, the cast’s least improved player. He delivers some great laughs in his trashier interactions with Eleanor, but as of episode 4 of the new season, he’s clearly on a path that will push his character to catch up with his compatriots’ growth. (NBC made the first four episodes of the 14-episode season available to critics before the premiere.),Wiping Chidi’s memory lets the show bring back the neurotic, anxious version of the character that Eleanor eventually fell in love with, and it sets up a major conflict, as she’s forced to put aside her feelings for him and drive him and Simone together for the good of the group’s moral experiment. ,has always spent a lot of time dwelling on philosophy, but the overt lectures have taken a back seat this season, aside from Chidi getting Simone to accept that she’s in the afterlife, not just undergoing a complicated hallucination while dying. That scene is a sweet moment that rekindles the strong chemistry the actors had in season 3, even if it does mark an end to Simone’s hilarious attempts to prove she’s dreaming, which include showing up to a fancy party wearing foam hands.,Season 4 has fewer scenes in actual classrooms, but the show’s philosophical underpinnings are still key. The focus has shifted to utilitarianism, with both Eleanor and Chidi sacrificing their personal happiness for the greater good. Agents of the Bad Place, led by Michael’s vengeful but acerbic former boss Shawn (Marc Evan Jackson), are trying to stymie the protagonists’ experiment at every turn, but the show hints at a possible compromise that would be in everyone’s best interests.,In season 1, the main characters become better people because they’re being tortured, and have to work together to help each other. When Chidi is stripped of responsibility and anxiety in the new version of the neighborhood, he rests on his laurels. He only starts to help others when he’s pushed into a situation that makes him deeply uncomfortable. In that way, , suggests that people behave better when they’re uncomfortable, and that the best outcome for humanity might involve at least a little pain. (Just not the Bad Place’s ideal of an eternity of repeated dick-flattening and reinflating.),In season 4, the dialogue feels a bit sharper than it did in season 3. And episode 4, “Tinker, Tailor, Demon, Spy,” comes the closest the show’s gotten to its highest point: season 2’s episode “The Trolley Problem.” The new episode has the usual splashes of absurdist humor, most notably a Pictionary drawing that comes to life as a nightmare creature. But it becomes a bottle episode that delves into the show’s fragile group dynamics, the nuances of its cosmology, and the strengths and weaknesses of individual characters, all by confronting the crew with the possibility that they have a Bad Place spy among them.,The writers clearly thought through all the easy ways out of the problem, building a conflict that explores the ethics of lying and the potential for redemption, while also leaving plenty of room for hilarious gags like Jason being way too eager to see Michael’s horrifying demonic form. It’s ,at its best, using a moral dilemma to force its dysfunctional cast of characters to work together, and cutting what could be a saccharine moral with barbed jokes and startling twists. If the rest of the season can deliver more episodes of that caliber, then the show will be able to save itself from its season 3 purgatory and return to the divine heights it’s capable of reaching."

        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,, a 1999 political satire directed by Alexander Payne and co-written by Payne and Jim Taylor, adapting Tom Perrotta’s novel of the same name. Set in an Omaha, Nebraska high school, the film stars Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick, an energetic overachiever who irritates her smugly idealistic history teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) with her aggressive self-promotion.,“Mr. M” sees Tracy as emblematic of a strain of prissy privilege, deleterious to the great American experiment. Chris Klein plays affable, dim jock Paul Metzler, whom McAllister encourages to enter the race for class president against Flick. Jessica Campbell plays Paul’s lesbian sister Tammy, who becomes the spoiler. , examines the simmering desperation of one middle-aged Middle American teacher, while also commenting on how even the least important political campaigns can devolve into shallow posturing and mudslinging.,Because the ,-esque series ,is now available on Netflix.,Co-created by , producers Ian Brennan, Brad Falchuk, and Ryan Murphy — a team that’s worked in various combinations on the TV series ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and ,, among others — , stars Tony-winning Broadway actor Ben Blatt as Payton Hobart, an upper-class Santa Barbara teen hoping to use a high school election as a springboard toward his larger political goals.

The series comments on the superficiality of modern politics, but in a way that’s colorful and cartoonish, with a broadly comic take on privilege and popularity, not bogged down by wonky real-world details. , isn’t exactly a docudrama either, but while its characters are also comical (and rooted in stereotypes), the movie is predominantly about the daily grind of middle-class existence. Payne and Taylor let each of their main characters tell their part of the story via overlapping narration to illustrate the distance between their self-image and their actual behavior and also to mitigate the bitter undertones of McAllister and Flick’s voices with the relative sweetness of the Metzler siblings.,This story, though, is mainly about Mr. M, who teaches the same tedious facts every year, then goes home to his wife’s bland dinners and his secret stash of pornography. McAllister has a lot of options about morality and ethics, but his firmly held convictions don’t keep him from inviting his wife’s best friend to sleep with him — and at an American Family Inn, no less. Payne and Taylor are simultaneously empathetic toward and critical of a man who overestimates his own importance, interfering with a meaningless election in hopes of saving the world from Tracy Flick.,Broderick gives a wonderfully nebbishy performance, and the filmmakers do a fine job of using visual cues to define the smallness of his world — like the recurring image of his automatic seat belt, slowly wrapping tightly around his body every time he gets into his car.,Political junkies and Reese Witherspoon fans.,Witherspoon had a strong start to her career, giving a handful of well-received performances when she was still in her teens and early 20s. , showed off her knack for comedy and for playing larger-than-life, often unapologetically brash characters. Her ferocious Tracy (whose printed last name, “FLICK,” looks pointedly rude in certain typefaces) is a lonely soul with a megalomaniacal bent, for whom the American education system is less about accumulating knowledge and more about running up the score on her transcript.,Payne and Taylor, meanwhile, have fun mocking the drudgery of high school and the pointlessness of high school elections. Mr. M imagines the ritual as an exercise in democracy: it’s the freedom to choose between apples and oranges, he says, as he draws both fruits on a chalkboard as featureless circles. When Paul then astutely notes that his fondness for either apples or oranges varies depending on the day, that’s a funny, pointed metaphor for the fickleness of the American electorate.,Tubi and Vudu are both currently streaming , for free (with commercials). It’s also worth seeking out Payne and Taylor’s 1996 debut feature, ,, which satirizes the abortion debate via the story of a wastrel (hilariously played by Laura Dern) who becomes a national cause célèbre after she gets pregnant.

Netflix’s superhero drama Raising Dion struggles to find a Stranger Things balance,"
          Sep 30, 2019,  4:19pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"A young hero must learn to use his exceptional powers to stop a terrible threat and save his friends, family, and possibly the entire world. It’s a pretty typical setup for a superhero origin story, but Netflix’s new series ,, which launches its nine-episode first season on October 4th, changes things up by making its hero a seven-year-old. Splicing family drama with comic-book action produces some engaging story beats, but the friction between the two genres eventually makes the show fall apart., follows Nicole Warren (Alisha Wainwright), who’s left raising Dion (Ja’Siah Young) alone after his brilliant meteorologist father Mark (Michael B. Jordan of ,and ,) drowns saving a woman’s life. When Dion starts moving objects with his mind, Nicole realizes it’s really going to take a village to raise this kid, and she turns to friends, family, and more unlikely allies to help train and protect him.,While Jordan’s star power and boundless charisma is unfortunately limited to flashbacks and the occasional supernatural vision, creator / writer Carol Barbee has assembled a wonderful cast centered on the show’s charming, precocious title character. Young brings a powerful sense of joy and innocence to Dion as he discovers the extent of his powers and strives to use them to help others. He’s absolutely adorable as he sets about designing his own costume and Fortress of Solitude, which takes the form of a pillow fort in his room. The only sour note is the amount of product placement involved in his tendency to use his abilities to acquire his favorite name-brand snack foods.,Those powers add an extra layer to the traditional family-drama conflicts between Dion and Nicole who’s struggling to maintain a job and care for her son. Mark’s death has forced them to move out of a more affluent neighborhood and sent Dion to a new school where he struggles to fit in, both as a nerdy kid who loves science and comic books and as one of the few black students. ,One of the show’s most poignant episodes centers on an incident where Dion uses his telekinesis to stop skater bully Jonathan (Gavin Munn) from running off with his father’s watch. In a clear sign of racial bias, the principal blames Dion for the fight, forcing Nicole to talk with her son both about using his powers responsibly and about the hard life he’s likely to have ahead of him because of his skin color.,Barbee skillfully addresses the complicated social issues around racism and single parenthood, but she brings in plenty of humor to keep the story from getting too heavy. One of the main sources of comedy is Dion’s godfather Pat (Jason Ritter) who uses his knowledge of comic books to serve as a mentor while fighting with Nicole about his tendency to spoil the kid. Dion’s classmate Esperanza (Sammi Haney), who uses a wheelchair, fuses the show’s social consciousness and silliness. She wistfully talks about the pain of being invisible to the rest of the school, while forcefully pushing herself into the role of his new best friend. She also makes sure Dion’s fortress is up to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.,These grounded, personal conflicts add depth to ,’s superhero fare, which is more boilerplate. Dion is pursued by a monster he dubs “the Crooked Man,” which is apparently killing other people with powers, in the style of ,’ Sylar or ,’s Whispers. The creature’s look appears to have been modeled after the Mind Flayer from , and ,also pays homage to Netflix’s smash hit about kids dealing with the supernatural by setting its theme as Pat’s ringtone. When Nicole and Pat want to understand the nature of both the threat and Dion’s abilities, they dig into Mark’s research for Biona, the science and technology company where he and Pat worked together. At times, that group seems just as shady as the various government operations running the show in ,.,In attempting to give equal time to family drama and science fiction, Barbee,doesn’t fully develop either. An episode meant to establish Nicole’s complicated relationship with her older, more successful sister Kat (Jazmyn Simon) feels flat because so much character development is forced into a single episode. When push comes to shove, Kat is willing to sacrifice her career and romantic relationship for Nicole and Dion, but that loss loses its sting since so little time is spent on showing what those things mean to her.,The issue is even worse when it comes to the complexities of the superhero plot. A major twist is telegraphed early enough that it’s not particularly surprising when it happens, but Barbee never devotes the time to explaining why or how it happens, making the shift feel jarringly abrupt. It’s particularly frustrating since the first season’s final episode includes a flashback to Nicole meeting Mark, which is sweet, but it easily could have come earlier in the show, leaving space for showing why events suddenly come to a head and how the story reached this point.,The climax is also watered down by the dual mandate to have Nicole’s personal plot reach its own conclusion. It’s discordant to watch her get so excited about finally earning health insurance and rekindling her passion for dancing right as her son is being threatened by a murderous monster. Late in the season, , brings up unusually powerful points about male entitlement and accepting boundaries. It directly confronts traditional TV plots, but, again, it’s brought up and resolved so quickly that it loses the intended impact.,Integrating personal dramas into comic-book stories is nothing new. That balance is at the heart of the CW’s slate of superhero soap operas, and it defines Peter Parker’s struggles to manage high school while he’s fighting supervillains. But the distance ,creates between the two elements by centering the story on the hero’s normal mother makes the show feel disjointed. Spider-Man’s plots can come to a head when he has to save a bus with his classmates on it, but there’s no reason for Nicole’s maybe-love-interest dance instructor to show up anywhere near the final showdown with the Crooked Man.,The mundane nature of the personal dramas in , creates further dissonances with the big stakes of its comic-book elements. The CW shows boost soap opera drama to superhero levels work by making the personal plotlines as outsized as the action, as characters learn that close relatives are secret supervillains or time-travelers. ,is clearly trying to mimic , with its intergenerational conflicts and focus on how relationships grow and change in the face of the unknown, but that show’s ensemble nature makes it easier to have a lot of smaller stories that only coalesce during the setpiece finish. After a decidedly underwhelming climax, ,teases its next season by setting up an even more trite cliffhanger. There’s certainly potential in the show’s premise and charming cast, and in its ambitious attempts to address issues that superhero stories normally avoid. But in order to succeed, the writers will need to find a better balance between the disparate parts."
Transparent’s musical finale lays out the series’ intent and its legacy,"
          Oct  1, 2019, 12:58pm EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"About halfway through ,’s movie-length series finale, which hit Amazon on September 27th, the feisty Shelly Pfefferman (played by Judith Light) sings a song to her judgmental middle-aged children called “Your Boundary Is My Trigger,” where she uses the kids’ own language against them. She says that every time they block her from commenting on or meddling in their lives, she considers it a personal assault because it’s like they’re convicting her of bad parenting without letting her mount a defense. The moment is classic ,, playfully interrogating modern therapy-speak, while also understanding that when troubled people finally own their feelings, the process can hurt others.,The scene is also, frankly, kind of hard to watch, because the song itself is so clumsy and corny. But then that’s true to ,, too.,Throughout the show’s first four seasons, creator Jill Soloway took huge chances not just with ,’s storytelling, but with its characters. Soloway was never afraid to let the members of the Pfefferman family come off as whiny or self-absorbed, because that was the whole point of the series. ,suggests that working toward becoming a better person sometimes forces people to elevate personal needs over the comfort and complacency of a group. But that wrenching kind of change ultimately affected , itself, as behind-the-scenes drama and larger cultural trends affected the way even longtime fans saw the show.,It’s impossible to discuss ,’s legacy without confronting the problem of Jeffrey Tambor, who won an Emmy for playing Maura Pfefferman, the series’ lead character: a well-to-do former UCLA professor who transitions from male to female late in life. (She’s the “trans parent” of the title.) When Tambor was accused of sexual harassment and abusive behavior in 2017 — not long after season 4 debuted — the scandal raised questions about this cutting-edge dramedy’s progressive bona fides.,Tambor doesn’t appear in ,’s final episode, titled “Musicale Finale.” He predicted in 2017 that he’d be dropped from the show, but he didn’t officially resign. Instead, Amazon Studios conducted an official investigation into the allegations, then cut ties with the actor. The finale’s plot easily explains the absence: it’s set in the wake of Maura’s death, and it’s about how the family struggles to move on.,Removing the character who’d been the face of , since it launched in 2014 doesn’t seem that jarring, because the truth of the matter is that Tambor had been a thorny issue for the series for a while… not because of anything he’d done, but because he isn’t transgender himself. Soloway initially defended the decision to cast a cisgender actor as Maura, noting that Tambor’s name and performance (which, for the most part, was brilliant) brought visibility to the project, and gave the show enough clout to fill the cast with trans performers. But the longer the show stuck around — and the more it illuminated the perspectives of trans women — the more off-brand that original choice became., was never wholly about Maura, though. The show was inspired by the experiences Jill and their sister Faith went through when the person they’d known their whole lives as their father suddenly became their mother. So most episodes of the show spent just as much time following the lives of the Pfefferman children. The restless Sarah (Amy Landecker), the clumsily well-meaning Josh (Jay Duplass), and the adventurous, intellectual Ali (Gaby Hoffmann) — who in later seasons identifies as the gender non-binary Ari — are all deeply affected by Maura’s transition. It gives them permission to face up to their own desires and their own pasts.,In the early episodes, Soloway mostly used the show’s premise to capture and satirize the preoccupations of anxious, upper-middle-class Los Angelenos. But by the end of season 1, ,started becoming more ambitious. The flashback episode “Best New Girl” put Maura’s early attempts at understanding the allure of women’s clothes in the context of sexual exploration and the permissive culture of academia. Season 2 went further, developing Soloway’s themes of Jewish suffering and guilt by connecting the Pfeffermans’ story to the gender-bending decadence of pre-Nazi Berlin.,Later seasons were hampered by the kind of repetitiveness that tends to set in with stories about deeply flawed people. Because it would’ve been undramatic for Maura, Shelly, Sarah, Josh, and Ari to fix themselves, , fell into predictable narrative patterns, where the Pfeffermans would have some breakthrough — reckoning with a buried trauma, embracing an identity, committing to a healthy relationship, et cetera — before their usual neediness and self-doubt would knock them back to square one.,That’s why some fans of mature, sophisticated TV never got on board with ,. Not only could the Pfeffermans be bad company, they also weren’t so different from conventional television characters, continually making the same mistakes.,But for the show’s fervent fans, it remained a must-see from start to finish, because any given episode could be another one-of-a-kind classic. Take season 2’s “Man on the Land,” where Maura attends a women’s music festival and is startled to discover that a vocal subset of feminists refuse to celebrate transgender stories, because they see them as another example of men pulling attention away from women. Some ,sequences were startling and beautiful, as in season 3’s “To Sardines and Back,” which starts with a prologue that shows pieces of the Pfeffernans’ life through a pet turtle’s point of view. ,“Musicale Finale” is very much in the spirit of these memorable standalone ,episodes. It’s overstuffed by default. Soloway doesn’t try to put a pretty bow on every storyline, but nearly all the characters, even the non-Pfeffermans, get some screen time to suggest where they might be headed after the closing credits. The finale also includes some fine examples of the show’s tangled ego-clashes. Shelly feels affronted when her kids chastise her for calling Ari their “sister” instead of their “sibling,” at a time when they’re all supposed to be more focused on their grief than on their self-identities. Meanwhile, Ari gets offended that they don’t have a say about Maura’s wish to be cremated.,Mostly, “Musicale Finale” stands out because of its songs (written by Faith, with Jill’s input). Not all of them are as cringe-inducing as “Your Boundary Is My Trigger.” The episode features some truly lovely numbers, including the opener, “Sepulveda Boulevard,” the lilting recurring song “Father’s House,” and the moving “Your Shoes,” in which the actor Shelly has hired to play Maura in a play about her life sings what she’d always wanted to hear her ex-husband say.,Even more than Maura’s death, Shelly’s play is the finale’s unifying element. It’s what gives Soloway (who directed “Musicale Finale,” and co-wrote it with Faith) the chance to comment on Tambor’s absence from the episode, by reminding the audience that this series was always a work of fiction, drawn from real life, but affected by the contributions of the actors and crew. The play also sets up the central clash between Shelly and her children, who resent the way she seems to have replaced them with versions of themselves she can control.,A lot about the finale feels rushed or ill-considered, right up to the catchy but silly closing number, “Joyocaust,” which suggests Jews need to embrace pleasure to put their history of pain behind them. But the meta aspects of Shelly’s play are a conceptual masterstroke. , shouldn’t just be remembered as the show that introduced millions of TV-watchers to a complex, charismatic transgender heroine. It’s also been a show about who gets frame stories, and how. Seen one way, Maura’s journey of self-discovery is inspiring and empowering. Seen another way, her being true to herself has come at the expense of some of her loved ones, and has become a retroactive excuse for lying and infidelity.,The ,finale isn’t wholly about mourning Maura. It’s more about how the culture at large will continue to argue about what we owe to each other and what we owe to ourselves, and whether the two can be reconciled. And it’s a debate worth having, so long as the people involved are honest and open, and can understand that one person’s boundary is another’s trigger."

So it might make more sense to compare Apple’s creative budget to Netflix’s. While Netflix is currently , on its own original series and films this year — more than 300 originals shot around the world — it took six years to get to that level of spending.

Batman casts a heavy shadow over The CW’s new Batwoman series,"
          Oct  2, 2019,  3:06pm EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,", the latest entry in The CW’s Arrowverse slate of TV shows based on DC Comics, is set in a version of Gotham City where Batman has been missing for three years. To combat the crime and despair that’s spread through her town, Bruce Wayne’s cousin Kate Kane (Ruby Rose of ,and ,) borrows his equipment and mantle and takes to the streets.,In the first two episodes of ,, which premieres on Sunday, October 6th, most of Gotham just believes Batman has finally returned. Kate hasn’t established her own superhero identity yet. And neither has her show, which feels stitched together from Batman canon, Batwoman’s comics, and elements of other gritty comic book shows.,Kate has her own obligatory tragic backstory, featuring a car accident caused by one of the Joker’s plots. Batman bought enough time for Kate to escape, but the car fell off a bridge with her mother and twin sister, Beth, still in it. Her father Jacob Kane (Dougray Scott of ,) found a mission in Batman’s failure and created the Crows, a private security firm staffed by elite veterans. The ,pilot shows Kate undergoing intense training to join the family business. Then she’s called to help save her former girlfriend and Crow member Sophie Moore (Meagan Tandy) from Alice (Rachel Skarsten), a murderer and terrorist with a penchant for quoting Lewis Carroll, but no relation to Batman’s own ,-themed villain, the Mad Hatter. Alice is Batwoman’s primary enemy in the comics, and two episodes in, the show is already setting up a dynamic akin to Batman and the Joker, where the two define each other and push each other to extreme action.,The problem is that this, like so much of ,, is familiar material. The show’s tough, brooding protagonist makes it feel similar to ,, and it’s clearly meant to be an , replacement, since that show is launching its eighth and final season on October 15th. But while , kicked off with a bizarre mix of elements from ,,,,,and ,, the beginning of ,feels like a much more straightforward mix of street-level heroics and soap-opera family drama.,also had the advantage of riding the leading wave of modern superhero TV shows, which let it escape much comparison with other entrants in a crowded field. ,instead faces comparisons with the much higher production values of Netflix’s Marvel Cinematic Universe shows. In the DC Extended Universe, ,has distinguished itself with its higher power level and overtly political plotlines, while ,and ,lean into superhero silliness. But the grittiness of , puts the show more in line with Netflix’s ,or ,.,While Netflix’s shows were narratively inconsistent, they delivered phenomenal performances accompanied by gorgeous sets and genre-defining fight scenes that The CW’s budget simply can’t support.,While the actors may settle into a better dynamic later in this opening season, most of the performances in the first two episodes feel stiff. Skarsten’s performance is the highlight of the show so far, swiftly alternating between whimsical dialogue and vicious threats. But other characters are dealing with the heavy burden of getting enough exposition out of the way to set up a supporting ensemble for Batwoman, in the style of all the other CW shows. That cast includes Kate’s med-student stepsister Mary Hamilton (Nicole Kang) and Luke Fox (Camrus Johnson), son of the Wayne Enterprises researcher played by Morgan Freeman in the Christopher Nolan films. When Kate finds the shockingly obvious secret entrance to the Batcave in Bruce Wayne’s office, Luke agrees to rework one of Batman’s suits to fit her, and teaches her about the hero’s array of useful gadgets. It’s infuriating that so far, Kate still hasn’t asked him how he learned Bruce’s secret, what happened to her cousin, or any questions that don’t suit her immediate needs.,’s writers,have followed in the footsteps of the first seasons of ,and ,by giving their title character an unavailable love interest. Kate and Sophie met while attending a military academy that banned gay relationships. Their romance got Kate expelled, and Sophie renounced her to stay enrolled, eventually graduating and marrying a man. It’s a powerful reminder that while significant progress has been made in LGBT equality, discrimination based on sexual orientation is still legal within many US institutions.,That conflict also has a lot more depth than the ones in ,and , where the heroes pretty much had to wait for their romantic rivals to die so they could make their moves. As Mary puts it during a beautifully awkward family breakfast, “Can we talk about the fact that [Sophie’s] married to a man? I’m not trying to label her or anything, but what’s her deal, exactly?” Sophie doesn’t seem particularly happily married, but the question remains whether she’s bisexual, or has suppressed her sexual identity to help her career. Considering the powerful on-screen chemistry she’s shown with Kate, hopefully it won’t take a full season and a dramatic death for them to figure it out.,For a show about an openly gay woman, ,is otherwise surprisingly conservative in its politics. While most of the Arrowverse shows are produced in Vancouver, , shot some of its exterior scenes in Chicago, the same city where ,was filmed. Chicago’s high rates of gun violence have made it a punching bag for Republicans arguing ,, and this version of Gotham carries through the theme by making the city into a nightmare of urban decay. It’s particularly jarring seeing shots of the city’s landmark areas, which are typically populated by international tourists, instead covered with trash and homeless encampments.,The conservative messaging goes beyond the visual cues. While Kate decided to become Batwoman instead of joining the Crows, viewers are still meant to sympathize with Jacob and Sophie as they operate a paramilitary organization within a major American city. Gotham’s police want to lock Alice up in Arkham Asylum, even as she questions Kate’s sanity, in an homage to the “Who’s crazier?” question at the heart of many Batman and Joker plots. Given the controversy around the release of ,and mental illness repeatedly being used as a political scapegoat for mass shootings, it’s unfortunate that , couldn’t take a more nuanced, original approach to the issue.,Rose’s version of Batwoman,first appeared on-screen in 2018 in the Elseworlds Arrowverse crossover event, and the first few episodes of , actually take place before that plot, to establish how she became Gotham’s protector. Two episodes in, she has yet to don the distinctive bright red wig she wore in that event, the one that makes it clear she’s a different Caped Crusader from the one who’s built such a huge fandom. Presumably, the wig will eventually be a plot point showing she isn’t satisfied with living off her cousin’s powerful reputation, and that she intends to forge her own path. Hopefully by then, ,’s writers will be on track to do the same thing."

Amazon’s terrific fantasy Carnival Row works best when it isn’t copying Game of Thrones,"

        ",Samantha Nelson,"Since ,ended in May, HBO’s streaming rivals have been racing to capture their share of the viewers who still crave shows packed with fantasy spectacle, intrigue, and sex. Amazon seems especially focused on winning over genre fans: its Prime Video service is currently spinning up an epic-fantasy lineup that promises , and ,. It’s starting its run with the original show ,, which,will release its first eight-episode season on August 30th. It’s a gorgeous, well-written, and unrepentantly political series, but it’s at its absolute worst when the writers try too hard to make it feel like ,.,is set in a world that resembles what the 1800s might have looked like if the great European powers established colonies and fought proxy wars in the realms of the fae rather than in India or Africa. Six years before the series starts, British Empire stand-in The Burge retreated from the fae nation of Tirnanoc, leaving it in control of The Pact, a group inspired by the World War I ,. The defeat caused a refugee crisis, with desperate fae fleeing to The Burge where they’re largely resigned to a life of menial labor and discrimination.,The story primarily follows Burge investigator Rycroft Philostrate (Orlando Bloom of ,and , franchises) and fresh-off-the-boat faerie Vignette Stonemoss (Cara Delevingne of ,). The two met and fell in love during the war, bonding by sharing a copy of Philo’s favorite scientific-romance novel, and both were left deeply damaged by their parting. A romance novel also sparks an impossible relationship between two soldiers in Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples’ ,comic book series, but while the concept isn’t original, Bloom and Delevingne’s powerful performances bring life to the haunted, soulful Philo and fierce but brittle Vignette.,During their courtship, Vignette and Philo discuss the transcendent power of stories in a way that’s reminiscent of Tyrion’s awful electioneering monologue in the ,But the metatext feels earned here because of the nuanced work series creators René Echevarria (,) and Travis Beacham (the writer of the original script , is based on) are doing to explore empathy and discrimination. ,avoids simplistic narratives where the persecuted fae are good, racists are bad, and the best path for everyone is liberal inclusivity. Instead, they delve into the systemic problems that trap people in bad circumstances and the intense difficulty of enacting change.,The racial narrative weaves throughout the show as Philo investigates a series of murders of fae that his superiors would rather just ignore. Burge Chancellor Absalom Breakspear (Jared Harris of ,and ,) argues that his country must accept refugees because they’re culpable in creating the fae’s plight. But even he uses the show’s colorful collection of racial slurs and seems to have a hard time telling his fae bodyguards apart. Other politicians use the same rhetoric as Donald Trump or Boris Johnson to argue that the new arrivals are taking jobs from citizens and changing the character of the country. The Burge is largely dominated by Caucasians, but it has some people of color in its elite ranks; at one point, Parliament member Sophie Longerbane (Caroline Ford) invokes her own dark complexion and asks whether discrimination against the fae will eventually be seen as the same as that against other humans. In a twist, she concludes that it won’t because the fae “are nothing like us” and deserve their second-class status.,also doesn’t simplify its setting by making discrimination against the fae the world’s only social problem. Women still have little power in this world, and homosexuality is a crime. While the fae are mostly used as a metaphor for refugees and racial discrimination, there’s also an undertone of queerness led by the casting of Delevingne, who is bisexual and genderfluid, playing a bisexual faerie. That subtext is brought home by a subplot involving a gay doctor who secretly performs abortions and operations to help the half-blood children of humans and fae pass as human.,But the best version of ,’s exploration of discrimination involves a plot that effectively combines ,and ,. When socialite Imogen Spurnrose (Tamzin Merchant) learns that the biggest house in town has been purchased, she plots to catch the new owner’s eye. When the buyer turns out to be a fae named Agreus (David Gyasi), she hatches a Jane Austen-esque plot to save her family from financial ruin by having him pay her to ingratiate him into The Burge’s high society. ,That’s a particularly difficult task since Agreus is equally blunt with bigots who view his arrival with disgust and with condescending liberals who want to hear about the homeland he was happy to leave behind. He’s a toughened pragmatist who’s made his fortune in part by helping humans oppress his own people, and he has little patience or sympathy for fae who are trapped in worse circumstances. His plot has almost nothing to do with the main storyline, but the dynamic between him and Imogen, who grows from one of the show’s most hateful characters to one of its strongest, is so compelling that their scenes stand out even as the rest of the show descends into murder, magic, and mayhem.,It’s also one of the few plots that comes to a satisfying conclusion by the end of season 1. While Philo’s intrigue-heavy investigation starts strong and involves some genuinely surprising twists, it fails to stick the landing as it ends up tangled in the show’s mediocre political drama. Both Sophie and Absalom’s wife, Piety (Indira Varma of , and ,), are meant to be masters of manipulation, but they just come across as pale imitations of Littlefinger and Cersei Lannister, respectively. Their schemes involve a battle for control over Piety and Absalom’s slacker son Jonah (Arty Froushan) who is easily the show’s blandest character. Both he and Sophie are thrust into increased prominence in the season finale, which could make them an even bigger drag on the show’s already-announced second season.,But even when the story lags, the visuals never do. Shot in the Czech Republic, the show is filled with wonder-inspiring setpieces like chase scenes along the roofs of The Burge, battles between men and mythical creatures in the snowy mountains of Tirnanoc, and assaults by the scythe-like zeppelins of The Pact. The costumes and makeup are stunning, giving depth to the portrayals of the fae with touches like different styles of horns and the scarification that marks faerie priestesses and mystics.,There’s plenty of sex in ,often made more spectacular through glowing wings faeries can use to take their intimacy to new heights, but there’s none of ,. Instead, ,s writers trust viewers to keep up with their world-building, regularly dropping terms like “Haruspex” and “mimasery” with almost no explanation beyond the immediate context. That tactic avoids clunky exposition that can bog down genre works, and it also makes the world feel mysterious and largely unexplored, even after eight episodes. It’s a clever technique that could keep viewers engrossed in ,’s mysteries for seasons to come and hopefully give the writers the freedom to continue forging their original identity."

We can do it!” ,When we got the green light, that was when Javi came in, because we had never been in a writers’ room, much less run one. It was a very collaborative experience. ,We say working on a Jim Henson product is a team sport. With this one more than anything else, the theme of the entire show is unity. The Jim Henson ethos is very collaborative. It involves a lot of different artists in all disciplines, including writing. ,Everything about this project was really informed by this idea that we were all collaborators working on something bigger than all of us. The trope that was circulated was that this was a garden that had been tended for 37 years, and we were coming in to take care of it for a little while. We could decide where to put plants, but it was part of our job to keep the legacy intact and do new honor to that legacy.,Don’t mess up the garden because, hopefully, we get to pass it on to somebody else. We had all the space we wanted — there was never a mandate of “You can’t.” We created whole characters, leads, and arcs. We were given a lot of space. ,To give you a concrete example, we went in and we looked at the head sculpt for the Scientist puppet, and they sculpted him with two eyes. We were like, “Well, in the movie, he’s got a mechanical eye.” And they were like, “We know, but we have to sculpt them in full, and then we will take out the eye and put in the mechanical eye because that’s a separate prop.” And then we said, “Well, we need to tell a story about the Chamberlain’s duplicity and his ability to maneuver events in his favor. Let’s have the Scientist with two eyes at the beginning, and show how he only got one eye.” And then that helped us with our storytelling. , Netflix was developing an animated prequel series. And we came on only after Netflix called up Lisa and said, “Let’s do it with puppets.” She was like, “Are you sure? Do you know how hard that is?” It’s a testament to Netflix that they took this crazy leap of faith and did the show properly. It should be done with puppets. It should be live-action. It should feel tangible. It’s a built, created world. ,It was just luck that when we called up, they were at a new beginning, and we’re like, “Okay, great. Here’s how you do that.” And it all came together.,I think that the animated show was skewing a little younger, a little more magical. We were a little bit more grounded in this world. We felt like this was a much more tangible, dirty world. We spent a lot of time literally dirtying up the puppets.,We looked at this as a 10-hour drama. We never looked at it as “a puppet show.” We came into this with the intention of making, and ,, something that could compete with those properties. And the thing that informed everything we did was that we needed to have characters with rich inner lives and a world with real stakes. ,Yes, and there were times because production was so fast that I would literally just [have the puppeteers mouth] about eight to 10 syllables, and then I could go back later and write the line. I did that very rarely, but sometimes it did happen, and we could create those moments in post as well. , We had Eddie Izzard. It’s one of his great skills. It’s tricky because we have so many rules in terms of words. Like, we try not to assign genders to the Skeksis. It’s very controlled and scripted. But within that, if the performer has an idea, and we can make it match to the mouth-flaps, we’ll come up with a new line. , Eddie Izzard got “bugger” in. , It was really funny, and it made us laugh, so there we go. Everybody’s building off of each other. And the voice actors got very protective of their puppeteers. Like Taron [Egerton] would be like, “No, no, Neil [Sterenberg] is mine.” They form a connection. It’s a synthesis. All of the puppeteers have voices in the show as well, so they’re all over the place. ,On average, I think we were like 200 people because we also had our shops in the warehouse as well. We took over a warehouse space with 89 sets, which was about the size of two football fields. We also had a creature shop in there. So there are a lot of people, even separate from the design and art department, a lot of people in the building separate from what’s on set, if that makes sense. And then our largest days, I think we had 100 puppeteers on set, which is crazy. Some of them are doing radio control or second unit, things like that. Sometimes we had puppeteers just holding two puppets in the air as background because, like, “We need bodies on-screen.” I think if you’d ever picked up a puppet and lived in England, at some point, you wound up working on ,. It was big. ,An amazing thing about puppeteers that I don’t think everyone understands is that they can play the lead on a character, a big part on a lead character, and then in the next shot, they’re someone else’s left hand. They really are a troupe. There’s a lack of ego. They move from one character to the other. It’s really encouraging about humanity. , It really feels like the idea of an old-school theater troupe, where one moment, you’re the lead, and the next moment, you’re handing somebody a cup. That’s how they treat it. It’s really cool.,Usually three. You’ve got the main puppeteer who’s doing the mouth and one arm, then they’ve got an assist doing the other arm, and then there’s somebody doing radio control of the eye blinks, and things like that. Unless you’re Alice [Dinnean], who did Brea. Alice had a separate performance system where she was controlling a lot of that herself, with a literal Wii nunchuck they converted. So she would often only have herself and an assist because she was in control of a lot of those facial movements. ,It’s one of the reasons Brea is so good at eyerolls. ,Yeah, because that’s Alice, doing every part of that performance along with her assist doing the other hand, all simultaneously.,One of the most fun things about doing this job was every Friday, we had a meeting at the creature shop. And we were watching the people there innovate new ways of doing puppetry. So for example, one day we got there, and the 3D printers were just chugging away. Obviously, 3D printing has been a boon to this kind of storytelling. But they were building a system that was custom-designed to the puppeteers’ hands, with individual controllers per finger, so the puppeteer would have complete fidelity from his or her hand movements to the hand at the end of the rod. ,I was also there the day they first tested the AI system with the Wii nunchuck controller. We got to see, in real time, how they were taking this art of puppetry that they’ve done for so long, and in meeting the challenges of the show, creating new technologies to do the things the creature shop has been doing for 50 years. One of the most interesting things was seeing how much 3D printing figures into it now and how much that helps build custom pieces for puppets, custom pieces for everything. That process has been game-changing.,I remember one day at the shop, one of the designers very gently handed me the Emperor’s scepter. He said, “Be careful. This is the original from the film.” And then he accidentally drops it, and I started screaming. And then he was like, “Oh no, I just 3D-printed it. It’s just a perfect match.” [,.],Even though the Jim Henson Company is not exactly lax about archiving — they are the caretakers of the legacy of one of the most venerated creators in popular culture — there are certain things where they had to make guesses. One day, I went to the creature shop, and there was a guy airbrushing Aughra’s skin. He had a magazine that was printed in 1982 when the movie came out, he had stills from the movie, and some of the books that came out when the movie came out. Because nobody could quite figure out what Aughra’s actual color was. She looks different in different shots because of how she’s lit, the way any actor would look different. So sometimes you’re seeing an exact duplicate of what was on-screen 37 years ago, and some things on-screen are educated guesses. ,It wasn’t about limitations. It was about collaboration. Louis had a pretty good idea of how he was going to shoot it. ,It was very impressive storyboarding. I remember a lot of versions of storyboards.,But there’s nothing that I would say that we ever pitched, that anybody ever said, “We can’t do that with puppets, it’s too far.” Which is crazy. ,I mean, everyone’s trying to push the envelope all the time. And so everyone is the best at what they do. And everyone is trying to find a solution. So it was really very free.,An action sequence is no different from a musical number. In a stage musical, it’s what happens when dialogue no longer serves a dramatic purpose. So you always have a true north, whenever you’re staging this kind of stuff, in what is telling the story, what is driving home the emotional stakes. So there are a bunch of sequences where maybe you’re not seeing what we came up with in the room — not because the puppets couldn’t do it, but because there wasn’t enough time or money or what have you. But everything that’s in the show is there to serve the emotional reality of the world and the characters. And whether you’re doing drama or puppets, action sequences are hard to choreograph, technologically difficult. But you always have your true north of what in it is serving the character and the story. ,We treated the puppets the way you would actors in a movie. There’s a big talking point in , coverage about, “Oh, they didn’t use CGI?” Well of course we did. We’re building a world. It’s a huge VFX project. But the puppets are the main event, the puppets are the actors.,The biggest lesson I think we can all learn from CGI in filmmaking is that we need to be selective about what we choose to show on-screen. Because ultimately, one of the drawbacks of being able to do anything and everything is that you get too much. You don’t get enough of the gaps in the storytelling that engage your mind in it. There’s a reason , won the Oscar for Best Editing. It’s because their technology was limited enough that they had to make very strong choices about how the film being put together served that story. And with us doing this, even though we have access to all of this puppetry, even though we have access to CGI technology as well, we needed to look at all this and figure out, when the rubber meets the road, how do we make scenes so they’re only serving story?,That’s a very high-minded answer. I’ll tell you, one of the most fun things is throwing puppets off of things. We just had the best time. So if you watch the show, if you notice in the back half, puppets start getting chucked around more because we just liked it. Just throwing those things was the best. ,They did so much puppet-throwing that it’s going to be an Olympic event.,We got really good at it. , A lot of people are going to see this and assume we did a bunch of things with CGI. And the truth of the matter is that a lot of the time, we didn’t. You are looking at really old-fashioned technologies that are working in concert with CGI. I mean, so much of this of this product is handmade. I think it’ll be interesting to find out what people thought was what and how frequently they’re right or wrong.,Jim Henson wasn’t exactly a Luddite. If you look at, for example, ,, they spent a lot of time and money figuring out how to make Kermit ride a bicycle in the prologue, and then that technology got applied to all of the movies that came afterward. Puppetry isn’t a static art. It’s an art that depends on technology. The technology keeps feeding the craft., That said, there’s nothing better than a couple of Podlings yelling at each other.,Because they are the most puppety. There’s variations of like how puppety you can get with it. Yeah, the Gelflings are more “human.” They have a little bit more weight. But a Podling can run in, scream, fall down, jump up, be drunk, and run out the door, and you’re having a great time. A Gelfling doing that doesn’t feel right; a Skeksis doing that doesn’t feel right. So Podlings are really fun and freeing because they’re just physical comedy.,You haven’t lived until you’ve had Lisa Henson say, “You shouldn’t put that in the script.” “Why not?” “It might be too puppety.” “I guess you’d know!”, I think Netflix does, and I think other people do. We just tried to write the story that felt right to us. We were thinking about younger audiences. We weren’t consciously trying to go to “dark places.” That is part of the show because it’s part of the legacy. There were times when we would have long talks about the violence, but it wasn’t from a perspective of trying to hit an age. It was trying to say, “What’s the point of the violence? What are the repercussions of the violence? And how is it part of this story?”,Yeah, we have a written document that plans out season 2. Everybody’s very excited about it. And now we just wait to see what the numbers are and wait for that phone call that we get to go back to Thra. , If you watch it, we will write it. , I think it would be more efficient, but I would try to use the time to make the show even bigger and crazier. , We know a little bit about what you can do with puppets and what the edge is. But we’re ready to move it to the next level after that.  , Olympic-level puppet-throwing. , Oh my god. It’s so fun to throw puppets."
Netflix’s Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance builds on everything that made the film great,"
          Aug 30, 2019, 10:54am EDT
        ",Samantha Nelson,"In 1982, Jim Henson and Frank Oz redefined fantasy filmmaking with ,, an ambitious, puppet-driven movie that tells a wondrous story about an ancient world on the brink of destruction or salvation. In the post-, fantasy licensing frenzy, it would have been easy for Netflix to snap up the rights to the ,world, make a cheap knockoff, and count on nostalgia to lure viewers. Instead, ,and ,director Louis Leterrier has produced a true labor of love. The series , builds on everything that made the film great, and it has the potential to become a classic in its own right.,set on the dying world of Thra, followed two Gelflings — the last survivors of a small, elfin race — on a quest to restore a crystal power source that was corrupted by a malevolent birdlike race known as the Skeksis. ,, which releases its 10-episode first season on August 30th,,is set before those events. The Gelflings are a thriving society of disparate clans loyal to the Skeksis, but are stirred to action when they learn that the Lords of the Crystal are killing Gelflings to extend their own lives. ,While the show uses much of the world-building and some of the plot points from , the show has its own protagonists and structure. The story beats will still feel familiar, given how closely they follow the ,formula. To defeat a terrible evil, reluctant heroes must put aside their differences and band together, find unlikely allies, gather lost lore and weapons, and overcome betrayal. The similarities are particularly strong given that the Gelflings’ short stature and love of music makes them feel distinctly hobbit-like.,The heroes seem unfortunately bland because of the fidelity Jim Henson’s Creature Shop paid to the original puppets and their largely unexpressive faces. While the designers strove to distinguish them with a wide variety of complexions, clothing, and hairstyles befitting their clans and status, the characters feel indistinct in the early episodes. The Skeksis General skekUng (Benedict Wong of ,) lampshades the issue by complaining that he can’t tell the show’s three Gelfling princesses apart. ,While most of the characters eventually come into their own, the Gelfling warrior Rian (voiced by Taron Egerton of ,and the Kingsman series) never really gains any defining personality traits besides being brave and good with a sword. His genericness makes the moments when he’s supposed to be inspiring his people fall flat. Far more nuanced are the scholarly princess Brea (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Deet (Nathalie Emmanuel of ,), who leaves her underground home at a tree’s behest to spread word of a pending ecological disaster.,Still, the first season’s best hero isn’t a Gelfling, but a Podling, a member of an even more diminutive race that the Skeksis use as servants. The aspiring Podling paladin Hup (Victor Yerrid) is only barely capable of communicating with his traveling companions, but he gets by with a heavy dose of expressive charm and by blowing loud raspberries whenever he’s displeased.,Any distinctive qualities the heroes lack is more than made up for by the show’s villains. Leterrier has assembled an incredible cast to play the Skeksis, who alternate between hatching monstrous schemes, bickering with each other, and luxuriating in the pleasures their rule has bought them. Simon Pegg voices the manipulative skekSil the Chamberlain so well that his portrayal is practically indistinguishable from Barry Dennen’s version in the original film. That’s no small feat, considering how much of the character is built on distinctive vocal tics and a sing-song tone that manages to be both comical and ominous. ,Mark Hamill’s voice for sketTek the Scientist is just a few steps removed from the one he’s used for various iterations of Batman’s nemesis the Joker. (The similarity is particularly clear in sketTek’s frequent bursts of maniacal laughter.) Andy Samberg absolutely steals an entire episode as a Skeksis heretic who shares the secret history of the world with the Gelflings through a mix of opera and puppetry, and Jason Isaacs brings the dark gravitas he showed as Lucius Malfoy in the ,films,to the Emperor skekSo. The writers spend plenty of time showing how a profound fear of death leads the Skeksis to commit an escalating series of horrors, and not a moment of that time feels dull or wasted.,The original,film has stood the test of time so well thanks to its puppets and practical effects, which still look distinctive and well-crafted more than 30 years later. ,is committed to maintaining that legacy by minimizing CGI in favor of puppets and animatronics. The detail is absolutely incredible, from the grotesque Skeksis to the menagerie of strange critters that make Thra feel as fully realized as Pandora from ,.,Every episode brings some new visual wonder, like a giant manta-ray-esque creature ridden by a desert-dwelling tribe of Gelflings, a swarm of giant arachnids that assemble themselves into a mouth to speak to the Skeksis, or the carriages the Skeksis ride around Thra, which are controlled by giant pill bugs rolled into wheels.,The constant cavalcade of cute animals and goofy characters is sure to delight kids, but parents eager to share their fond memories of ,should be prepared for just how dark ,gets. Like any epic fantasy, it’s filled with noble sacrifices and tragic deaths, and the writers don’t pull any punches when it comes to showing the Skeksis brutally torturing and murdering characters. The show is in many ways tonally similar to the 1984 fantasy film ,, and it’s likely to traumatize as many children as it delights.,The film established a world that was strange and mysterious, but it barely skimmed the surface of its potential in its 90-minute runtime. The ,writers are filling that blank space in a way that feels natural rather than superfluous. They’ve invented past conflicts, expanded the roles of characters from the film, and built a nuanced social order for the Gelflings that helps explain how the Skeksis came to power and maintained their grasp on Thra for a thousand years. The writers have also created numerous minor touches that add to the character of the world, like beautiful, somber rituals for the choosing of a new Gelfling leader, and a way of mourning that still embraces the show’s central philosophy that death is a necessary, important part of life.,One of the most remarkable feats of building on the source material comes from the show’s use of dreamfasting, a Gelfling ability to share memories through touch. In ,, it was used to quickly share backstories in a visual way, and to build fast intimacy. , expands considerably on the idea, exploring the ways dreamfasting would affect society, from letting couples relive their favorite moments together to a leap of faith that allows strangers to move past possible social deceptions. So much thought went into the ability that the writers even had the Chamberlain show his cleverness by coming up with a way to undermine the power.,All this world-building has the potential to feel terribly depressing for film viewers who already know the fate in store for the Gelfling people. But one of the series’ many clever twists makes it clear that ,isn’t a typical prequel, and that the writers aren’t entirely bound by the film’s events. It’s just another sign that the series’ creators understand why viewers would want to return to Thra and know just how to keep them there. Given that the season ends with multiple cliffhangers, it’s clear that the creators hope to continue the show with that knowledge in mind, further developing the characters and the film’s wondrous world."
Netflix’s new Dark Crystal reboot reaches back to the gentle fantasy of Fraggle Rock,"
          Aug 30, 2019, 11:20am EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,“The Gorg Who Would Be King,” a 1987 episode of the HBO children’s series ,, and one of the last installments of the show’s original five-season run. The story follows Junior, the prince of his giant-sized race, as he shrinks down to the size of a Fraggle, and gets a lesson from the much smaller species about what it means to be part of a community. Credited to screenwriter Laura Phillips and director Terry Maskell, “The Gorg Who Would Be King” delivers a clear moral message aimed at an elementary-school audience. It’s also a meaningful exploration of ,’s interconnected ecosystem, where Gorgs, Fraggles, and the tiny worker-creatures the Doozers live symbiotically.,Because Netflix is debuting , this weekend.,A prequel to Jim Henson’s 1982 fantasy film ,, the new 10-episode series tells the story of how the planet Thra’s troubles began when a species known as the Skeksis began controlling the world’s mystical forces at the expense of the more peaceful, elfin Gelflings. With a mix of puppetry and CGI — and with an all-star voice cast that includes Mark Hamill, Anya Taylor-Joy, Eddie Izzard, Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, and Simon Pegg — the show offers a richly imagined fantasy universe, as the backdrop to a story with real sociopolitical resonance.,This new , series could restore the reputation of one of Henson’s more troubled projects. A restless artist and a shrewd businessman, Henson figured out as a teenager how to monetize his puppetry, selling his services to local TV stations and advertisers as early as the mid-1950s. By the late 1960s, he was a regular on national network broadcasts, and he leveraged his fame to pitch more ambitious but potentially unwieldy ideas, including the kind of elaborate fantasy epics that would evolve into ,.,The chorus of “no”s Henson heard in response to his more serious pitches partly inspired ,, a hit variety series about underdog entertainers with big dreams. The success of , and , reopened some of the doors that had been closed to Henson. But when he poured a lot of his new clout into ,, the movie was greeted with tepid reviews and merely respectable box office. It found a fervent cult audience, but it wasn’t the blockbuster smash and franchise-starter Henson had hoped for.,Henson found other outlets for his high-fantasy obsessions. In 1983, he and his team launched ,, an expensive international co-production, and one of the first prominent examples of a non-broadcast network (HBO in the US) buying original programming from top talent. Though aimed at kids, the series also appealed to older Henson fans. In ,’s attractively designed and well-thought-out universe, the fun-loving title characters and their Doozer helpers live in a network of caves, nestled between the kingdom of the enormous, galumphing Gorgs and the workshop of a human tinkerer named Doc (and his super cute dog, Sprocket, an astonishingly realistic Muppet creation).,The typical , episode is like a lighter version of ,, with low-stakes quest plots that map out these characters’ delicately balanced culture. In “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” Junior learns that, according to tradition, he’s supposed to become the new ruler when the last leaf falls from the Nirvana tree. He decides to shirk his duty by eating the leaf, but he immediately shrinks. Junior is taken in by the Fraggles — considered little more than garden pests by Gorgs — and his new friends teach him about their way of life where no one’s the boss and instead everyone moderates their friends’ behavior by cracking gentle jokes at their expense whenever they mess up.,Parents of small children and fans of DIY fantasy.,Unlike the all-ages ,, , was aimed at kids just slightly older than a , audience but not old enough for ,. Like nearly all Henson productions, the show features such well-developed characters and nifty-looking puppets (with floppy feather-duster hair) that adults who appreciate fine craftsmanship won’t mind watching along with their youngsters. In “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” Laura Phillips even throws in a Rolling Stones reference when the sentient trash heap Marjory tells Junior, “You can’t always get what you want… but you just might find you get what you need.”,Each episode featured multiple catchy songs; in “The Gorg Who Would Be King,” it’s the snappy anarchist anthem, “You Can Never Be the Boss of Someone Else.” The thoughtfulness of , remains impressive. In this episode, when Pa chastises Junior about his ambivalence toward becoming king, he snaps, “You don’t have to understand the universe; you just have to rule it!” That’s a funny line, in large part because it runs so counter to the Henson studio’s central philosophy. Henson felt the way to make great art — and to live a life of value — was to pay attention to the tiniest details. Everything matters because everything works in harmony.,HBO Go and HBO Now. , is available on Netflix."
The new science fiction series from Cowboy Bebop’s director isn’t that far off from reality,"
          Aug 30, 2019,  2:40pm EDT
        ",D. M. Moore,"The first episode of , — the new anime series, and , director Shinichirō Watanabe — hits Netflix on August 30th. The series is set on Mars, 50 years after humans started living there, in a New York City-like metropolis called Alba City. It’s a futuristic world, but a familiar one as well. Watanabe pulls off an impressive trick here by presenting a world that’s just a little off familiar tech levels, just far enough to seem impressive, without reaching too far into science fiction.,The series follows the titular Tuesday, the daughter of a rich, powerful political family, as she runs away from home and heads to the big city to pursue her dream of being a musician. She’s taken in by Carole, also a young aspiring musician, who makes a living jumping from one short stint at a part-time job to another. The two instantly hit it off and start writing songs together, which is a uniquely strange thing on this futuristic Mars, as no one makes music without at least some help from artificial intelligence.,While the show’s Mars setting allows it to imagine some amazing fictional technology, a lot of what’s on display actually exists in some form today. Here’s a look at how close some of ,’s science-fiction tech is to reality., reporter Dani Deahl explored the field of using artificial intelligence to create music in ,. The idea dates back to at least the 1990s, when David Bowie helped develop a piece of software that reordered lyrics into new combinations to help with writing. More recently, AIs are being designed to generate the instrumental tracks of songs based on data from existing music. As Dani describes it: ,In , the music-making AIs generally seem to be working in tandem with an artist or producer to create a song — except in the case of Tao and Angela, whose story in the show runs parallel to Carole and Tuesday’s. Tao is a wildly successful music producer who builds incredibly advanced AIs to create every aspect of a song, including vocal performances. Tao hires Angela to be the first human he actually makes songs for. The first part of the series reveals that Tao’s programs make songs for her not just based on her vocal range, but on the words she uses and how she behaves. That’s certainly far more advanced than any AI that exists today, but then, it seems pretty advanced for the series’ technology, too.,One of the first pieces of future gadgetry we see (and covet) in the series is Tuesday’s smart luggage. It’s self-propelled, driving itself around to follow her wherever she goes, and is even equipped with little robotic legs to use when it encounters stairs. When it’s stolen, it manages to not get broken into, then finds its way back to Tuesday on its own, indicating that it has some sort of sophisticated tracking system.,A few years ago, smart luggage seemed to be having a moment, with lots of little companies springing up with their own takes on similar gadgets. They ranged from luggage with built-in batteries for recharging your phone to ones a bit more like Tuesday’s that could , to follow their owner around. Some could , through the use of a sophisticated theoretical mesh network of other smart luggage.,But then , any smart luggage that didn’t have removable batteries, and , that complied with the new rule from being loaded on to planes. Which in turn led to a number of , closing. Surprisingly, though, the only really futuristic thing about Tuesday’s luggage is the legs.,Carole’s favorite mode of transport around Alba City is an electric one-wheeled skateboard. While there have been a number of attempts at making , , , over the last few years, Carole’s seems closest in design to ,. Unlike the Pint, though, the fictional version has a hubless motor design for its wheel, and folds up for easy transport when not in use. It is also seems incredibly light, given how Carole is able to carry it one-handed and get pretty significant air clearance off the ground with it.  ,AI seems to be a blanket term in the series, encompassing all sorts of intelligent robots and software that vary greatly in levels of functionality and sentience. Carole has a personable robotic owl AI pet whose main function is as an alarm clock, but it seems to possess some deductive reasoning and problem-solving abilities. There’s also an AI music producer in a robotic dog, which serves as a judge on an ,/ , type music-competition show. The dog also has a distinct personality, and makes jokes like a human judge on a reality competition show. It’s difficult to tell, though, how much of this behavior is sentience, and how much is fakery though programming.,Current actual robotic pets are far less sophisticated than their anime counterparts, at least in terms of range of movement and functionality. Many are less animal-like than Carole’s owl, like the odd-looking toddler robot ,, or the more abstract ,. Neither is as close to the show’s example as ,, though, and that seems to be the design inspiration for the reality show judge’s robotic body.,Aibo is a $1,800 robot dog covered in sensors, which allow it to respond to voice commands and petting. It can use a camera in its nose to recognize people, and send security updates on what’s going on at home. But even with all that, it’s more like a slow-moving, stumbly puppy than something that could pass a Turning test.,The first few large-scale professional concerts in the first part of , actually seem pretty conventional by real-world standards, with giant screens acting as musical visualizers, along with laser and pyrotechnics displays, depending on the style of the band playing. That is until Crystal — apparently a sort of future anime Mars version of Beyoncé — performs while accompanied by a crowd-enveloping flock of holographic birds.,Most modern holographic illusions at concerts use an old illusionist’s technique called ,, which essentially bounces light off a film or glass to produce a transparent ghostly image, like with ,, or the real-world concerts for ,. For last year’s ,, augmented reality tech was used to incorporate virtual characters into a live performance, but this effect wasn’t visible to the naked eye for people attending in person.,The closest real-world equivalent to the effect Crystal has is the Holosphere, which was featured in ,. The two-story-tall sphere is wrapped in strips of LED lights, which effectively turns it into a sort of semi-transparent spherical display. It allows performers inside it to appear as if they’re standing in the center of a giant eyeball, ball of lightning, or whatever designs they configure to map to the sphere. While not technically a hologram, the sphere seems as though it could produce a similar illusory effect as Crystal’s birds, although not to the same audience and stage-circling scope.,A number of restaurants and bars in Alba City are equipped with touch-screen tables and bar tops, allowing tables to become both menus for customers to peruse, and waitstaff for taking orders. The one shown in a pizza restaurant is particularly neat, since it blends back into the restaurant’s aesthetic when not in use, by displaying a wood-panel surface. But it’s more intriguing to see what these screens reveal about labor in ,While a lot of the series’ food and drink ordering and preparation is automated, waitstaff and bartenders can still be called on for a more human experience.,In terms of automated food preparation, last year ,’s Nick Statt ,:,Surprisingly, the screen technology on display in the show seems like it might be more fictional than the robotic food prep. For a while, Microsoft tinkered with making ,, but later repurposed the name for its line of tablets and laptops. Then in 2016, a French company created a ,, which seems as though it could be an ancestor of the ones in the show. The fictional version still looks a bit more like a giant TV laid flat than a table, though, even when it’s off. ,Sony showed off a different approach in 2017 at SXSW, with an overhead projector that could effectively turn any flat surface into a touchscreen display. While that couldn’t have been used at the bar in the anime, conceivably an overhead projector-style device could have created the menu on the table at the pizza restaurant, while also allowing for it to be just a normal wooden table.,After watching the first 12 episodes of this 24-episode show — all 12 of which are now on Netflix  —  it occurred to me that the series’ future technology was directly extrapolated from current trends and devices. That helps speak to one of the show’s major themes — criticizing the idea of removing humans from music creation. To explore that idea, Watanabe needed to create a world where humans didn’t make music, AI did. But he also had to make that world feel relatable to the audience.,And that helps explain the show’s aesthetic. It’s why even though Alba City is about 50 years old and on Mars, it looks like a modern Earth metropolis, with some buildings that look like they date back to the early 1900s. It’s why the characters’ cellphones look like modern cellphones, and have Instagram on them. ,Watanabe did a similar thing with his retro designs on ,That show is also set in Earth’s far future, with humans rapidly traveling from planet to planet ,. But the details of the world look familiar from contemporary 1980s and 1990s film and TV. They’re modified and retrofitted to evoke a much more futuristic world, but they aren’t jarring or alienating. , does the same thing. So little of the world is explained outright, but it doesn’t need justifications and setup, because it looks so close to familiar. It’s easy to look into this world and imagine yourself there — and more, when looking at its clean designs and just-forward-of-present devices, actively wanting to be there."
The Boys is a bloody manic mayhem dream show,"
          Jul 24, 2019, 11:05am EDT
        ",Shana O'Neil,"When the screen adaptation of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson’s , comic books premieres on Amazon Prime Video on July 26th, fans will likely notice a lot of changes to the story. But creator and showrunner Eric Kripke (,, ,) has crafted an adaptation that honors the comics while also giving new audiences access to a story that comes at viewers hard and fast., is set in an America where superheroes are heavily commodified and merchandised. They’re brand names. They’re not just saving the world; they’re starring in movies, splashed across billboards for theme parks, endorsing everything from shoes to cereal, and marketed within an inch of their lives.,At the center of their world is Vought International, a multibillion-dollar corporation that employs more than 200 superheroes, managing their schedules, lives, and images. Like any business, Vought is looking to make money, and it will protect its investments at any cost. As ,reveals early, there’s certainly a cost because superheroes are dicks.,Spider-Man’s “With great power comes great responsibility” ideology seems to have completely missed ,’ heroes who don’t take much responsibility for the damage they cause. They catch criminals and save people under Vought’s management, but they consider collateral damage — like, say, obliterating a random bystander on the way to stop bank robbers — as just the cost of doing business. Vought has entire PR and clean-up teams to deal with such situations, so all the outside world sees is the good the supers do.,But cover-ups only go so far, and every once in a while, the façade breaks. In the case of ,, the cracks come in the form of two people: mild-mannered tech salesperson Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) and Starlight, aka Annie January (Erin Moriarty), the newest member of Vought’s premiere superhero squad, The Seven. While their lives couldn’t be more different, Hughie and Annie become the epicenter of a superhero shake-up that could bring Vought down.,Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban). Billy Butcher hates Vought. He hates superheroes. He wants the entire superhero business to burn to the ground, and he’s made it his mission to punish heroes who step out of line. He’s crass, he’s sexist, he’s vulgar, he’s violent, and he lies about pretty much everything. He isn’t looking to save the world. His vendetta is personal. But his goal to take down Vought wins Hughie to his side, which quickly pulls Hughie in over his head.,When I , in December 2018, he told me , is a “hard R, it’s a big difference from anything I’ve done before. But anyone who knows me knows that I have a super filthy sense of humor… I’ve never been able to express it to the public… My parents are gonna be horrified.” That’s certainly possible because he really does shoot for the moon in making , transgressive and boundary-pushing. It’s a gory show, with blood and brains and severed arms and brutal fights.,The adaptation cleaves hard from the source material when it comes to graphic adult material like sex, nudity, assault, and torture. No one is spared in the bloodbath. And yet there’s a relatability to the Boys, from Billy Butcher’s need for revenge on the supers over his wife’s death to Hughie’s similar fight for justice after one of the supers kills his girlfriend by running through her. Other members of the group, including Frenchie, Mother’s Milk, and The Female, have their own reasons for wanting to fight the superheroes or take down Vought itself. Their violent missions feel like a righteous cause taken to the extreme, unlike the supers’ casual brutality.,It would have been easy to turn , into a misogynistic splatterfest, but Kripke navigates around that trap while also dropping in a few elements that add equality to the picture. Sure, Billy Butcher calls the Statue of Liberty a “slit” and throws the word “cunt” around like confetti, but multiple men strip down for the show — including Karl Urban and another character who goes full-frontal — while there’s no corresponding female nudity. The contrast is rare enough to feel refreshing, and the nudity in the script isn’t sexualizing the characters. It feels like a polite nod to the female gaze, rather than anything specifically gratuitous.,More significantly, , grapples directly with the #MeToo era in a plot thread where Starlight is sexually assaulted by one of The Seven as part of her “initiation,” but she finds a way not just to fight back, but to claim her own agency among the group. The men also get their illuminating, human moments. Mother’s Milk is out kicking superhero ass, but he’s also maintaining a strong, loving relationship with his wife, whether it’s taking her calls no matter how inopportune the time, or bringing home lobster for dinner. Like Frenchie’s nurturing, philosophical side and Hughie’s vulnerability, these human details make the characters more rounded and the violence seem more personal.,Kripke does seem to delight in just how meteorically out-there he can get with ,. Aside from the general mayhem caused by superhero powers used without restraint, the psychological side of , gets plumbed with reckless abandon. From a super crushing a man’s skull as she orgasms to another super’s paraphilic infantilism fetish, Kripke uses extreme moments to build the story.,It helps that he’s chosen a cast that grounds so much of ,’ wildness in some sort of understandable reality. Elisabeth Shue is a standout as Vought’s senior VP of hero management, Madelyn Stillwell. A genderbend from the comics’ James Stillwell, Madelyn is an enjoyable subversion of Shue’s likability factor in , or , as a younger woman and more recently on ,. Madelyn is beautiful, charming, supportive, and smart. But her job at Vought is all about branding, and she’s aware that image is everything. Underneath her pearlescent smile, she’s a keen hunter who’s willing to do whatever it takes to secure her power at Vought.,Billy Butcher is a right bastard, but Urban balances a maniacal glee with a wounded determination that keeps him human even when he’s planning to blow people up. Urban may be broadly familiar these days as Dr. Leonard McCoy in the , film reboots, but longtime fans know he can just as easily play villains, like Vaako in ,, or disillusioned good guys like John Kennex in ,, and he’s handled more than his fair share of action.,And Jack Quaid (the son of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan) brings an intriguing mix of insecure intelligence, charm, and unexpressed rage to Hughie Campbell. As the entry point for the series, the character being introduced to a new world of violence, Quaid’s Hughie has to be likable while still being a doormat. Simon Pegg is perfect as Hughie’s dad, offering an idea of how Hughie became those things. On the other side of the spectrum, Antony Starr’s Homelander is vibrating with menace and fanatical belief. Other cast members play their roles in big, forceful ways without going too far over-the-top, which is an impressive feat in a show that’s so close to over-the-top most of the time.,Lucky for ,, it’s in the right hands. Kripke and executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have a knack for pushing right up to the line of outrageousness without going over. Kripke has assembled veteran TV directors like Daniel Attias (,), Philip Sgriccia (,), and Stefan Schwartz (,) alongside newer talents like Jennifer Phang (,) to help bring out the glitz and grime of the original , comics. Like ,, , also takes more than its fair share of shots at Christianity and organized religion, especially with the superhero character of Ezekiel. But the story also delves into Starlight’s faith. Christianity is part of her superhero identity and marketing, and she finds strength in it when everything she thought she knew about superheroes comes crashing down.,Filled with blasphemy, guts, sex, and heartfelt emotion, , is going to alienate some viewers. It’s deliberately pushing boundaries. It’s crass, it’s bloody, it’s brutal, and it’s got a raunchy sense of humor. But it’s a hell of a lot of fun. And for viewers who love a little anarchy and bedlam in their superhero drama, it hits all the right notes. "

Why Netflix’s Derry Girls is the perfect show to stream this weekend,"
          Aug  2, 2019, 10:00am EDT
        ",Noel Murray,"The Verge,The first episode of ,, a sitcom created by Northern Irish playwright Lisa McGee for Britain’s Channel 4. Based loosely on McGee’s experiences growing up in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, in the early 1990s, in the waning years of the sectarian violence familiarly dubbed “the Troubles,” the show acknowledges the era’s mounting tensions while also telling lighthearted, hilariously profane stories about teens being teens. The first episode — titled “Episode One” — introduces the cast of Catholic schoolgirls. Saoirse-Monica Jackson plays Erin, an intensely self-conscious youngster who is stuck rooming with her weirdo cousin Orla (Louisa Harland). The two are pals with the skittish Clare (Nicola Coughlan) and the cocky Michelle (Jamie-Lee O’Donnell). At the start of a new school year, Michelle has been saddled with her own cousin, James (Dylan Llewellyn), an English kid assigned to be the first male to attend the all-girls Our Lady Immaculate College. (The authorities are afraid he’ll be beaten up at a boys’ school.),Because ,’ second season has just been made available in its entirety on Netflix.,Not enough Netflix subscribers know about the delight that is ,, a fast-paced, funny show that packs a lot of snappy dialogue and adolescent antics into each 22-minute installment, mixed with some rich period detail. In the second of the series’s six-episode seasons, the kids from Our Lady Immaculate scramble to get concert tickets and make plans for a prom — typical teenage business. But they also attend a symbolic peacemaking summit with a Protestant school, and they look forward to a state visit by President Bill Clinton, in hopes the US can help stabilize the region.,Season 1’s first episode establishes ,’ 1990s milieu, with its references to Macaulay Culkin and ,. But its most telling sign of the times comes with the opening image of soldiers in an armored vehicle, rolling through the Londonderry streets while the Cranberries’ “Dreams” plays on the soundtrack. Within the first minutes of episode 1, Erin’s family is hearing reports about an unexploded bomb on the bridge that leads to the school, and they’re wondering whether that day’s classes will be canceled.,At the same time, the world-weary tone the characters take to the Troubles is an immediate tip-off that ,won’t be too heavy. (Orla’s mother, on finding out that a potential explosion might keep her from hitting the tanning bed, grumbles, “I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m not enjoying this bomb.”) The political situation is just context. A more common moment for the show is when Erin’s mother won’t let her wear a denim jacket to the school instead of the Our Lady Immaculate uniform blazer. When the denim-jacketed Clare sees Erin has wussed out on their planned wardrobe switch, she quickly takes hers off too, saying, “I’m not being individual on my own!” That sort of wry humor is what , is all about. ,Fans of comedies about unruly women.,In the early 1990s, British comedian Jennifer Saunders wrote and starred in the bawdy sitcom ,, about an aging libertine and her equally wasted best friend, still trying to live like hip 20-year-olds well into their 40s. The show was enormously influential, inspiring a wave of American TV shows (like ,, ,, and ,) about ladies inclined to overindulge in everything from sex to intoxicants to the latest luxury goods. That spirit lives on in series like the Pop Channel’s current ,, where the wanton women aren’t rich, but they also aren’t letting minor setbacks like probation and unpaid bills keep them from enjoying wild times.,Similarly, the girls in , don’t let restrictive nuns or bomb threats keep them from swearing, fighting, and lusting after boys. (At least they don’t smoke, although Orla does carry a lighter because, as she says, “I just like meltin’ stuff.”) Much of the first episode is about the ladies getting sent to after-school detention for threatening to beat up an annoyingly unflappable first-year student — an offense Michelle insists was merely “, bullying,” unworthy of punishment. The big appeal of this show is that these characters’ self-centered concerns feel so real. There are bombs in the streets, but they’re more upset when a nun confiscates a lipstick that’s been discontinued. Whether viewers are willing to admit it, this kind of “But how does this affect ,?” tunnel vision is honestly relatable.,Netflix.

He even has his little toy ball, stolen from one of the control sticks on the Mandalorian’s ship in the show. ,The figure itself measures 16 and a half inches tall, made out of fabric, plastic, and resin.

BoJack Horseman was a powerful show about addiction and a messy one about celebrity,"
          Feb  5, 2020, 11:50am EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"As, progressed through its six seasons, the show’s most obvious punchline didn’t get funnier; it got scarier.,Yes, the cartoon horse was depressed. And an alcoholic. And he hurt the man with cancer. And gave the teens booze. And nearly slept with one. And tanked careers in order to save his own. And left someone to die. But when ,concluded with its final eight episodes, it wasn’t interested in a laugh so much as a reckoning.,BoJack Horseman,Everything finally catches up to BoJack, in a way. A Netflix original about a former sitcom star attempting a comeback while also dealing with addiction and depression, , followed an anthropomorphic horse who continually tried to dull the pain of his previous bad behavior with something worse. As the show grew in scope and fleshed out a large cast of characters, it explored all kinds of ideas and stories, but the two most persistent ones were directly tied to its main character: addiction and the way celebrity fosters and protects toxicity. With its finale, the show finally locks BoJack up (for breaking and entering after a near-fatal bender), following him on a break from his 14-month sentence, which was granted so he can attend his friend and former agent Princess Carolyn’s wedding.,Maybe it seems disingenuous to suggest a show that put its main character in prison for bad behavior is somehow letting him off the hook, but ,’s bittersweet farewell to its protagonist is a goodbye that chooses the parts of the show about addiction and recovery at the expense of those about abuse and power. It’s a decision that comes across as odd when the entire final season was built around taking stock of BoJack’s awful actions throughout the whole series and bringing them to light in a way that mirrors the way real-world bad men have been exposed in recent years.,When reporters piece together BoJack’s complicity in the death of his former child co-star Sarah-Lynn, along with many of his other misdeeds, the quieter life he’s come to find and love — sober, teaching college theater — comes crashing down. He gives a nationally televised interview that initially goes well for him, given our culture’s tendency to favor repentant men over their victims. Goaded by this success, BoJack does a follow-up interview, and this one reveals his pattern of abusive and predatory behavior for all the world to see. , is often overwhelmingly focused on its characters’ interiority — to the point that it had to remind the audience in stark, horrific terms that its protagonist’s selfish actions had real and devastating effects on the people around him. (One of the main ideas behind , was a cautionary tale about identifying with characters like BoJack too much.) In reminding viewers of its very large cast of characters and the ways almost all of them have been hurt or used up by BoJack,— a few to their last breath — season 6 of the show is about as damning as you can get.,Yet, Princess Carolyn’s wedding is a bittersweet finale that reads as strangely fond of BoJack. , isn’t unsympathetic to his victims. By the time the series ends, his former friends have drawn new boundaries around their lives, and it’s not particularly clear if there will be room for BoJack in them when he gets his freedom back. They all are friendly with him, sure, but he’s also presumably haunted by the ghosts of the people who won’t even see him or can’t. ,That guilt is only alluded to in the finale proper, but it’s explicitly given its due in the penultimate episode, “The View From Halfway Down,” a near-death vision of hell or purgatory that traps BoJack in a dinner party with everyone he’s ever hurt. ,’s finale, “Nice While It Lasted,” is mostly preoccupied with how a man who’s made all of these mistakes might go on with his life. ,In the end, it was always a messy idea to marry a story about mental health and addiction to a story about a powerful, abusive celebrity. Power muddies the waters, demanding a specific response when , ultimately wants to contemplate more universal ones. What do you do when you let your demons get the best of you, when you’ve done things that are unforgivable? Can you find redemption? What do you do when you’ve done awful things, and the only answer you know for sure is that life’s a bitch, and you keep living? ,A television show doesn’t owe anyone a moral roadmap for living our lives, or even a particularly moral fictional universe. BoJack can keep getting away with things, and , could probably make compelling TV out of it. (Showrunner Raphael Bob-Waksberg had , on having at least one more season.) The trouble is when , collapses two of its running themes — one of mental health and addiction and the other of power and abuse — into a single conclusion, suggesting that they complement each other when they do not. In the end, , loved BoJack Horseman too much. ,This result — a finale that asks “How does BoJack go on with his life now?”,without really giving a solid answer — is a fitting one for a show that wanted to explore the life of an awful person with unexamined mental health issues and addiction. But for the other ,, the show about a powerful celebrity who was once washed up and finds his way to relevance again through the discarded lives of the people around him, that ambiguity feels too kind. It’s dishonest about the nature of power, which lets people behave with impunity because the rules are different for them. This does not mean redemption and rehabilitation are impossible, but the rules for them, by necessity, are different, too. , never really makes that distinction, and it’s arguably poorer for it.,In this way, , recalls the finale of ,, another show that went long and hard in its final episodes to damn its protagonist, only to bid farewell wistfully as the music played and its hero, while superficially punished, enjoyed one last moment with the life they stole. Perhaps there is honesty in this — life isn’t so neat, and attempts at being good don’t always work out — but I could find a way to wish BoJack, the horse-man all-time screw-up, all the best in his life, even if I didn’t want him in mine any longer. BoJack the TV and movie star? He can rot. "
"McMillions review: finally, the burger-related true crime series we’ve been waiting for","
          Mar  2, 2020,  2:45pm EST
        ",Joshua Rivera,"It’s a good idea to have a few questions in mind whenever you order a burger. Nothing too wild. Simple stuff, like: Does this burger have cheese? (It should.) Other toppings? (Knock yourself out.) How about fries on the side? (Anything worth doing is worth doing right.) And then the most important question: Is this burger involved in a massive, years-long fraud scheme? Because, as HBO’s , would like to remind us, if you got a McDonald’s burger in the ’90s in the hopes of winning the chain’s annual Monopoly game, there was a huge criminal conspiracy devoted to robbing you of your chance to strike it rich. ,The documentary miniseries — which has aired four of six episodes — brings viewers back to the heyday of McDonald’s most successful promotion, which encouraged customers nationwide to buy fast food in order to score more Monopoly-themed game pieces. Prizes for collecting these pieces ranged from inconsequential (free fries) to massive ($1 million). And for twelve years, the game was completely rigged by a slowly expanding group of criminals who figured out how to crack the system. , devotes its hour-long episodes into slowly unspooling how this crime unfolded over its decade-plus reign, starting from the FBI agents who first started to pursue a tip they nearly dismissed outright, to the associates of the suspects they identify as the case gains traction. It’s a great story in and of itself, one ,in the summer of 2018. For the first few minutes of , however, you wonder if it’s being oversold — there’s some truly cheesy re-enactments, and the show’s initial focus makes it feel terribly narrow, like there isn’t much to hold your attention for five more hours of this. ,But there is much more, and the reasons to keep watching start piling up fast. First, there’s Agent Doug Matthews, the most prominent source early on. A junior agent in the FBI at the time the investigation into the Monopoly fraud scheme began, Matthews is such a good TV character it’s hard to believe he is, in fact, a real person. Loquacious and vain, Matthews talks with a soft drawl and heavy bravado, happy to recount his early days helping to construct an elaborate and reckless sting to draw out the fraudsters. He’s almost , eager, to the point where it starts to feel strange to essentially start rooting for the feds at a point where it’s not clear what the ,crime is. Then the bigger picture starts to come into focus, and the cast of characters expands. , quickly becomes a whirlwind tour of an unlikely underworld, full of wannabe gangsters, Southern real estate impresarios, and friendly drug dealers who look like Jerry from ,. Like a lot of the most satisfying mysteries, the who of this story is apparent early on, and the hows and whys are what keeps you watching.,Mostly, it’s extremely satisfying to get lost in a true crime tale that doesn’t revolve around a grisly murder or the grifting of everyday people — the biggest victims here are almost always McDonald’s, and the people who get too greedy as the Monopoly fraud scheme grows. ,The biggest note of discomfort in , doesn’t necessarily relate to the fraud scheme at hand, but the idea of McDonald’s. Early on in the show, the corporation is described as being eager to cooperate with the FBI because of its brand image, a talking head noting that if McDonald’s cannot be trusted thanks to some fraudsters, it would cause irreparable damage to the brand. It’s an aside that kept coming to mind as footage lifted from news reports over the last decade or so played throughout the miniseries, video that showed all manner of everyday people flocking to their local franchise to eat. ,It’s striking how ordinary they are in comparison to the louder cast of characters that , follows. They’re an unassuming bunch of people, presumably doing what they need to do to get through an already-too-stressful day. They remind me of the times I ate McDonald’s as a kid, one of too many mouths to feed on not enough money, and then again as an adult, stretched thin and aware that it was sold to me by people paid too little, stretched as thin as I was, for the benefit of suits who, frankly, did not care. It would be a shame if anything happened to that brand image, though. "
"Disney Plus now streams The Simpsons in its proper aspect ratio, but it wasn’t easy","
          May 28, 2020,  1:30pm EDT
        ",Julia Alexander,"Earlier seasons of ,are finally available to ,, a task Disney Plus’ product team had to spend some time figuring out. ,Aspect ratios are a big deal in ,. Fox originally aired the show in 1989, and at the time used a 4:3 aspect ratio. The show, as any fan will explain, relies heavily on visual gags — an aspect of joke-telling that wouldn’t become an issue until near the end of 2009, about a third of the way through ,’ 20th season — when the show’s aspect ratio switched from 4:3 to 16:9. When Disney , to Disney Plus in November 2019, every episode was only available in 16:9, meaning older episodes looked stretched out, and jokes that relied on visual framing were effectively cut out. ,The Disney Plus product team knew they had to fix it, but it wasn’t as simple as adding old files. Disney Plus subscribers now just have to switch a toggle on ,’,description page when they open the app. Essentially, the Disney Streaming Services product team had to rethink how content was packaged for streaming purposes, one that Joe Rice, vice president of media product, called a “fundamental change” in a ,.,Prior to Disney’s team packaging both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios in one content package (a group of audiovisual components including video, audio languages, formats, and subtitles), the believed assumption was only “a single version of video would be present in any given package,” Rice wrote.,The team created multiple “facets,” which essentially created flexible combinations of audio, video, and subtitle components. As part of the fix, it doesn’t matter what chosen aspect ratio people use to watch ,, but basic features like “Continue Watching” or autoplay will continue to work. This was paramount to the team, Rice explained. Those existing features were crucial to the Disney Plus streaming experience, with Rice adding that new “4:3 versions couldn’t be treated as standalone bonus content.” ,Here’s a fun side-by-side to show the difference in how streams are now bundled. They’re packaged together, so once people toggle to select the aspect ratio they want, the version is pulled from the same package and everything reacts seamlessly. ,“To support both the original 4:3 aspect ratio and the 16:9 versions of ,, we needed to challenge prior assumptions and rethink how content for streaming is packaged and delivered,” said Rice. “We introduced a new Disney+ app feature today that not only gives fans a choice in video viewing formats, but also opens up a number of exciting opportunities for novel ways of presenting content in the future.”"
