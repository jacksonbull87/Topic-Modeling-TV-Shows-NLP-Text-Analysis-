5,Mindy Kaling’s new teen sitcom Never Have I Ever is an empathetic exploration of grief,2020-05-01,Joshua Rivera,"If you told everyone exactly how high school would play out, odds are many would opt the hell out. High school in America is a bizarre and unkind time, a collective coming-of-age story that has as much room for variety as there are people who go through it. ,, a new Netflix sitcom from , creator Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher, takes the broad strokes of high school and gives them new life by centering its story on an Indian-American girl. It’s an absolute delight, one of the most pleasant new binge-watches you can do right now. ,That doesn’t mean the show is all sunshine — , begins with a tragedy when protagonist Devi Vishwakumar’s (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) father Mohan (Sendhil Ramamurthy) suddenly dies, and shortly after, Devi inexplicably loses the use of her legs. (This is all in the first few minutes). As Devi is starting to get used to life without her father and with her disability, her mobility returns, just as curiously as it left. , is the story of Devi’s attempt to return to a normal life, and Devi wants to return with a bang — literally, by losing her virginity to Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet) the hottest boy in school. ,Perhaps this might not strike you as a healthy thing for someone, real or fictional, to do. That would be the point: , isn’t just an Indian-American take on the coming-of-age story, but also a story that takes teen rom-com tropes and turns them into a vehicle for exploring grief. None of this ever takes a backseat to ,’s comedy or its earnest, empathetic storytelling. The show strives to keep its stakes small and focused on Devi and her friends and family, but they’re surrounded by a cast of friends and family diverse and interesting enough to support a much bigger show. ,While each character can’t have a subplot of their own, they’re all afforded the potential for depth. Every character is going through something, experiencing their foundational traumas in real time. The central conflict of the show is Devi’s inability to see this, slowly realizing that the process of dealing with her own extraordinary grief blinds her to what others are experiencing, and that dealing with that grief poorly can also cost her the connections that will help her move on. ,Again: ,is also a very good comedy that consistently delights. There’s clever and fun narration from tennis superstar John McEnroe (there’s a reason for this); a bright, danceable soundtrack that prominently features Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own” in the pilot and stays in that sonic milieu throughout; and it features a cast of wonderfully charismatic young actors. , feels like what would have been a cult favorite in a previous generation of television, a ,-style one-season wonder. But times are very different now, and an Indian-American lead is a refreshing change for this type of show — especially one that might last.",if you told everyone exactly how high school would play out odds are many would opt the hell out high school in america is a bizarre and unkind time a collective coming of age story that has as much room for variety as there are people who go through it a new netflix sitcom from creator mindy kaling and lang fisher takes the broad strokes of high school and gives them new life by centering its story on an indian american girl it s an absolute delight one of the most pleasant new binge watches you can do right now that doesn t mean the show is all sunshine begins with a tragedy when protagonist devi vishwakumar s maitreyi ramakrishnan father mohan sendhil ramamurthy suddenly dies and shortly after devi inexplicably loses the use of her legs this is all in the first few minutes as devi is starting to get used to life without her father and with her disability her mobility returns just as curiously as it left is the story of devi s attempt to return to a normal life and devi wants to return with a bang literally by losing her virginity to paxton hall yoshida darren barnet the hottest boy in school perhaps this might not strike you as a healthy thing for someone real or fictional to do that would be the point isn t just an indian american take on the coming of age story but also a story that takes teen rom com tropes and turns them into a vehicle for exploring grief none of this ever takes a backseat to s comedy or its earnest empathetic storytelling the show strives to keep its stakes small and focused on devi and her friends and family but they re surrounded by a cast of friends and family diverse and interesting enough to support a much bigger show while each character can t have a subplot of their own they re all afforded the potential for depth every character is going through something experiencing their foundational traumas in real time the central conflict of the show is devi s inability to see this slowly realizing that the process of dealing with her own extraordinary grief blinds her to what others are experiencing and that dealing with that grief poorly can also cost her the connections that will help her move on again is also a very good comedy that consistently delights there s clever and fun narration from tennis superstar john mcenroe there s a reason for this a bright danceable soundtrack that prominently features robyn s dancing on my own in the pilot and stays in that sonic milieu throughout and it features a cast of wonderfully charismatic young actors feels like what would have been a cult favorite in a previous generation of television a style one season wonder but times are very different now and an indian american lead is a refreshing change for this type of show especially one that might last ,told everyone exactly high school would play odds many would opt hell high school america bizarre unkind time collective coming age story much room variety people new netflix sitcom creator mindy kaling lang fisher take broad stroke high school give new life centering story indian american girl absolute delight one pleasant new binge watch right mean show sunshine begin tragedy protagonist devi vishwakumar maitreyi ramakrishnan father mohan sendhil ramamurthy suddenly dy shortly devi inexplicably loses use leg first minute devi starting get used life without father disability mobility return curiously left story devi attempt return normal life devi want return bang literally losing virginity paxton hall yoshida darren barnet hottest boy school perhaps might strike healthy thing someone real fictional would point indian american take coming age story also story take teen rom com trope turn vehicle exploring grief none ever take backseat comedy earnest empathetic storytelling show strives keep stake small focused devi friend family surrounded cast friend family diverse interesting enough support much bigger show character subplot afforded potential depth every character going something experiencing foundational trauma real time central conflict show devi inability see slowly realizing process dealing extraordinary grief blind others experiencing dealing grief poorly also cost connection help move also good comedy consistently delight clever fun narration tennis superstar john mcenroe reason bright danceable soundtrack prominently feature robyn dancing pilot stay sonic milieu throughout feature cast wonderfully charismatic young actor feel like would cult favorite previous generation television style one season wonder time different indian american lead refreshing change type show especially one might last

7,Netflix miniseries Hollywood isn’t the inspiration it thinks it is,2020-05-05,Joshua Rivera,"There’s a scene in , for ,, a musical about the life of P.T. Barnum, where Hugh Jackman grins at Zach Efron for saying he does not know what “show business” is. “That’s because I’ve just invented it,” he tells him, cheekily. Like a zombie show where the characters somehow do not know what zombies are, this little bit of irony is fun or grating, depending on the type of person you are. But hardly anyone wants to deal with an entire show full of that. ,, a new Netflix miniseries from Ryan Murphy, is an entire show full of that.,Murphy is perhaps the buzziest maker of television in the business. With this latest project, the writer / director (who co-created the series with frequent collaborator Ian Brennan), who is behind shows like , and , brings his distinct slick, sensational style to the Golden Age of showbiz. Bawdy and transgressive, it starts with a flair and energy that’s hard to look away from, tremendously watchable from minute one. Trouble is, it’s impossible to parse what the show wants to even be ,.  , is an alt-history story about a cast of mostly fictional strivers trying to make it big in 1940s Los Angeles.

They’re gay, women, not white, or some combination of the three. They are, by design, people who would have never, ever stood a chance in Old Hollywood, at least not without finding some way to pass. This is the first aim of the show: a rewrite of the well-worn dream-big story, but one starring people who weren’t allowed to be a part of it, and one where they win. ,But the series isn’t just a rosy what-if fable. ,also has ambitions of being a much-needed corrective to our overly simplistic view of the Hollywood that was. The show echoes works like , and the book / documentary ,, offering a look into a more hedonistic side of the Golden Age of show business. This Hollywood was not carefully laundered for mass consumption, a Dreamland where big-name stars had hookups arranged by fixers that conducted business out of a gas station front and secretly gay and bisexual actors and producers threw exclusive parties where they could be secrets no longer. ,In this, the miniseries wants to have its cake and eat it, too. , shows the era for its ugliness — the homophobia, racism, and sexism that shut out marginalized talent for decades — and dreams a new dream where it wasn’t enough to stop our heroes. But its other goal of disabusing viewers of the wholesome myth embodied by the films of the era gets incredibly messy fast. ,Part of the problem is that , is not entirely built around fictional characters. Real names enter and leave the drama throughout, from Hattie McDaniel (Queen Latifah) to Anna May Wong (Michelle Krusiec), real people who did the impossible present to bolster the egos of characters that never existed and therefore, arguably, their creators. Then there’s Henry Wilson (an impressively nasty Jim Parsons), a real-life talent agent who was famous for developing the era’s leading men. He was also, as ,makes , clear, alleged to be the Harvey Weinstein of his day, coercing young men into sex in exchange for parts and stardom. On the show, one of those men is the aspiring actor whom Wilson turns into Rock Hudson — a curious choice since the show barely seems interested in the real Rock Hudson’s biography. ,It’s hard not to see the twin ambitions of , as utterly at odds with each other. The truth-telling of its nastier side inspired by the real version of history undercuts the earnestness of its wish-fulfillment, making it seem cloying and saccharine. In turn, that earnest part of the show makes its forays into Old Hollywood’s real-world underbelly feel exploitative and cheap. There is too much friction between the two for them to build a cohesive whole, and, as a result, the whole enterprise is compromised at best and condescending at worst. ,Like most people involved in the Hollywood of the real world, the characters of , are utterly convinced that everything they’re doing is ,important. They make dreams real, you see, telling stories so that others can see them and be inspired to believe that they can do it, too. We , to have a version of this story where the marginalized succeed because we need them to inspire a more diverse future version of Hollywood so that Hollywood can go on. ,But the show ,wants you to know that it represents a business where abusers thrive, sex can be traded for power, and bigoted men can build systems that protect their interests and extend their reach. That’s just as much a part of show business as the brown kid who gets it in their head that they can make it, matter just as much as the white ones, and become an example that inspires countless others back home. It’s telling that while ,’s marginalized characters find success, its biggest abuser is ambiguously reformed, allowed to stay in the business of dreams after only a few scenes of feeling sorry about it all. ,These are two sides of the same coin: the pernicious reach of the powerful and the inspiring success stories that launder their reputation. In tying the two together once more, the series just props up the old system it thinks it’s subverting. Hollywood’s greatest production has always been Hollywood.

8,How to be a Rick and Morty fan,2020-05-07,Joshua Rivera,"After a mid-season hiatus, ,returned on May 3rd with the first of five episodes to close out its fourth season. The series is as good as it’s always been — shockingly crass but also sharp, easily one of the funniest and most inventive shows on television. As a cultural object, however, there have been problems around its fans. You know, they’re terrible.,It’s been ,, fueled by a comment that went viral on Reddit. “You have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty,” the post begins, claiming that much of its humor would go over the average viewer’s head. “People who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase ‘Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,’ which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic ,Like anything so obviously Online, it’s impossible to tell if this post is sincere or satire, but it definitely struck a chord.

10,HBO Max will use anime from Crunchyroll to compete with Netflix’s growing empire,2020-05-07,Julia Alexander,"Netflix is trying to become a dominant presence in the anime streaming space, but AT&T-owned WarnerMedia is leveraging its dedicated anime streaming service Crunchyroll to help ,. ,HBO Max subscribers will be able to stream 17 different anime series currently available on Crunchyroll, including ,, ,, and,Crunchyroll will curate new anime content for HBO Max subscribers every three months, according to WarnerMedia, with popular series , and ,coming to HBO Max later this year.

While HBO Max won’t be the exclusive home — shows will run on both HBO Max and Crunchyroll at the same time — subscribers will have more access to popular anime.,Although these are just a smattering of titles compared to the 1,000-plus series on Crunchyroll, the hope is to “introduce anime to a wider audience who appreciates compelling stories told through this dynamic medium,” according to Crunchyroll’s general manager, Joanne Waage. ,It’s a win-win for the two streaming platforms, both owned by AT&T. If mainstream audiences subscribing to HBO Max develop an affinity for anime being provided through Crunchyroll, they could potentially sign up for the anime streaming service in addition to HBO.

WarnerMedia will also use HBO Max as the exclusive home for Studio Ghibli’s films in the United States, as Netflix secured the international rights to the popular and critically acclaimed films. ,Both Netflix and Amazon have spent millions of dollars investing in developing new original anime series and licensing top titles. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings expressed , that anime was a core area Netflix wanted to invest in.

The service will also carry current and former HBO series (widely considered the heart of the streaming service), Warner Bros. movies, TBS and TNT original series, and some CW shows. WarnerMedia, like ViacomCBS (CBS All Access) and NBCUniversal (Peacock), has one of the largest collections of titles that HBO Max can borrow from to use for its own service. ,Other anime series that will be available on HBO Max, and are currently on Crunchyroll, include ,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and,HBO Max launches on May 27th for $14.99 a month.

12,"New trailers: Space Force, The King of Staten Island, Becoming, and more",2020-05-09,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I watched HBO’s new film , last week. The whole thing felt a bit like a heist movie in reverse — it’s about a superintendent who’s stealing money from his school district, only you’re watching as the crime unravels, rather than as it plays out.,It’s a fun film, in large part thanks to Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney taking on some big characters. But the movie also takes the course a lot of true-story movies do, where they worry more about telling you what happened than they do about building characters.,I think this works to a point. It’s a wild story, and they do an entertaining job telling it. But I wish the film pushed a little further into who these people are. Showing the crime only as it’s unraveled is a cool way to tell the story, but it also means we don’t get to learn much about what anyone is doing until it’s a bit too late.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Almost a decade after leaving ,, Steve Carell has a new sitcom. While , is a workplace comedy, and Carell is once again playing a boss, he’s taking on a very different role than Michael Scott. In ,, he seems to be the one everyone else is playing off, and there’s a great cast around him. It looks like it’s off to a funny start. The show debuts May 29th.,It’s been a while since we got a new Judd Apatow comedy. His first feature since , five years ago stars Pete Davidson as a slacker still living at home, who suddenly has to start being responsible for some young kids.

It’s hard to imagine fans won’t find something to enjoy here, though , the documentary is less revealing than the book. The film hit Netflix earlier this week.,HBO has a documentary adaptation of Michelle McNamara’s investigation into the Golden State Killer, and like the book, it seems to pull in McNamara’s obsession around finding the culprit in a big way. The documentary comes to HBO on June 28th.,Hearing your friends’ stories about being high and laughing at dumb stuff is never as funny as they imagine it’s going to be. But... it might be a little different when it’s famous people telling you stories about being high, and that seems to be what , is all about.

13,Quibi will add sharing features as the app struggles to find subscribers,2020-05-11,Julia Alexander,"To say that Quibi is off to a disastrous start would be an understatement.

But Katzenberg is hopeful that rolling out new features will help, including giving subscribers the ability to share content from Quibi shows on social media. ,When Quibi launched at the beginning of April, the app blocked sharing to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit. Now, Katzenberg and the team are working on ways to ensure Quibi is “less walled off from the internet.” People will eventually be able to share Quibi content on social media, but there’s no estimated time frame for when that feature will become available. ,(,Verge,),“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right,” Katzenberg said, “but now that there are hundreds of people on there using it, you go, ‘Uh-oh, we didn’t see that.’”,People also ,. Although that restriction isn’t unique to Quibi (Netflix and Disney Plus deal with the same problem in their mobile apps), without a desktop version of the app for people to watch Quibi shows on, the only way for people to share scenes was to use another phone to record the episode playing.

Android users might have to wait a bit longer for Chromecast support.

Quibi currently has about 3.5 million app downloads and 1.3 million active users, according to Katzenberg. ,That’s a far cry from Disney Plus’ , and YouTube’s more than 2 billion monthly users, 70 percent of which ,.

16,HBO is teaming up with Scener to give subscribers the ability to watch TV together,2020-05-14,Julia Alexander,"People stuck in quarantine who might want to watch ,or ,with friends and family have the option to do so using Scener. ,, an online video chatting tool that allows people to sign in to their Netflix accounts to watch movies and TV shows with friends who also subscribe to the services, is adding HBO to people’s viewing options. Anyone with an HBO Now or HBO Go subscription in the United States can boot up the streaming service, create a private virtual theater for up to 20 people, and watch any title. Scener marks the first major partnership between WarnerMedia’s HBO network and an online co-viewing platform. ,Joe Braidwood, Scener’s co-founder, knew that finding an easy way to give people the ability to stream and hang out with their friends online that also worked within the fragile copyright rules crucial to studios and streamers was important. Braidwood just “didn’t predict it would be a pandemic that makes it mainstream,” he told ,“When the pandemic hit, we saw a crazy surge in demand for our product,” Braidwood added. ,It wasn’t long after that various shelter-in-place orders went into effect around the United States. As more people stayed home, WarnerMedia reached out to Scener about a partnership. Scener and WarnerMedia started working together in March. The new partnership accompanies a new design for the site, including a recent update that helps to  ease the stress on Google Chrome browsers running the app.,“We used to overlay the video and social channels, which injected a lot of code at once leading to a lot of stability issues in Netflix,” Braidwood said. “People were running out of memory because so much was happening on one Chrome tab.”,Since the update’s rolled out, Scener’s received a wave of positive feedback. Something it was hopeful for as usage started skyrocketing was seeing active usage increase 15 times on the legacy product, he said. Having HBO on board was added pressure. Co-watching isn’t a new concept, but “the approach that we take is a very safe and compatible with HBO’s vision,” Braidwood said. HBO, a network that deals with its most popular shows winding up on piracy sites hours after episodes air, wants to ensure that subscribers have the opportunity to watch shows with their friends they can’t see, but not at a cost to their network. ,Piracy is, of course, an issue that Hollywood studios and networks think about, but so does Braidwood. Sites like Twitch often play host to pirated content being streamed by individual users. It’s how some ,, one of HBO’s most successful series. Twitch works to take them down, but on Sunday nights when ,was airing, there seemed to be a new stream for every one removed. ,Part of the appeal of watching a show or movie on Twitch and over Discord is socialization through chat. Braidwood thinks of the current moment like the music industry. Napster became a problem the industry was forced to figure out, and part of the solution came in the form of Spotify. ,“It wasn’t until Spotify’s delightful UX and revenue split that the industry started to move past that problem,” Braidwood said. “Yes, people download and pirate movies, and streaming them on Discord and Twitch, but the majority of people don’t have the time or the patience for that. They want a delightful, easy experience.” ,Scener isn’t the only company trying to get ahead of the co-viewing trend. Amazon, which owns Twitch, is letting streamers , that are available on ,, the company’s streaming service. Everyone who wants in on the party has to subscribe to Amazon Prime, similar to how people who use Scener have subscriptions to Netflix, HBO Now, or HBO Go. Studios and streaming platforms are looking at co-viewing now more than ever because the pandemic has created an increase in demand, but Braidwood doesn’t think co-viewing will only stick around while people are at home. ,“There are watershed moments in history where black swan events change human behavior; that couldn’t be more true for America right now,” Braidwood said. “This is one of the first milestones that starts tracking the new path of co-viewing becoming more than just a trend. We think the sky’s the limit.”",people stuck in quarantine who might want to watch or with friends and family have the option to do so using scener an online video chatting tool that allows people to

17,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is back on Netflix, but don’t start with the first episode",2020-05-21,Joshua Rivera," is back on Netflix after a seven-year absence, and if you never caught the show, now is a perfect time. ,isn’t just one of the best animated series around; it’s full-stop excellent television regardless of format. This might not be clear from episode 1, though. As premieres go, it’s charming but geared toward hooking children. Skepticism is okay! Just don’t pass it by without diving into one of its best episodes, “Zuko Alone” (season 2, episode 7). It’s a standalone tale that explains everything you need to know — a terrific martial arts Western with surprisingly rich characterization and a gut-punch ending — all in 20 minutes. ,In ,there are four nations, each based on the mastery of a different element: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air. The Fire Nation declared war on the others, and the series is about children caught up in this war. Most episodes focus on Aang, the titular Avatar, the only person in the world with the ability to master all four elements and prophesied to restore balance. The only problem: he’s a child and not quite in command of every element yet. Through a mix of standalone and serial episodes, , follows Aang and his young friends as they help him on his journey to master the elements, while pursued by Fire Nation and stymied by adults in power.,“Zuko Alone” focuses on the young Prince Zuko, one of the show’s primary antagonists, exiled from the Fire Nation after a humiliating failure, left to wander on his own. The episode is removed from the show’s highly serialized plot. Like in a good Western, Zuko takes on the archetypal role of The Man With No Name. He arrives at a small frontier town for rest and a meal when he encounters a conflict: crooked Earth Kingdom soldiers are terrorizing the villagers they’re supposed to protect. As a once-proud member of the invading nation, Zuko has been a villain unaccustomed to caring about others. In exile however, his priorities are slowly shifting, and he decides to intervene. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the plot of ,, one of the most beloved and regularly homaged Westerns.) ,In “Zuko Alone,” the former prince finally gets a chance to see what he’s represented all this time to the people outside of the Fire Nation. His internal conflict is externalized by his decision to hide his identity, and the unspoken idea that his new friends might not respond so kindly if they knew who he was. ,One reason , is loved by its fans is the way it refuses to talk down to its audience. Like Phillip Pullman’s YA trilogy ,, it’s a show that rarely simplifies things to “good” or “evil,” letting its protagonists be selfish and wrong at times and giving its antagonists depth whenever possible. In the world of ,, characters are caught between compassion and conflict, and war provides them with regular opportunity to behave nobly or selfishly. That its main characters are all children only underlines all of this. The frequent goofy hijinks and moments of weakness are all normal parts of growing up, and no matter how much we’d like it to be, growing up does not happen in a vacuum. It happens out in the world where there is conflict, war, and pain. The children of , want to be kids, but they’re also inheriting the world of their parents and are just starting to see it for what it is — but they’re not yet jaded enough to stop seeing what it could be. ,This is what makes “Zuko Alone” a good introduction to ,: it’s a small character study of one of these kids, scarred in more ways than one, coming to terms with all manner of consequence — the cost of his decisions, the burden of his place in the world, the limits of his control over how others perceive him, and the potential he still has to become who he wants to be, under his old name or not. ,That’s pretty good stuff for a kid’s show. , ", is back on netflix after a seven year absence and if you never caught the show now is a perfect time isn t just one of the best animated series

18,Rick and Morty’s Chris Parnell thinks Jerry would do very well in quarantine,2020-05-11,Joshua Rivera,"Chris Parnell is a normcore comedy assassin. After a career in improv,  two stints on ,, and countless roles on sitcoms like , and animated shows like ,, Parnell has perfected the art of using his extremely average appearance — and voice — to deliver disarmingly strange, ridiculous and deadpan comedy. Few are better at making the act of looking like a relatively normal dude and keeping a straight face so , (,).,This is why, as Jerry Smith, Parnell is an essential part of what makes , work. His ability to adopt an aw-shucks affectation even as he bears witness to some of the most bizarre things committed to animation makes him one of the most endearing aspects of the show.,Recently, Parnell spoke with,in a phone call from Los Angeles, where the actor is currently self-quarantined with his family, for a conversation about Jerry’s quarantine odds, ,fans, and what he’s up to during isolation. ,This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.,: You know, every time that I do it after it’s been a long break, I have to find it a little bit, but the voice is not that different than my voice and it’s just sort of tapping into Jerry. But the writing is so good, it’s so much of joy on the page and what the writers create so that it’s really just kind of trying to bring that to life. As long as I’m true to that and being present while I’m recording and all that, it’s not too challenging to get back into Jerry.,Pretty much everything that I do is just solo record sessions, which I enjoy. The hardest thing I think is just remembering to really be present and try to act it well and not just kind of say the lines. So there’s a fair bit of visualization going on in my head and trying to sort of put myself in that place and see it. And it’s very freeing in that there’s no camera on me, so it doesn’t matter what I’m doing with my hands and arms and the way I’m gesticulating or whatever, which I do a fair bit of when I record voiceover. So you’re really just taking all of this energy and funneling it through your voice without being able to see anything which you’re doing physically. Although, obviously, what I do physically with my face and my body is going to affect how my voice sounds.,But yeah, I mean, I feel lucky that I get to do both things. Both the live action and the animated stuff. Obviously, these days it tends to be mostly the animation, but I get to do enough guest star appearances on sitcoms or the occasional movie part or things like that. I get to have that one-on-one interaction with other actors actually with us looking at each other and saying things to each other, so that’s very nice to get to do both.,Would I? Sure. I mean, I probably have at some level. I mean, I’ve certainly done a lot of characters that are ,.,I don’t think so, honestly. Not to be Mr. Tough Guy, but when you’ve had a background doing The Groundlings like I have and once you do live improv shows and stuff like that, there’s really... almost anything goes. And then ,. I mean, people who have been a part of comedy for an extended period of time, as I’ve been fortunate enough to be, for the vast majority of us anyway, there’s not really much that shocks us. Part of doing comedy is doing things that are shocking and surprising and ridiculous, so I don’t know I’ve ever actually encountered anything with Jerry that I was like, “Oh boy. Wow.”,I don’t interact with fans a lot mainly because I’m not on social media, and the only real time for that interaction is at the occasional convention, like Comic-Con or whatever that Adult Swim will send us to. And that’s awesome and that’s really fun and that’s a great time to get to see the crowd react to the screening of an episode or in doing a panel and hearing their questions, so it becomes tangible in a way that it’s not usually. ,But I actually find it freeing to not have to try to do something for an immediate audience reaction and just sort of hope that what I’m doing is funny or whatever it’s supposed to be. And once it’s all put together and animated — obviously, the animation is a big part of it — that people will react in a good way and laugh at [Jerry]. I don’t mind not having that immediate reaction, in a strange way.,I don’t, really. I mean, occasionally I’ll hear that somebody is being nasty or misogynistic or something, but I don’t... other than the broad colors like that. I know that’s very much the minority, but yeah, I don’t have a huge sense of what it’s like.,Yeah? I believe that. ,Well, Rick is fairly amoral. He makes a lot of questionable or outright terrible choices, so I guess there’s going to be people that relate to that in a very particular way and sort of revel in that. ,Any time people get really excited and, dare I say, rabid about something, there’s probably going to be some nastiness involved — and also just inherent in, obviously, social media and people communicating without having to be looking at somebody face to face. Then maybe just the nihilistic nature of , and the darkness of it sort of brings something extra out of some of the fans.,My sons are six and three, so they don’t watch ,, even though they do have some of the plushies and little hard plastic figurines. I mean, my six-year-old knows who Mr. Poopy Butthole is, you know? Other than watching the show with my wife and the bit of feedback I get from her, but we don’t really take the show apart or anything. I’m not sure if my sister watches it. My parents definitely don’t. ,Well, I think Jerry would actually do pretty well with it. I think he would just find some little projects to engage himself with and focus on those and feel proud of his little victories he might have. I know he’s going to be taking up, on some level, beekeeping in these upcoming episodes. So yeah, I don’t think it would be too rough on Jerry. ,Well, I’m on the fourth book of the , series by Dan Simmons. I don’t know if you know that at all, but it’s a great, great science fiction series. I mean, just extraordinary. So I’m making my way through the fourth and last book of that series, and then my wife and I, we have to find shows that we both want to watch at night after the kids are in bed. We love John Oliver, like so many people do. We love Bill Maher and Samantha Bee, we’re fans of hers, and we also watch ,and ,. My wife turned me on to those shows back many years ago, and so, although I never thought I’d be watching reality TV, I do. I am now invested slightly in the lives of those women.,Yeah. Yeah. A lot of it I cannot watch. Like, I have no interest in , or certain shows where I just feel like people are not particularly interesting, but yeah. And then lately my wife’s been having these sort of meetups with some of the other ladies in our neighborhood where they’ll just sit out on the street in lawn chairs and keep their distance, their social distance, and chat. But I’m still catching up with this show,,.,Right? I’ve still got a couple more episodes of, what, season 3, I guess? But yeah, that’s a little treat.",chris parnell is a normcore comedy assassin after a career in improv two stints on and countless roles on sitcoms like and animated shows like parnell has perfected

20,Netflix’s The Eddy is a can’t-miss trip to Paris — with one bad detour,2020-05-14,Joshua Rivera,"The most upsetting thing about ,is that it’s already over. Netflix’s latest bingeable show is a limited series, an eight-episode run about a jazz club in Paris. Produced by Academy Award-winning ,and ,director Damien Chazelle (who directed the first two episodes) and written by acclaimed playwright Jack Thorne, ,y feels like it brings something truly new to the , original series the streaming giant has cultivated of late, and it’s one of the most visually rewarding shows in your queue this year. ,The series follows Elliot (André Holland, terrific) as he struggles to keep his jazz club, The Eddy, afloat during a particularly bad time. His house band is on the verge of getting signed, but bad luck keeps getting in the way. His daughter, Julie (Amandla Stenberg), is now living with him after a bad time with her mother in the States, and she’s acting out. There’s a famous producer interested in his band, but he’s flighty, and the band needs some work. And then his partner, Farid (Tahar Rahim), is murdered.,That last bit is easily the worst thing about ,. The show follows this murder plot through its entirety, grafting a half-baked crime drama onto a superb European hangout. Everything that the series might need from a shocking death — an avenue to explore grief and fuel for character implosions — could conceivably be achieved by replacing Farid’s murder with any other sort of unexpected death. That it chooses to commit so fully to this plotline is baffling, with many scenes of cops and heavies and menacing phone calls just rudely making a mess of what’s otherwise extremely good. ,Sometimes, when writing about TV, you have to be careful to avoid criticizing a series for not being what you want it to be, instead of what it is. , sincerely seems like it wants to be a meandering tale that’s mostly about nothing, just hardscrabble music lovers feeling things and making self-destructive choices on a small scale. Why spend an episode on the bassist who suffers through a day as the third wheel between his former love and her new beau? Or another on a singer’s struggle with her self-worth, caught between two men who want to use her talents to advance their careers and a mother who has never even heard the word “boundaries” in her life? Why film Paris so unromantically, with a wonderful, lived-in feeling, with characters that flow from English to French to Arabic? Why work so hard to marry these tiny dramas to such fantastic music? ,And yes, in keeping with Damien Chazelle projects like ,and ,, , is incredibly good at visually conveying what it feels like to perform music: to be in it and making it at once. In directing the first two episodes, Chazelle sets a standard for this that isn’t ,consistently met throughout — you will notice later episodes dial back his frenetic energy a bit — but they all understand what music , to these characters and work hard to make sure you do, too. ,Above all else, , is a show to be experienced. It’s a shame that its gritty crime plot feels like it comes from a different show entirely — one that wants to shock and pull you from one episode to the next, instead of trusting you will simply flow there with the current. But it’s a small price to pay for some wonderful, textured television.

21,The Snowpiercer TV show slows down a thrilling train ride,2020-05-18,Joshua Rivera,", Bong Joon-ho’s gripping sci-fi film, doesn’t seem like a natural fit for television. A tense post-apocalyptic story where the remnants of humanity succumb to class warfare on an endlessly running train, the movie was a finely tuned thriller that also succinctly articulated its themes. More of something isn’t always a good thing. You run the risk of diluting it, especially when the leaner medium of TV forces you to reproduce the original on a tighter budget. There are good ways to do this, but TNT’s , series has found probably the most mundane way to pull it off. ,Ironically, the first change in ,’s TV adaptation, despite being a television cliché, is a really good one: making its protagonist a detective. The broad strokes are otherwise mostly the same as the 2014 film. When our climate crisis reaches an untenable state, scientists inadvertently create another one, making the planet inhospitably cold. In order to save humanity, a 1,001-car supertrain is built to endlessly circumnavigate the globe, a place for the human race to ride out the apocalypse — provided they can buy a ticket. Those who do are stratified by wealth, with the rich in luxe cars up front and the poor stowaways who forced their way aboard penned in the back, living in squalor. ,Layton (Daveed Diggs) is one of those “tailies,” eking out a miserable existence as his cohorts plan a revolution. Things are complicated, however, when Layton is recruited by the people in charge because he is the only passenger who was a former homicide detective, and there is a murder that needs solving — one that slowly, over the show’s first season, causes the fraught balance of the Snowpiercer population to fall apart. ,Shifting the story’s perspective to a detective is a smart way to make ,interesting over 10 hour-long episodes. , quickly shows why: Layton’s recruitment allows him to introduce viewers to the world as it’s been re-created aboard the eponymous train, drifting from car to car as the story requires. Check it out: there’s a nightclub car, a twisted morgue where troublesome individuals are put in suspended animation and stashed in drawers, a school car, suites for the first class, okay rooms for fourth class, and so on. ,This is where dilution starts to be a bit of a problem. , wasn’t a terribly subtle film, turning the evils of capitalism into a speeding freight train that hurtles at the viewer, but every way it expounded on its sci-fi future felt vital. As a TV show, , has to be about more things and show the audience more of the world in order to build a longer, serial story. Unfortunately, that longer story is a drag. ,There’s some really good stuff. The third episode, in particular, “Access Is Power,” delves into the train’s circular, closed economy and the way nothing is ever wasted as passengers from front to tail barter everything imaginable in order to get a peek at life above their station. But the majority of ,feels perfunctory. It’s a competent show that’s efficiently made and is steadily working toward its big season-ending goal of revolution, just like the movie. But lacking the urgency of a shorter runtime, it’s not an engrossing experience, just a nice idle one. ,Watching ,, I found myself wishing it was , of a detective show. Something more strictly episodic, with Layton being asked to investigate a different case every week, would give the show’s writers and directors enough to make the show different every episode. Unfortunately, like every passenger on ,, once you’re on this particular train, you’ve got no choice but to barrel ahead toward the same destination as everyone else.

22,Stargirl doesn’t know what to do with its superhero nostalgia,2020-05-22,Joshua Rivera,"Here’s something that can be easy to forget about comic book superheroes, given how popular they’ve become over the last decade: they’re really quite old. This is especially true for DC Comics characters like Batman and Superman, who were created in the 1930s. Comic books were extremely different then, and many superheroes of the Golden Age were specific to their era in ways that don’t necessarily translate to modern success outside of the odd period piece. , is a modern love letter to those old superheroes, but it never really sells you on , you should love them., — which you can watch Mondays on DC Universe or a slightly edited for broadcasting on the CW on Tuesdays — begins 10 years before the present day in the middle of the final battle between the Justice Society of America and the Injustice Society. The good guys (guess which ones those are) lose — badly. In his final act, the superhero Starman (Joel McHale, of all people) gives his sidekick Pat “Stripey” Dugan (Luke Wilson) the source of his power, the Cosmic Staff, telling him someday, someone worthy of it should get it — just not Stripey. ,Ten years later, that person turns out to be Courtney Whitmore (Brec Bassinger), Dugan’s new stepdaughter. Courtney’s life is about to get a big shakeup as she and her mother, Barbara (Amy Smart), are about to move Blue Valley, Nebraska, with Pat and his terrible son Mike (Trae Romano). Shortly after the move, Courtney finds Pat’s collection of Justice Society memorabilia along with the Cosmic Staff, which appears to have a mind of its own and seems to choose Courtney as Starman’s replacement. ,Unfortunately for her, the former members of the Injustice Society are still around and would very much like Starman to have , replacement. And so the stage is set: Courtney becomes Stargirl, Pat becomes her backup / mentor, and the former Injustice Society members are the villains. ,Much of ,is devoted to nostalgia. Blue Valley is the very picture of good fashioned Americana: a bustling Main Street, a homey-looking suburb, and a general pleasantness that keeps Pat Dugan’s aw-shucks demeanor, ‘50s roadster, and teal icebox-style fridge from feeling out of place. While the local high school is sufficiently diverse, Blue Valley is a town that appears untouched by said diversity, the lily-white Dugan / Whitmore household the town’s unspoken standard. ,There’s also more overt nostalgia in the way that , is secretly about bringing back the Justice Society of America, a set of DC superheroes that embody the old-school heroics of a simpler world. Throughout the first three episodes made available to critics, , slowly starts to suggest that there , be a point to all of this: Blue Valley’s wholesome Americana might be exploited by the civilian alter-egos of the Injustice Society, as a plan to restore the town seems to have a secret sinister motivation. There’s also the fact that Courtney / Stargirl is rebuilding the JSA with a new generation of recruits, which hints that the show might display some interest in the disparity between Blue Valley as idealized by the previous generation and Blue Valley as it exists. But I won’t hold my breath. ,Mostly, , is just aiming to be a pleasant show about a young girl trying to fit into a small town and fight against expressly evil men who want to rid the world of heroes. It’s saccharine and more than a little corny, but it’s also hollow. Superheroes are metaphors,  as big and obvious as some of them can be like, say, Captain America. And that’s the entire point: a simple mantra or belief to rally behind, something decent or true to embody in the middle of a messy world. If , has that heart, it’s taking its sweet time to show it.

28,"Disney Plus now streams The Simpsons in its proper aspect ratio, but it wasn’t easy",2020-05-28,Julia Alexander,"Earlier seasons of ,are finally available to ,, a task Disney Plus’ product team had to spend some time figuring out. ,Aspect ratios are a big deal in ,. Fox originally aired the show in 1989, and at the time used a 4:3 aspect ratio. The show, as any fan will explain, relies heavily on visual gags — an aspect of joke-telling that wouldn’t become an issue until near the end of 2009, about a third of the way through ,’ 20th season — when the show’s aspect ratio switched from 4:3 to 16:9. When Disney , to Disney Plus in November 2019, every episode was only available in 16:9, meaning older episodes looked stretched out, and jokes that relied on visual framing were effectively cut out. ,The Disney Plus product team knew they had to fix it, but it wasn’t as simple as adding old files. Disney Plus subscribers now just have to switch a toggle on ,’,description page when they open the app. Essentially, the Disney Streaming Services product team had to rethink how content was packaged for streaming purposes, one that Joe Rice, vice president of media product, called a “fundamental change” in a ,.,Prior to Disney’s team packaging both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios in one content package (a group of audiovisual components including video, audio languages, formats, and subtitles), the believed assumption was only “a single version of video would be present in any given package,” Rice wrote.,The team created multiple “facets,” which essentially created flexible combinations of audio, video, and subtitle components. As part of the fix, it doesn’t matter what chosen aspect ratio people use to watch ,, but basic features like “Continue Watching” or autoplay will continue to work. This was paramount to the team, Rice explained. Those existing features were crucial to the Disney Plus streaming experience, with Rice adding that new “4:3 versions couldn’t be treated as standalone bonus content.” ,Here’s a fun side-by-side to show the difference in how streams are now bundled. They’re packaged together, so once people toggle to select the aspect ratio they want, the version is pulled from the same package and everything reacts seamlessly. ,“To support both the original 4:3 aspect ratio and the 16:9 versions of ,, we needed to challenge prior assumptions and rethink how content for streaming is packaged and delivered,” said Rice. “We introduced a new Disney+ app feature today that not only gives fans a choice in video viewing formats, but also opens up a number of exciting opportunities for novel ways of presenting content in the future.”",earlier seasons of are finally available to a task disney plus product team had to spend some time figuring out aspect ratios are a big deal in fox originally aired the show in and at the time used a aspect ratio the show as any fan will explain relies heavily on visual gags an aspect of joke telling that wouldn t become an issue until near the end of about a third of the way through th season when the show s aspect ratio switched from to when disney to disney plus in november every episode was only available in meaning older episodes looked stretched out and jokes that relied on visual framing were effectively cut out the disney plus product team knew they had to fix it but it wasn t as simple as adding old files disney plus subscribers now just have to switch a toggle on description page when they open the app essentially the disney streaming services product team had to rethink how content was packaged for streaming purposes one that joe rice vice president of media product called a fundamental change in a prior to disney s team packaging both and aspect ratios in one content package a group of audiovisual components including video audio languages formats and subtitles the believed assumption was only a single version of video would be present in any given package rice wrote the team created multiple facets which essentially created flexible combinations of audio video and subtitle components as part of the fix it doesn t matter what chosen aspect ratio people use to watch but basic features like continue watching or autoplay will continue to work this was paramount to the team rice explained those existing features were crucial to the disney plus streaming experience with rice adding that new versions couldn t be treated as standalone bonus content here s a fun side by side to show the difference in how streams are now bundled they re packaged together so once people toggle to select the aspect ratio they want the version is pulled from the same package and everything reacts seamlessly to support both the original aspect ratio and the versions of we needed to challenge prior assumptions and rethink how content for streaming is packaged and delivered said rice we introduced a new disney app feature today that not only gives fans a choice in video viewing formats but also opens up a number of exciting opportunities for novel ways of presenting content in the future ,earlier season finally available task disney plus product team spend time figuring aspect ratio big deal fox originally aired show time used aspect ratio show fan explain relies heavily visual gag aspect joke telling become issue near end third way season show aspect ratio switched disney disney plus november every episode available meaning older episode looked stretched joke relied visual framing effectively cut disney plus product team knew fix simple adding old file disney plus subscriber switch toggle description page open app essentially disney streaming service product team rethink content packaged streaming purpose one joe rice vice president medium product called fundamental change prior disney team packaging aspect ratio one content package group audiovisual component including video audio language format subtitle believed assumption single version video would present given package rice wrote team created multiple facet essentially created flexible combination audio video subtitle component part fix matter chosen aspect ratio people use watch basic feature like continue watching autoplay continue work paramount team rice explained existing feature crucial disney plus streaming experience rice adding new version treated standalone bonus content fun side side show difference stream bundled packaged together people toggle select aspect ratio want version pulled package everything reacts seamlessly support original aspect ratio version needed challenge prior assumption rethink content streaming packaged delivered said rice introduced new disney app feature today give fan choice video viewing format also open number exciting opportunity novel way presenting content future
29,Hulu’s Ramy takes cringe comedy to a dark and funny place,2020-05-29,Joshua Rivera,"The United States is a difficult country to live in if you believe in anything. Our nation’s institutions fail us frequently and disastrously; our politics favor corporations over people; our cultural discourse is frequently weighted toward the cynical and disingenuous. Faith must be practiced, and a belief in most things — social justice, an equitable society, even the American Dream — is rarely rewarded. ,Religious faith is even harder. Any non-Christian belief is barely recognized or accommodated, and even if you fall into a form of widely accepted Christianity, its prominence in the culture is rarely felt from within, eschewed in favor of an endless war against secular culture. America is not a nation of believers, and our pop culture reflects that. In its second season, , Hulu’s award-winning comedy created by star Ramy Youssef, is about being a believer and how hard a thing that is to be in America. ,Picking up shortly after the first season finale, ,begins with Ramy Hassan (Youssef) returning from his trip to Egypt severely depressed. He had gone in the hopes of connecting with his spirituality and his family and instead ended up sleeping with his cousin. Now, he’s back home in New Jersey, and he cannot stop masturbating or eating candy — so he decides to do something about it and devotes himself to becoming a better Muslim. ,This forms the spine of ,’s second season. In his desire to be better, he leaves his mosque and pledges himself to a new spiritual leader, Sheikh Ali (Mahershala Ali) who agrees to teach him. Ramy, unfortunately, is a difficult pupil, sure he wants to do the right thing but hopelessly lost as to why. Much like in season 1, the series liberally expands its scope beyond Ramy, with episodes dedicated to his family and friends, taking every opportunity to contrast and complicate Ramy’s limited view with another perspective. In one episode, he unexpectedly runs into a former adult film star after spending several episodes getting off to porn; in another, his desire to absolve himself leads to him pushing Sheikh Ali to welcome a man he barely knows into their mosque — a vet with PTSD that ultimately results in tragedy. ,As that last part suggests, , season 2 is often a very dark show, much more so than its first, which already had plenty of bite accompanying its comedy. In diving even deeper into faith, ,, by necessity, goes long on its companion: shame. Multiple episodes have some of the most uncomfortable scenes I’ve seen on TV this year. However, the cringe comedy is also accompanied by a wonderful and warm empathy. The series presents a worldview that’s not interested in religion as a means of absolving people’s worst impulses, but as another avenue by which they can be understood. It’s a path to understand yourself and others as well as another avenue to let everyone down. In other words, it’s just a way to be human. ,In being so openly messy, , attempts to resist the urge to characterize it as , Muslim American comedy, rooting itself in a cast of characters that have experiences that can be universal to its community — most notably, islamophobia, along with a more general American hostility toward immigrants — but also with significant flaws of their own. It’s good representation without the pressure to be representative. Ramy, the character, has an anti-Semitic uncle, a mother whose ignorance results in unintentional bigotry, and a best friend with muscular dystrophy who is often incredibly selfish. But ,, the show, always takes the time to tell their unvarnished stories in a well-rounded way. It’s full of people doing things good and bad, trying to make sense of a world that is both nonsensical and often hostile toward them. ,The result is a tremendous show that is heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and wickedly funny. It holds nothing back and feels complete even as it remains resolutely open-ended. Despite the popular notion that religion is where we go to find answers, ,offers few, if any at all. Maybe the problem is that Ramy, no matter how hard he tries, doesn’t actually believe in anything yet. How could he? He was raised in America.

31,"Superstardom isn’t what it used to be, but it can still bring us together",2020-04-27,Joshua Rivera,"On April 21st, CBS aired ,, a concert special recorded to commemorate the fourth anniversary of Prince’s death. Taped on January 28th, two days after the Grammys aired, the concert is immediately notable for being a throwback to our pre-pandemic world of live (at the time) entertainment. But our current , hasn’t just given , a new layer of relevance; it also amplified its intended purpose: highlighting how there is truly no artist like Prince and precious few pop culture icons that can capture the imagination of so many.,By now, we’re used to the way pop culture has fragmented along with our interests. Brands are bigger than stars, and few franchises — most of them owned by Disney — can reliably get the vast majority of the public talking. Shared experiences aren’t really extinct. We still have big-ticket sports broadcasts like the Super Bowl, viral sensations on streaming platforms like ,, and the occasional prestige series that generates a lot of buzz (like the first season of ,). They’re just rarer. ,But with our world in lockdown, pop culture is one of the only things we have left to share with others. The mass culture of the decades prior to the 21st century doesn’t exist anymore, so instead, we’re gathering around remembrances of it: iconic sports games like ,, celebratory concerts like ,, and, in ESPN’s ,about the life of Michael Jordan., is a particularly surreal thing to watch during lockdown. The 10-part documentary follows Jordan during his 1997–98 basketball season with the Chicago Bulls, which would be his last before his second retirement from the sport and his last season with the Bulls. Throughout, the series flashes back to the beginnings of Jordan’s life and career, and then forward to recent interviews with Jordan and those who knew him or followed his remarkable hoops journey (Including “former Chicago resident” Barack Obama).,As a documentary, , is kind of perfunctory, leaning heavily on the fact that Jordan was an unparalleled superstar with a level of fame that’s hard to grasp unless you lived through it.

32,Little Fires Everywhere wants you to know it’s definitely about race,2020-03-20,Joshua Rivera,"In ,, people are constantly talking about how they would never “make something about race.” They often say it with shocked indignation — they don’t ,, how could you , that? — because they think of themselves as good people, in the way only wealthy white folks can. You know the kind of people who describe themselves as “comfortable?” , is a show about that very specific demographic, and what happens when their carefully constructed world starts to tear at the seams. People are challenged with the notion that maybe they aren’t as progressive and open-minded as they think they are. ,Hulu’s adaptation of Celeste Ng’s excellent novel is set in Shaker Heights, a real-life suburb of Cleveland. Taking place in the ‘90s, the story follows the well-to-do Richardson family, outlining the events that would lead to their house being burned down by their youngest daughter, Izzy (Megan Stott) — the event that kicks off the show. The eight episodes (the first three are out now, the rest weekly) that follow illustrate how the Richardsons got here, starting with the arrival of Mia Warren (Kerry Washington) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood), two people who get hopelessly tangled in the Richardsons’ lives, inadvertently exposing their worst traits. ,Mia, an artist, leads an itinerant life and has arrived in Shaker Heights with the hopes of giving Pearl a stability they’ve never had together. She leases an apartment from the Richardsons, and over time, she and Pearl slowly become more integrated in their daily life. Pearl attends the same school as the four Richardson children, befriending middle son Moody (Gavin Lewis) and pining after his older brother Trip (Jordan Elsass). Meanwhile, misfit Izzy begins to strike up a relationship with Mia, as Mia and Elena Richardson, the family matriarch, become increasingly wary of the influence each has on the other’s children. ,From here, , slowly starts to simmer, putting each of its cast of privileged white characters in situations that gradually escalate until they are forced to finally ditch their preferred euphemisms. Each encounter exposes another way in which they believe themselves to be good and decent because they’ve built a world where their sense of selves are not challenged. Elena’s daughter Lexie thinks herself virtuous for dating a black classmate, Brian, although she swears it doesn’t enter the equation. Elena hires Mia as her housekeeper, willfully ignorant of the race and class dynamics at play by hiring someone who pays her rent. Bill Richardson (Joshua Jackson), Elena’s husband, admonishes her for not getting a background check before offering the apartment to Mia. Elena, repeatedly, compliments herself for what a , she’s doing by helping the Warrens. ,Over and over again, the Warrens collide against the polite racism of those who pride themselves as not racist, and those small collisions slowly build to something catastrophic, as a friend of the Richardsons adopts a Chinese baby whose mother suddenly resurfaces, demanding her child back. It’s a crisis that compels the people in it to directly say what they’ve spent their lives talking around, and the results are not pretty.,While , has its sights set squarely on being a withering takedown of petty suburban class dynamics, it’s also remarkably understanding of the people within it. While its heart lies with the Warrens, every major player is considerably complicated. Elena Richardson is perfectly played by Reese Witherspoon — every passive-aggressive action cheerily delivered, and every boundary violation couched in the language of good intentions. As deft as the characterization is, the series is also interested in the forces that produce it — how a woman’s ambitions are stifled by societal pressures, and how she ultimately can end up reinforcing the boundaries that initially penned her in. ,That depth extends in every direction — Mia, as played by Kerry Washington, is a quiet force of nature, slowly realizing that she has just enough leverage to upend the neatly ordered worlds of the people who don’t know how much power they indiscriminately wield. As her past becomes less of a mystery, viewers begin to understand why she would apply that pressure. Through Pearl, Mia’s heartbreak is felt when the fault lines that she sees are clearly exposed for the first time. Through each of the Richardson children, the costs of perpetuating the life their parents made for them begin to manifest in unexpected ways. ,This is what , most clearly conveys: there are no easy answers, but there are people who benefit from the questions that go unasked. And when things get hard, there will always be people who have the option to make good choices and those who do not. Most times, the world counts on these questions going unasked, under the guise of manners.

33,How to stream HBO Max ,2020-05-27,Chaim Gartenberg,". Combining the vast content empire of AT&T’s WarnerMedia — HBO, Warner Bros., New Line Cinema, DC Entertainment, TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network, The CW, Crunchyroll, and Adult Swim — into a single streaming service already gives HBO Max one of the broadest streaming catalogs around. ,Additional licensed content, including the works of Studio Ghibli, titles from the Criterion Collection, shows from the BBC, and popular series like , and ,, make it one of the most high-profile streaming services yet. And that’s in addition to original shows and movies that will be exclusive to HBO Max. ,But HBO Max is also one of the most expensive streaming services around, costing $14.99 per month — vastly more than Netflix, Hulu, or Disney Plus. ,Interested in trying it out? Here’s everything you need to know about getting started with HBO Max,HBO Max costs $14.99 a month, making it one of the most expensive streaming services around. That price is the same monthly cost as HBO Now, however — and HBO Max offers all the content that had been available on HBO Now, plus all that WarnerMedia stuff.,There’s also a free seven-day trial for anyone looking to give it a shot before they pay up, along with plans for a , of HBO Max set to launch sometime in 2021. ,WarnerMedia’s streaming options have grown… complicated, to say the least, with the addition of HBO Max. Here’s how things break down across all the various services:,This is where things start to get a little tricky. Depending on where you get your current HBO or HBO Now subscription — or which AT&T cellphone plan you have — you might already be getting free HBO Max. ,: If you subscribe to HBO through a cable or internet TV provider, there’s a very good chance that you’ll have access to HBO Max already. Major providers like AT&T TV, Cox, DirecTV, Hulu, Optimum, Spectrum, Verizon Fios, and Comcast Xfinity are all supporting HBO Max — if you already have HBO through one of those providers, you should be able to log in using your usual credentials. ,. ,: If you pay for HBO Now through HBO Now directly or through Apple, Google Play, Samsung, Optimum, Verizon Fios, Consolidated Communications, or Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico, then your account will be converted to an HBO Max account.,Some of AT&T’s wireless, internet, and TV plans ,, including AT&T’s Unlimited Elite wireless plan and AT&T Fiber’s 1 Gig plan.,If you pay for HBO Now through another provider, though — like, say, Amazon — then you won’t have access to HBO Max, even if you log in on another, non-Amazon device. If that’s the case, you’ll have to wait until WarnerMedia works out a deal with your provider or switch your HBO Now subscription over to a different company (or just subscribe directly through WarnerMedia).,HBO Max includes HBO’s entire content library, including shows like ,, ,, ,, and more. But that’s just the start: it’ll also include a huge amount of classic and modern Warner Bros. films, like the , series, DC’s superhero movies (including the upcoming Zack Snyder cut of , planned for 2021), and the entire Studio Ghibli catalog (except , for some reason). Major popular TV series, like ,, ,, and ,, will also be available. ,But like all major streaming services, HBO Max will also have exclusive content that won’t be available anywhere else, including , (out now), the forthcoming , (a spinoff from the popular animated series), and ,. HBO Max also has numerous original shows and movies in production for the future, including a , reboot, ,, a Green Lantern series, ,, ,, ,. ,Right now, HBO Max is only available in the United States at launch, but WarnerMedia is looking to expand the service internationally — including Latin America and Europe — in the future. ,HBO Max is available on Android, Android TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, iOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Samsung smart TV platforms (from 2016 and onward — in fact, the “new” app is actually just an update to the existing HBO Now apps on those platforms). There’s also a desktop web player for streaming on Mac, Windows, and Chromebook devices. ,Notably missing from that list: Amazon’s Fire TV and Roku, neither of which can access HBO Max. (Both platforms do offer HBO Now apps, but they haven’t been updated to HBO Max and can’t access the additional content).,HBO Max can be streamed on up to three different devices simultaneously, so you can share an account with friends and family members. The service also allows for multiple user profiles to be created, with options for parentally controlled “Kid” profiles on which parents can set content ratings limits. ,HBO Max content can be downloaded locally, but there are a few limitations: users get a total of 30 downloads per account across all devices and user profiles. Unwatched downloads also expire after 30 days or after 48 hours once you’ve started watching it. Users will be able to renew expired downloads, although it’s not clear if there’s a limit as to how often you’ll be able to do so. Additionally, only five copies of a show or movie can be downloaded at once across your various devices. ,HBO Max also offers two different download options: “highest quality,” a larger file that will take longer to download, and a “fastest download” option that offers a smaller file that will download faster. ,HBO Max can be signed up for in a variety of ways: customers can go to HBO Max’s website and subscribe , or purchase a subscription through a supported TV or internet service (,).

Some of the answers are good; some of them less so. ,In its third season premiere, the show does very little to catch new viewers up to speed, so here are the broad strokes: Westworld, the show’s eponymous park, is one of several theme parks where astonishingly lifelike robots populate re-creations of various historical periods. For a very large price, the wealthy can come and roleplay the fantasy of their choice for a spell, tourists for whom morality is completely optional and hedonism is encouraged — because, after all, the robots (called “hosts” here) aren’t real people. ,Season 1 was about complicating that, as the hosts of Westworld developed consciousness and became aware of the atrocities their creators forced them to live through over and over again. Season 2 was about revolution, as the hosts began to fight back and tear down the park around them. Throughout both, there are running threads tied to the elite who run and attend the park. This mostly related to an internal power struggle within Delos (the corporation that owns Westworld and its sister parks) and teasing that the actual purpose of Westworld is not entertainment but data: a perfect psychological profile of all the elite guests who visit it, built using their unfettered behavior in the parks. ,Unfortunately, this summary (and any summary, really) leaves out , by necessity because , is perhaps the most over-plotted show on television, obsessed with nonlinear storytelling, symbology, constant references to literature and philosophy, and regular plot twists or status quo shifts. It would be nice if the third season was a clean break that let viewers ignore it completely because catching up is exhausting. To a certain extent, you can! But as things begin to unfold, you’re probably going to need to open a wiki. ,The show’s third season begins with Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), the Westworld host who began the robot revolution, out in the real world and eager to enact revenge on her creators. From the four episodes provided to critics in advance, this seems to be the glue holding the season together: what does Dolores’ revenge look like? Which other hosts are out in the real world now? Who are her targets and why? It’s easy enough stuff, and it’s compelling to watch, too. While the show is named after a theme park that made for a fun setting, , slowly began to flesh out what the real world looked like and exploring that world is the best part of these early episodes. ,A big reason for this is that our guide to this world isn’t Dolores but Caleb (Aaron Paul), a disillusioned construction worker and veteran. He’s forced to pick up gig work via an app best described as “Taskrabbit but for crimes” in order to pay for his mother’s hospital bills. Through Caleb, we see this gilded cyberpunk world through working-class eyes, and few eyes are as good at charismatically conveying constant internal suffering than Paul’s. ,Things get more unwieldy as the show sprawls outward from there, catching the viewers up on who survived the massacre at the conclusion of last season and what their status is. The show does this at a languid, perplexing pace, sometimes grabbing your attention with an alarming twist, and in others, it falls back on its cryptic ways. There is, however, a glimmer of hope: by the end of the fourth episode, these seemingly disparate threads come together. The show seems to have a sense of purpose it has not had since its pilot. ,Early in its run, ,invited a lot of comparisons to video games. It made sense on multiple levels: the show was about a park that adhered to a game-like narrative design, and  it cared about detailing the push and pull between the desires of players, designers, and the emergent behavior of the system itself. Pull the lens back more, the way , season 3 does, and the metaphor continues to work astonishingly well. The games built by the characters of , are, like many of the biggest video games, power fantasies. Crucially, they’re power fantasies that map onto the inequality of the world: where labor is not valued, laborers are barely treated as human, and the innovations of science and technology disproportionately benefit the wealthy. ,But as Dolores notes at one point, these are all the products of systems, and systems are more fragile than the people who made them think. It’s a turn that has taken on a strange prescience given the rapidly changing state of the world due to a pandemic, shocks to said systems have a way of exposing just how much inequity is wholly unnecessary, perpetuated simply because there are profits to be made in sustaining it. To refer back to ,’s favorite paraphrasing of Shakespeare: violent delights have violent ends.

36,Which FX shows should you stream on Hulu?,2020-03-19,Joshua Rivera,"This month, , added nearly the entire library of FX television shows as a result of Disney’s recent acquisition of Fox. And aside from some uncomfortable corporate consolidation undertones, it’s a boon to everyone who is ,. ,Think of FX like a basic cable HBO — a network that consistently churns out damn good television. It’s hard to go wrong with a lineup so consistently good, but here are a few favorites. ,follows Sam Fox, a middle-aged actress and single mother to three kids. The list of reasons to appreciate the show is long: it’s one of the warmest you can watch, full of love and empathy for nearly every person on-screen. It’s very funny, with cold opens that often leave you laughing within 30 seconds. And it’s completely beholden to its own interests, with each episode being an entirely different, lovely experience. Currently in the middle of its fourth season, , is a fantastic showcase for co-creator and star Pamela Adlon, who faced the unenviable task of contending with co-creator Louis C.K.’s admission of sexual misconduct between the show’s second and third seasons. Somehow, Adlon didn’t just weather the storm but she made a good thing even better. ,This is just... the coolest show. Distilled cool. One-hundred-proof slick. The story of Raylan Givens (devilishly handsome Timothy Olyphant), a US Marshal reassigned to his Kentucky hometown after his Wild West attitude gets him in hot water, , starts simply enough. Each episode features Givens on a new case, giving it a nice episodic feel while ongoing conflicts simmer in the background, eventually building to long-game payoffs. It’s a tremendously good binge, stylish from beginning to end. , has a quick hook: Earn Marks (Donald Glover) wants to prove to the mother of his daughter that he’s worth something, so he convinces his cousin, up-and-coming rapper Al “Paper Boi” Marks (Brian Tyree Henry) to let him be his manager. The show almost immediately abandons this premise in favor of surreal standalone episodes with only the smallest hints of continuity between them. In ,, creator Donald Glover and his collaborators have crafted a vehicle where anything can happen, and they can do whatever they want, from “Teddy Perkins,” an astonishing and unsettling episode about a Michael Jackson analog to an episode about a party Drake throws where Drake never appears.

As a choreographer and director, the former was known for changing Broadway forever behind the scenes, and as a dancer and actor, the latter was the face of that change. The reality of their dynamic was more complicated and involved than that, and while , is a bit shy when it comes to showing the fruits of their relationship — dancing, mostly— the series is a soulful, compelling look at two titans of show business struggling to hold their lives together when they weren’t putting on a show. ,One of the greatest missed opportunities in television, ,is a dramedy about two pals, Hank Dolworth and Britt Pollack, who work together as unlicensed private detectives in a San Diego beach town.

The program allows a company to use its own payment methods, Gurman says, and it’s already in use by apps from more niche premium video providers like Altice One and Canal+. ,Gurman, in a , published

40,Tiger King is a show about how the internet eats us all,2020-04-01,Joshua Rivera," is one of the strongest contenders for most watchable TV show of the year, and it’s a problem. A documentary miniseries comprising seven quick episodes, each under an hour, you could watch the whole thing in a weekend; given the subject, you’ll probably finish even faster. ,The Netflix series follows a man both larger than life and smothered by it: Joe Exotic, the one-time owner of a successful-seeming private zoo with over 200 tigers and other big cats. He’s a man who ran for president of the United States, then governor of Oklahoma, and then sometime after, may have tried to hire someone to kill his nemesis, a woman dedicated to shutting his zoo down. It’s incredibly compelling, and terribly so: ,is almost wholly dedicated to spectacle, with little interest in any sense of truth. And the truth is about as gutting as , is sensational.,As the eponymous Tiger King, Joe Exotic is magnetic: a ball-capped, mulleted man who swaggers with a knee brace and a drawl, wearing some combination of fringe vests, chaps, and bedazzled shirts at all times. You’ve never seen anyone on television like him. Born Joe Schreibvogel, the man’s eccentricities are accompanied by a tragic backstory that ,will deliver piecemeal and in passing. For the first few episodes, we meet him more or less fully formed: a man who has built a small empire with his larger-than-life personality and his equally large cats — an empire that, somehow, crumbled and landed him in prison. ,Every minute of , yields some new surprise, an unbelievable turn or charismatic stranger with incredible stories to tell. The documentary plays fast and loose with these anecdotes, as Joe Exotic shows us how he married two men at once, went into business with a guy who snuck tiger cubs into Vegas casinos, or nearly got mauled by one of his own lions. With no warning, the show also veers into immensely dark territory, as its subjects recount manipulative and abusive relationships, a death by suicide, and Joe Exotic’s sustained hate campaign against Carole Baskin, an activist committed to ending big cat ownership in America whom Joe Exotic also believes killed her wealthy husband for money.,As , goes on, its greatest strength — the litany of unbelievable stories it has to share — becomes its most concerning weakness, as the filmmakers don’t really seem to be interested in telling a story about its subjects as they are in milking them dry. There’s little point to , beyond its sensational thrills and credulously presenting everyone it puts in front of a camera. The show does not, for example, present any context for how seriously you should take the allegation that Carole Baskin killed her husband — so now this allegation is fodder for viral tweets, , for the , , that happens to have real-world fallout: new leads in case of Baskin’s missing ex-husband are being ,. ,It’s likely that you will watch , and wonder if there’s more to the story, and you’d be right. A cursory search for facts will likely lead to , feature about the tangled histories of Schreibvogel and Baskin, reconstructing their early lives and detailing their rivalry. Laid out in print, the story is far more sobering than the occasional flashes of somber distress we get on the show. Both Schreibvogel and Baskin are reportedly victims of abuse, dogged by misfortune and embraced by strange circumstances. Truth is elusive in both of their lives; Schreibvogel appears to be a serial fabulist, and Baskin’s public persona has a singular focus, with few public associations beyond the cats she keeps on her preserve. In their orbits, lives are destroyed — the overwhelming number of them sacrifices dedicated to the myth of the Tiger King.,There’s a level of complicity to viral fame that’s hard to square with shows like ,. In the streaming era, interest is often the result of direct action. There’s very little passivity left in how we entertain ourselves. We choose what to watch, what to recommend, and who to listen to, so if something like , is a viral hit, it , organic, like something we’re all talking about because we’re genuinely interested in it. ,Because of this, , becomes content that generates , content on websites and social media, which, in turn, leads more people back to ,. This, then, eventually leads to the extremely online becoming amateur sleuths and flooding Florida tip lines about a decades-old murder case. Through this cycle, suffering becomes sport — something that can be said of a lot of true-crime media — but also a call to action. ,It can be seen in the way the , encourages listeners to adopt a vindictive view of the role of law enforcement or in the entire cottage industry spun out of ,’s first season, which birthed an entertainment empire around the guilt or innocence of Adnan Syed. It’s a phenomenon fueled by our need to seek resolution where there often is none to be found. In the absence of finality, we post into the infinite. The tyranny of the internet bleeds into the real world: if there’s enough content, eventually, that content becomes real life. We are consumed by the tiger king.

41,"New trailers: Snowpiercer, Normal People, The Innocence Files, and more",2020-04-04,Jacob Kastrenakes,"One of the few small upsides to the current global mess is that a bunch of movies are hitting streaming services and rental platforms earlier than they otherwise would have: ,, ,, and , are on that list, among many others. ,Another that’s now streaming early on Hulu is ,, which I caught last weekend. It’s a wonderful movie about two women slowly growing closer together over the course of about a week that they’re forced to spend together.,The movie revolves around painting, as the title suggests, but the film also does some really fascinating things with music. There are three moments in the movie where music plays, and in all three cases, you don’t see its origin (a piano, singers, an orchestra) until well after the music begins, if at all. It creates a very strange, untethered feeling. Is this sound really happening, or is it part of the score? There’s tension to simply figuring it out, and it adds an important, off-kilter element to a few particularly crucial scenes.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,TNT is turning , into a TV series, and so far it looks like it’ll be every bit as vibrant and violent as the movie adaptation. I’m hopeful it can take things even further, too — the movie speeds through so much of the train’s ritzier cars, leaving plenty more of this extravagant and divided world for the show to explore. The show debuts May 17th.,Hulu has an adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel , coming up.

42,The Office celebrates a work life that doesn’t exist anymore,2020-04-07,Julia Alexander,"The scenes that make ,special aren’t overly zany but are extremely relatable, like Dwight Schrute making an obnoxious sales call at his desk, while Jim and Pam roll their eyes at their colleague’s behavior. It happens almost every episode: two people, the stand-ins for the audience, acknowledging just how annoying the workplace is. ,is a show about the random, boring bits of everyday work life and the comedy that ensues from being surrounded by the same people on a daily basis. Employees sit at their desks, jokes are made, and snacks are munched on. Fifteen years later, it’s still one of the most enduring sitcoms because ,is an extraordinarily ordinary depiction of modern working life in America — well, it was. ,How jobs look has shifted radically over the last decade. The coronavirus pandemic simply sped up the circumstances for many industries. The gig economy is one of the biggest notable transitions. Uber, Lyft, Fiverr, Amazon Flex, and Airbnb didn’t exist 15 years ago when , premiered. Now, there are more than 55 million gig economy workers in the United States, , That’s more than 55 million people who don’t go into an office every day and share a kitchen with co-workers. Their idea of day-to-day work is already different from what ,presented. ,Before the pandemic forced us inside, ,was relatable. How does a workplace comedy operate without a workplace? Today, it feels like a piece of popular culture from eras past. Social distancing measures mean more people are working from home. Gags have shifted from pranking your deskmate to creating weird glitch art on Zoom using random anime backgrounds; hijinks in the shared kitchen turned into creating new Slack emoji to deliver a joke faster. ,Even those who aren’t in gig economy jobs are facing a time when physical offices aren’t necessary for most companies. Instant communication tools like Slack make talking with co-workers possible from anywhere, remote work is easy to do with an assortment of productivity services. Michael Scott’s outbursts in ,don’t transition well to Slack, where the equivalent is a message typed out in all-caps. That’s not as funny. ,Videoconferencing has also never been easier. Services like Zoom allow remote workers to talk face-to-face, all from the safety and comfort of their own homes. In December 2019, Zoom saw heights of 10 million daily users — by March 2020, Zoom was hitting “more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid,” ,“We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. ,Companies have transitioned quickly from operating in physical spaces to moving everything online. Zoom is hitting record-breaking numbers, as is Microsoft Teams, a group chat and collaboration tool from Microsoft that rivals Slack. Slack is no different. CEO Stewart Butterfield shared numbers in a lengthy tweet thread, noting that on Tuesday, March 10th, Slack’s concurrent users passed 10 million. That number jumped to 10.5 million just six days later, reaching 12.5 million on March 25th. ,“We have an incredible business that has been growing very quickly and that will continue to do so for many, many years to come,” Butterfield told Slack employees, as seen in ,. “We provide a platform that is going to become even more useful to the world in the years to come.” ,This pandemic will forever change parts of our lives, much like the 1918 influenza did more than 100 years ago. A big part of that will be the physicality of work. “The age of the office as we know it is probably over, and the bell can’t be unrung,” Matt Burr, CEO at Nomadic Learning, ,. More employees, once ready to commute into an office every day, will use tools like Slack and Zoom to work from home more often, according to Burr. Companies will see less of a reason to have physical space and will use remote advantages to build teams in different cities. ,Work has changed, and television will follow. Pop culture has always reflected our lives at a certain moment in time. Similar to how we revisit ,or ,to scratch the nostalgic itch for times when families were corny and homely or marathoning shows like ,and ,to reminisce about a time when people actually hung out, ,yearns for simpler times. Actress Angela Kinsey (who played Angela Martin on the show) described the series as inexplicably comforting. That comfort comes from the normalcy of a work routine — something I’ve come to miss in the weeks I’ve been at home. ,Less than 20 years ago, people worked in offices. Now, many of us work from home. Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein, co-producers on ,, are developing a new workplace comedy, but this one won’t include characters like Dwight and Jim throwing pencils at each other over their computers. Instead, the show is about a “wunderkind boss who, in an effort to ensure his staff’s connectedness and productivity, asks them all to virtually interact and work face-to-face all day,” , ,We’ve walked toward this change in work culture for years, but now it’s here for millions of people. The pandemic didn’t suddenly flip a switch; it proved that people can — and will — work without an office. Last year, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 26 million Americans, or approximately 16 percent of the total workforce, work from home. Imagine if half of ,’s cast suddenly stopped showing up because they could conduct calls at home and check in with co-workers online. Between 2005 and 2015, employees who telecommuted rose by 115 percent, the bureau reported.,Those years also happen to represent ,s run. As ,went off the air, so did the idea that day-to-day work would look the same as it did in 2005. More than 55 million people are gig workers who don’t have offices to go to, more people are set to work from home than ever, and an entire generation of employees may not experience that type of work setting — one considered universal less than 20 years ago. That’s the future pop culture will incorporate. There’s something poetic about ,’s co-producers being some of the first to try. ,“Start with the office comedy, lose the office and you’re just left with comedy,” co-producer Lieberstein told ,. “The math works.” ,In the meantime, many of us are at home, so lonely that we are wistfully streaming old episodes of ,, longing for the Dwight Schrutes in our lives, wishing they could do something

It can provide an escape for people trying to forget reality, and it can create a sense of community. Much of the time, that community is borne out of live TV.

45,Tales from the Loop turns small-town America into a sci-fi feelings machine,2020-04-06,Joshua Rivera,"is so pretty it breaks your heart. Based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, famous for his scenes of pastoral tranquility draped around uncanny sci-fi sights, ,’s newest drama is a collection of eight short stories where everyday rural life is tinged with the supernatural. But unlike, say, ,, where the otherworldly takes center stage, , uses it as an excuse to dig deeper into the people who must continue to live mundane lives, even as the extraordinary looms just inches away. ,While , features a recurring cast of characters and overlapping plots, each episode functions as a standalone short story. Since critics were sent three out-of-order episodes for review, it’s safe to assume that continuity isn’t really a concern for the show; just consider it , with every episode set in the same town. ,And what a town it is! The series takes place in a fictional Ohio neighborhood built above The Loop, a machine built to “explore the mysteries of the universe.” The Loop is massive, and, while it employs most of the residents who live above it, few know the full extent of what goes on within its confines. All they know is that the work done there has changed the texture of their lives. Some of these changes are overt and intentional, like advances in technology that make robotic limbs, hovering tractors, and walking mechs commonplace. ,Other phenomena are less intentional: strange, inexplicable sightings; objects that appear out of thin air; fluctuations in space and time. In the ecosystem of this small Midwestern town, The Loop is an invasive exotic, reshaping the balance of life and nature around it. And everyone there has to just roll with it because they have no choice. Besides, sometimes The Loop has its benefits. ,In the episodes provided in advance, a girl’s mother disappears and leaves behind a strange artifact in “Loop,” a boy hears voices coming from a strange globe in “Echo Sphere,” and in “Parallel,” a man stumbles into another universe. What follows each is a tender drama that feels like a play, each devoted mostly to loneliness. ,Each character, at least in the episodes screened, yearns for connection. While “Loop” is set in motion by a disappearance, it’s really about distance, as the girl’s search for her missing parent serves as a window into how they became strangers to each other. “Parallel” shows a man meeting himself in another universe, but it chooses character drama over genre thrills as the two versions of the same man attempt to befriend one another. Over and over, , gestures at some inarticulate sadness and shows its characters trying to work through it. ,It’s not that big of a stretch from Stålenhag’s art, which is overwhelmingly melancholic in the way it juxtaposes the mundane and the fantastic. Transposed from its original Swedish context to an American one, that sorrow takes on new wrinkles. The Loop puts boundless potential literally within arm’s length of small-town Ohio, and yet, its denizens lead more or less the same lives they’d live without it. People still work in what seem like dead-end jobs, they have trouble tilling their fields, they don’t see their families enough. Through the eyes of a set of acclaimed directors — Ti West, Charlie McDowell, So Yong Kim, and Mark Romanek each helm an episode — every moment feels delicate and human, and despair never overwhelms wonder. ,is an understated work in a time when more muted stories are easily swallowed up in the wealth of available options. It’s worth making the time for, though. These are slow stories about how technology was never going to fix us no matter how promising it seems. We still have to go the slow route and try to fill the void in ourselves by reaching out to others.

46,"Quibi’s shows are fun, familiar, and a little forgettable",2020-04-06,Joshua Rivera,"It’s far too easy to make fun of Quibi. That’s the first problem. You can start with the name: an overly cute mashup of “quick bites.” It’s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to — hence a bizarre , dedicated to explaining it. It’s Netflix, but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt, yet brief enough that you wouldn’t turn to anything but your phone. You know: waiting in lines, pausing to sip a coffee, sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something. That’s Quibi’s second problem: it was created for a world that doesn’t really exist anymore, one put on hold by a pandemic. ,This makes Quibi a harder sell. TV to watch while you’re doing something else doesn’t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on. However, the contrary can , be true: we’re all staring at our phones anyway, so what’s another reason to do it some more? As of today, there are 24 reasons, each Quibi show delivered in installments of 10 minutes or less, each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream. There are 72 snacks in search of a meal.,The content — normally a crass word for art but an apt one for Quibi — runs the gamut, with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven’t really seen before. There’s a , revival starring Chance the Rapper, a series called , where Offset is really into cars and car stunts, a remake of ,starring Liam Hemsworth, and ,, a truly bizarre show where Will Arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the YouTube clip yourself. ,(,The Verg,Polygon,Verge,.),Quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone; almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations. I checked this, incessantly, with every show I watched. There’s something mind-boggling about it, the way Quibi tries to have things literally both ways. It works well enough, but there are strange side effects. In scripted shows, the dual-composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time, and that can make a serious drama feel shallow. In unscripted shows, this adds a layer of uncanniness, as slick network production clashes with a visual composition that’s thoroughly associated with influencers and lo-fi meme makers. You can, ironically, gauge how good a Quibi show is by how well it plays in vertical orientation. ,The majority of Quibi’s programming is the sort of stuff you can find on regular TV, just broken up into smaller pieces. , is a reality show in the vein of , in seven-minute chunks. , , feels like a USA drama, delivered one plot development at a time. , actually , a TV show long before Quibi, but someone figured it might play better if you didn’t have to spend 30 minutes with it. (They were right.) ,Quibi’s best shows are the ones that feel most like they could only happen on Quibi. There’s not a lot of that in the launch lineup, but perhaps the best example is ,, a ,-style courtroom show in which Chrissy Teigen is a courtroom judge mediating exclusively petty disputes, like who got someone a better Lizzo-themed sweater. It’s the perfect Quibi show — like a TikTok that got a little out of hand, but it ends just before it stops being funny. ,Another, ,, features comedians Matt Rogers and Dave Mizzoni as hosts in a competition. In every episode, two different straight men will compete to see who is the better queer ally. Again, it’s a bit that’s perfectly pitched for the platform. It’s savvy and effective, with stunts loud enough to hold your attention and talent deft enough to keep it. (It also might be the most genuinely funny show on Quibi so far.),Documentaries also fare pretty well on Quibi. The standout is ,, about LeBron James’ I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, which serves at-risk children with an approach that’s equal parts social work and education. Compelling, frank, and moving, each eight-minute installment absolutely flies by. ,Still, there’s a frivolousness to Quibi that none of its programming can seem to shake because the platform was built for frivolity. I could put on a Quibi show and keep up with it just fine while writing a grocery list, chopping garlic, or brushing my teeth and only glancing at it. Once, I almost put on a Quibi show while watching something else on my TV. ,For this reason, Quibi’s best point of comparison is podcasts, not streaming TV. It’s a medium for filling space that you probably already had filled with something else, but for some reason, you got it in your head that you should be , something in that time. It exists in a nebulous space between the steady dopamine rush of TikTok’s constant supply of novelty and the chill, lackadaisical time-sink of Twitch. Boredom is the constant, and it’s most often resolved by habit. This then, is the platform’s biggest ask: can you change your habits to accommodate it?,Because Quibi is designed to be habitual. New episodes are scheduled to drop every day, and new shows will premiere “every single Monday,” per Quibi. It’s a steady stream of quick bites coming from an endless bag of treats. Even in a world shut down by circumstance, Quibi is an interesting idea, one that wants us to use our phones the way we already do, like fidget spinners with Wi-Fi or a smoke break we can take anywhere. But that’s the third problem: no one remembers a snack. They remember a really good dinner. ",it s far too easy to make fun of quibi that s the first problem you can start with the name an overly cute mashup of quick bites it s easy to say but difficult to attach meaning to hence a bizarre dedicated to explaining it it s netflix but only for your phone and mostly for those idle moments that are long enough to be felt yet brief enough that you wouldn t turn to anything but your phone you know waiting in lines pausing to sip a coffee sitting in a car while someone runs into a store to grab something that s quibi s second problem it was created for a world that doesn t really exist anymore one put on hold by a pandemic this makes quibi a harder sell tv to watch while you re doing something else doesn t seem very appealing when no one really has anything going on however the contrary can be true we re all staring at our phones anyway so what s another reason to do it some more as of today there are reasons each quibi show delivered in installments of minutes or less each launch show with the first three episodes ready to stream there are snacks in search of a meal the content normally a crass word for art but an apt one for quibi runs the gamut with no real ethos beyond putting recognizable faces in front of consumers in a way many haven t really seen before there s a revival starring chance the rapper a series called where offset is really into cars and car stunts a remake of starring liam hemsworth and a truly bizarre show where will arnett stands in a studio and tells you about cringey moments in pop culture in less time than it takes to watch the youtube clip yourself the verg polygon verge quibi shows are designed to play equally well no matter how you hold your phone almost every one is shot in a way that works in both landscape and vertical orientations i checked this incessantly with every show i watched there s something mind boggling about it the way quibi tries to have things literally both ways it works well enough but there are strange side effects in scripted shows the dual composition means there can only really be one important thing in a shot at a time and that can make a serious drama feel shallow in unscripted shows

Zoom became a cast member in its own right as the ,team worked remotely to put together a 90-minute show for Saturday night.

51,"The Good Fight can and will do anything to get your attention, and it’s damn good at it",2020-04-10,Joshua Rivera,"One of the benefits of having a TV show on a streaming platform is something few actually take advantage of: you can more or less do anything. Freed from the shackles of broadcast ratings, once a streaming show is greenlit for a season, it’s basically guaranteed that season. ,, a legal drama on CBS All Access, has spent three years playing by no rules other than its own, upending everything you might expect from a legal drama to become one of the most slept-on shows out there. Its season 4 premiere, out this week, is the series at its most absurd and most incisive. ,To understand ,’s audacity, you have to know where it comes from. The first episode of , began with the Trump presidency. The show, a legal drama spun out of , (you don’t really need to watch that to enjoy this one) leaned into this. Its first scene featured protagonist Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a wealthy, successful lawyer, watching the inauguration and swearing. Then, she makes plans: she quits her job and makes preparations to run off to Italy, where she can ignore the looming political carnival. Things don’t go as planned, and she’s stuck here with the rest of us — her money gone, her former firm shutting her out, and her old way of life upended. ,She’s hired by a law firm owned by black partners, and , turns its premise on its head. Instead of being a story about a wealthy white woman dealing with Trump’s America, it’s about her confronting just how different that America is — and always was — for people of color. ,Perhaps that makes the series sound didactic, like it’s serving civic vegetables. And while it’s cathartic to see the writers handle topical issues like ICE’s lack of accountability or the consequences of a record number of barely qualified judges being approved by Congress, , is also unbelievably ,. Like any good courtroom drama, its cases are full of moves and countermoves that make each episode feel like a dance, and it’s frequently laugh-out-loud funny. One of the most memorable characters is Roland Blum (Michael Sheen), and amoral, fentanyl-sucking sleaze who blows through the show’s universe like a dirtbag hurricane that feels too cartoonish to be true.

",one of the benefits of having a tv show on a streaming platform is something few actually take advantage of you can more or less do anything freed from the shackles of broadcast ratings once a streaming show is greenlit for a season it s basically guaranteed that season a legal drama on cbs all access has spent three years playing by no rules other than its own upending everything you might expect from a legal drama to become one of the most slept on shows out there its season premiere out this week is the series at its most absurd and most incisive to understand s audacity you have to know where it comes from the first episode of began with the trump presidency the show a legal drama spun out of you don t really need to watch that to enjoy this one leaned into this its first scene featured protagonist diane lockhart christine baranski a wealthy successful lawyer watching the inauguration and swearing then she makes plans she quits her job and makes preparations to run off to italy where she can ignore the looming political carnival things don t go as planned and she s stuck here with the rest of us her money gone her former firm shutting her out and her old way of life upended she s hired by a law firm owned by black partners and turns its premise on its head instead of being a story about a wealthy white woman dealing with trump s america it s about her confronting just how different that america is and always was for people of color perhaps that makes the series sound didactic like it s serving civic vegetables and while it s cathartic to see the writers handle topical issues like ice s lack of accountability or the consequences of a record number of barely qualified judges being approved by congress is also unbelievably like any good courtroom drama its cases are full of moves and countermoves that make each episode feel like a dance and it s frequently laugh out loud funny one of the most memorable characters is roland blum michael sheen and amoral fentanyl sucking sleaze who blows through the show s universe like a dirtbag hurricane that feels too cartoonish to be true then you notice he appears in an episode called the one inspired by roy cohn

52,What We Do in the Shadows is a vampire comedy about being stuck at home,2020-04-20,Joshua Rivera,"There’s something soothing about watching a bunch of vampires be absolute morons on television every week.

And yet, the bloodsucking clowns of , are so very bad at being immortal monsters, which means they are excellent at comedy. ,FX’s TV series, based on the Taika Waititi film of the same name, returned for a second season just as funny as ever. Like the movie, the show follows a trio of vampires — this time, they live on Staten Island as opposed to the New Zealand of the films — living together in a derelict old manor. Nandor (Kayvan Novak), Laszlo (Matt Berry), and Nadja (Natasia Demetriou) are hundreds of years old and also total dorks. They’re bad at most things they do, but as long as they don’t accidentally stumble into sunlight or fall on a wooden stake, they’ll get over it. (It turns out, vampirism is a very potent form of failing upward.),While this is extremely similar to the movie it’s based on, the TV version of , fleshes out its mockumentary antics with a few additions to the formula: namely, a familiar, Guillermo (Harvey Guillén) who serves them in hopes of becoming a vampire, and Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch), an “energy vampire” who looks normal but feeds off the ambient misery of everyone around him. ,Colin and Guillermo are the reason , works as a show, two regular-looking dudes juxtaposed against their goth reality show roommates that also have their own normcore sociopathic tendencies. Colin, in particular, gives the show a feeling very similar to ,As an energy vampire, he feeds off everyone’s annoyance and goes out of his way to be obnoxiously corny and irritating. (One very good Colin bit involves him incessantly saying “updog” as if it were a joke no one had ever heard before.),Like the best work of show creator Jemaine Clement (who co-wrote the film with Waititi), there’s a lot of fun to be had with taking the iconography of the occult and supernatural and putting them in front of the mundanity of the mockumentary. What happens when they’re haunted by a very petty ghost? Or deal with animal control when it captures one of them in bat form? Or accidentally get a pet zombie? ,Watching , is oddly cathartic while social distancing. Maybe it’s because the vampires of the show are also isolated in a fashion, unable to see the sunlight and absolutely kooky as a result.

55,Mrs. America shows why the implosion of the Equal Rights Amendment still haunts us today  ,2020-04-17,Joshua Rivera,"In American politics, the Equal Rights Amendment is among one of the quieter embarrassments in United States history, a proposed legislation that, incredibly, has never been passed. Asserting that equality under the law not be denied on the basis of sex, the ERA has spent nearly 100 years in limbo. First introduced by activists in 1921, nearly passing in the 1970s, and finding ,, the struggle over the amendment slowly became a long-simmering culture war that remains unfortunately relevant.,, the new FX series streaming exclusively on Hulu, is the story of why it fell apart and the woman who made it happen. A nine-episode limited series, the show largely follows Phyllis Schlafly, the notorious conservative activist who discovered her calling in founding the STOP ERA movement and whose rhetoric helped successfully brand feminism with the cartoonishly angry stereotype that persists to this day. ,In the series, Schlafly, who died in 2016 (after publishing a book in support of Donald Trump), is a master of spin. Early in the show, ,illustrates how STOP ERA began to gain traction when the group started to sway politicians with bread and pies. Baked goods weren’t the only trick in STOP ERA’s arsenal, however. With Schlafly at the lead, the group argued that the ERA would rescind what they said were freedoms and protections for women under the current law: the freedom to be a housewife and raise children unconcerned with the stress of breadwinning, or the assurance that women wouldn’t or shouldn’t be drafted for the armed services. ,Portrayed by Cate Blanchett in a performance that’s a guaranteed Emmy nomination, Schlafly is the center of the story, but hers isn’t the only one ,is telling. The series also delves into the women’s movement opposite Schlafly, the leaders of which would form the National Women’s Political Caucus as a wave of popular support made the ERA seem like it was within reach of becoming the law of the land.  ,The constellation of characters consists of names most with a passing familiarity with feminist history might recognize: Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman), Flo Kennedy (Niecy Nash), Bella Abzug (,), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba), and Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne). While each episode of , is ostensibly centered on a different character, those characters are always in orbit around Schlafly. This feels like a necessary evil. , spans most of the 1970s, and Schlafly is singularly driven throughout the decade, while her opponents come from all walks of life with varied priorities. It also feels like a missed opportunity.,This comes to light most clearly in the series’s third episode, “Shirley,” which follows Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and the first black candidate to mount a presidential campaign. Specifically, it details the days leading up to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Chisholm’s campaign ended and she was pressured to release her delegates to the preferred candidate, George McGovern, without any concessions in exchange. ,In “Shirley,” , deftly fills in the spaces between the broad strokes of history, illustrating the internal disagreements in the movement as well as external forces opposing it. “Shirley,” and episodes beyond it, depict moments where experienced political movers tell activists what is or isn’t possible, where the concerns of the marginalized are often the first discarded, despite their efforts to bring the wider movement to where it is. ,Unfortunately, ,lacks the room to delve as deeply into this, as the breadth of the moment is often subject to the gravitational pull of Schlafly’s story. Again, some of this is necessary and even addressed by the show. The ERA organizers, in discussing their infighting, note that Schlafly and her STOP ERA team have one message and want one thing, while the women’s movement is concerned with a large platform of positions that are often argued over. But the show is also more interested in Schlafly, with every episode a new chapter in her slow development from ambitious political hopeful to one of the disingenuous and shrewd voices that helped build the framework for our ,. ,It’s a work that tries to understand a complicated, interesting woman but never quite finds an answer it believes. , looks at the life of Schlafly and mostly finds tragic irony: that a woman could do so much to overthrow a cause while being exemplary of that cause and that she could do more work on the ground to advance the birth of the modern conservative movement and be wholly shut out from holding any real power in it. In the show — ,—  Schlafly is accused of being the very kind of feminist she warred against, and it’s the argument , seems to agree with most. ,This informs its more , — Schlafly’s arc in , is one of ambition, not identity. What Schlafly , believes isn’t as important as what she thinks she deserves, and it’s because of this that the less palatable aspects of her biography — including alleged support by the Ku Klux Klan or the racism of her supporters — while not unmentioned, are only depicted in passing. Pivotal scenes where Schlafly begins to cross ethical lines begin to center themselves on Alice Macray (Sarah Paulson), a fictional character who eventually finds herself at odds with Schlafly — just as, it’s implied, any other reasonable woman would.,Perhaps that’s what’s most frustrating about ,In revisiting the efforts of the women’s liberation movement of the ‘70s, there , good parallels to the politics of today. It illustrates the way a lack of intersectionality can undermine movements that benefit everyone, the ease with which the disingenuous conservative machine can mobilize in the face of progress, and how the efforts of people of color are easily forgotten in the interest of so-called pragmatism or the glamour of the white artists whose work is celebrated by the upper class. ,But , can’t quite come to grips with a reality that, by 2020, should be clear: to some Americans, the public affirmation of other identities, lifestyles, or creeds is perceived as hostile to their very existence. To some Americans, there are benefits that come with perceiving yourself as Christian or white or moral, and those benefits depend on the supremacy of that identity over others. More broadly, there are plenty of Americans who don’t consider themselves to be racist or bigoted but are happy to support the political campaigns of those who are or want to live in a world more accommodating of bigotry. From Jim Crow to STOP ERA to modern gerrymandering and voter suppression, regression is as big a part of our history as progress. ,, ironically, isn’t American enough.",in american politics the equal

62,Netflix makes reality shows exclusively for the extremely online,2020-04-23,Joshua Rivera,"’s premise is hard to see as anything other than desperate. A collection of hot people are promised a hedonistic island getaway, then surprised with a big catch: a $100,000 prize, but only if they abstain from having sex. As a group of mostly accomplished sex-havers who meet each other in swimwear, this is the opposite of what they want, and the show doesn’t , expect them to not hook up; they’ll just lose some prize money every time they get too horny. Whether or not the show is good doesn’t really matter, because like all of Netflix’s 2020 reality shows, it was made to go viral — and quality doesn’t really matter for that. A successful Netflix reality show isn’t about being entertaining. It’s about being online. ,, Netflix’s first reality show of 2020, was also the most openly interested in figuring out how to bring digital life into an easily digestible reality competition. It did this by simply making social media the point, telling its contestants that they would only ever interact with each other through the show’s eponymous social network, The Circle. Because of this, they could be whoever they wanted to be. Some participants chose to stick to who they really were; others took a more ,-style approach by playing as someone else entirely.,It was a reality competition about the , — the internet in a nutshell, presented in a bingeable reality series. It’s also an easily exportable one. Currently, there’s a version of ,for the United Kingdom, Brazil, and France. These regional adaptations might as well underline the point: the internet can be a culture unto itself, a medium where personas are invented and rebuilt daily regardless of their physical circumstance. ,, Netflix’s second reality show this year, narrowed its lens to focus on dating. Like ,, it’s a potent fusion of the heightened personalities fostered by both reality television and life online. In it, contestants are divided by gender (,is cripplingly heteronormative) and kept apart, going on literal blind dates in pods where they can hear, but not see each other. It’s a mode of interaction more intimate than, say, Tinder, but still fraught with some of the same anxieties: in a world where anyone can present themselves in any way they choose, how do you know what’s genuine? ,As ,ups the stakes — to proceed in the “experiment” (as the show calls itself), couples must get engaged, sight unseen — the series takes a very online concern to Bravo-esque heights of surrealism. Couples with only a handful of conversations under their belt meet each others’ families, prepare for a wedding, and try to not second-guess their relationship now that they can hang out with other contestants. In juxtaposing participants’ initial isolation with the messiness of reality television, it takes on a common theme with ,: consistency as authenticity. ,The couples , gets the most mileage out of are the ones who dependably lean into their broad archetype; even if their personas do not appear genuine. While not a competition, there are heroes (the sincere and sweet Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed) and villains (the vain and superficial Matthew Barnett and Amber Pike). As other couples fall to the wayside, , becomes an endurance test to see if your chosen (or, given the genre we’re dealing with, assigned) persona holds, wringing drama from moments where masks look like they may slip. It’s telling that for Hamilton and Speed, the show never really ended — the two have leveraged their newfound fame ,.,That consistency brings us back to ,, the newest and shallowest show in Netflix’s growing reality TV empire. Unlike the other shows, which sort its characters ,style into various archetypes, ,’s cast mostly falls on a scale that goes from selfish to horny, or selfish and horny, and counts on that to be enough. The cynicism of the enterprise makes for a show that barely seems like it should even hold together. It’s hosted by a smart speaker named Lana that looks like ,, there’s a narrator who provides commentary that barely makes sense, and it’s all tied together with halfhearted moralizing messages about how contestants might learn there is more to love than sex. ,Yet it doesn’t really matter because, again: this is about being online, except that, unlike Netflix’s other reality shows, it’s not interested in people. It gives its contestants almost zero opportunities to slide from person to performance, everyone involved is only as interesting as their last Instagram (and whether they will succumb and have sex). It’s the internet as pure consumption and not creation. ,To those who lead an online life, it’s no secret that performance lies at the heart of it. This is why “catfish” is a verb and not just the title of a movie / TV show, why YouTubers and live-streamers foster ,, and why we’ve developed a nigh-innate ability to decipher what’s implied by the angle, background, and framing of a given Instagram post. We know that posting does not make a person, so we decide on a case-by-case basis if the posts are good enough to connect with on their own merit, or if we’d rather see a person on the other end of the screen. ,That Netflix’s reality programming would take on a uniquely online texture shouldn’t be terribly surprising. In terms of ubiquity and traffic, ,, accounting for an astonishing amount of time and bandwidth. Just as reality television emerged on cable and broadcast to present a , populated by , that gamified small-screen fame, it’s being reinvented on Netflix for our extremely online world. If Netflix’s reality shows seem a little more ridiculous than what came before, it’s because they are: the ante has been upped, and reality television is no longer about “normal” people competing against scripted dramas and comedies. ,Now, the whole internet is the network, and everyone with a smartphone is competition. Going viral could happen to you, so why would you watch someone else striving for small-scale fame? Unless, of course, they’re reckless enough to try something like, say, moving into a building full of potential catfish where their only communication was a fake social network. Or marry someone they’d never get to see until they proposed. Or completely ruin a small team of aspiring influencer’s chances at winning money because you cannot keep your hands off each other. That might work. It might be enough to get people to stop posting about their own lives for long enough to post about a few lives sponsored by Netflix.

Its biggest films — ,and ,— all went home empty-handed. ,Only just a week prior, Netflix’s studio chief Ted Sarandos rebuked claims that its lack of awards at previous award shows is part of a “backlash to a tech giant that is upending entertainment-industry business practices and threatening Hollywood power hierarchies,” as ,.,“A pushback? Nobody can say that with a straight face,” Sarandos said. “We got 24 nominations, the most of any studio. Our films have been honored across the board.” ,Netflix’s Oscar push has been aggressive.

68,Narcos: Mexico is a show for people who want the drug war to last forever,2020-02-14,Joshua Rivera,"started as a show about Pablo Escobar, a real-life gangster who outdid even the most outrageous fictional ones. The show built a compelling two-season crime thriller around his astonishing life and death. But while Escobar died, , — a hit that premiered in 2015, when Netflix was rapidly building its streaming empire — needed to go on. A third season followed another Colombian cartel. Then a spinoff, ,, tracked a parallel cartel in Central America. The first season detailed its rise; the second chronicles its fall. If there was any point to all this, it’s become hard to keep track of. The show is too busy following the cocaine., is the story of Mexico’s first drug kingpin, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (Diego Luna). The 10 episodes that premiere this week detail the dramatic implosion of Gallardo’s empire, a collapse that makes for extremely bingeable television. Yet, despite the thrilling spectacle, exhaustion seeps in. Even though it aims at being something more, , doesn’t seem to have ambitions far beyond those of the criminals it follows, pushing more product. ,The second season of , wants to make a point about consequences, at least on a surface level. The collapse of Gallardo’s empire stems directly from brash actions taken during his ascent — most directly, the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña), which sends agent Walt Breslin on a reckless mission of retribution. There are also bridges burned along the way, friendships set ablaze to use as fuel for ambition that leave many eager to see Gallardo out of power. ,Throughout, , occasionally makes overtures at the grander significance of the story it’s telling. Across 10 episodes, Gallardo’s desperate maneuvers to retain control of his business and stick it to those who have slighted him have consequences that reverberate beyond the criminal underworld, ultimately resulting in a rigged presidential election. “Sound familiar?” the show’s narrator winks. ,There is a long series of assumptions in this, ideas that have been present in , from the start, even as it occasionally paid lip service to their subversion: that Central and South American nations are lawless playgrounds for the corrupt, where prosperity can only be seized by crooks and violence reigns. Every now and then , does its diligence to complicate this picture, almost entirely via narration: a tossed off line that notes the Mexican and Colombian drug trades exist wholly to serve the appetites of the wealthy in the US and Europe, or another about the fundamentally destabilizing influence of the United States’ foreign policy that created problems in exchange for the glow up of “solving” them. ,The actual moral universe of the show is far simpler: dope dealers deserve whatever’s coming to them, the bad guys often win, and the good guys should be able to do whatever it takes to stop them. , can’t truly complicate itself any further because doing so would acknowledge that all these stories are the same story, and in telling them, the show becomes complicit. Midway through the first season of ,, Gallardo (Diego Luna) leaves his native country for a secret meeting in South America. In a moment that’s designed to be a big surprise for longtime , fans, Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) is waiting for him. ,“I’ve always sort of seen this as of the Marvel superhero universe of connecting narcotraffickers, and that they all coexist,” showrunner Eric Newman , not long after the season premiered in 2018. It’s a crass way of describing the dynamics at play in these stories of cartels and corruption, but also a very American one. The gringos, as the Mexicans doing the dirty work for the cartel bosses say, always want more. And what better expression of “more” is there than the excesses of the modern cinematic universe? ,This is how , has carried on, and how it will carry on if it continues its run. Just as , harkened back to , with a well-deployed Escobar cameo depicting a meeting that likely never happened in the real world, the show continues to hint at the ways it will sprawl outward and continue telling these kinds of stories now that it has exhausted the drama of Gallardo’s Federation. It’s not subtle about it either, making sure in its first season that you know Gallardo’s driver Joaquín Guzmán goes by “Chapo” and spending a considerable amount of time this season laying the groundwork for rivalries that he will carry into the future, for what will be one of the most prolonged conflicts in the history of Mexico’s drug war. ,You could tell this story indefinitely, because it is still being told today, with every story of a white person enraged at the sound of Spanish being spoken, with every ICE raid, with every chant for the wall. Cartel dramas like , are fairy tales for a nation in decline, flattening diverse and complicated countries for the benefit of a nation that refuses to acknowledge the havoc it has wreaked on the world.

70,"Hunters review: good at killing Nazis, and very bad at most other things",2020-02-19,Joshua Rivera," has a premise that feels like a double entendre. Amazon’s Jordan Peele-produced drama about Nazi hunters in the 1970s feels made with this specific moment when white nationalist sentiment gets parroted by government officials and in the national news. Characters are constantly saying things in a way that winkingly acknowledges the camera: ,The delivery always sounds like a dick joke, but the dick is Nazis. ,The slow-burn premiere introduces Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman), a Jewish teenager who lives in Brooklyn with his grandmother. When said grandmother is murdered in their home, Jonah discovers something she hid from the world: she was a member of a secret fraternity of Nazi-hunting vigilantes, exacting revenge on those conspiring to bring about a Fourth Reich. ,Headed by the wealthy Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino), the Hunters (if they sound like a superhero team, that’s intentional) methodically vet and seek out their victims and dole out painful justice on them, making sure they know exactly what crimes they are asking for. Interspersed throughout are interludes and flashbacks to concentration camps and the atrocities committed therein, lest the viewer start to feel that the Hunters are being a little , cruel. ,There are also strange diversions into dance, Guy Ritchie-style title cards but with a Yiddish exploitation twist, and fourth wall-breaking sketches. The villains monologue and salute a long-deceased Hitler with tears in their eyes. , is in the business of hurricane-force whiplash.,The only real anchors in all of this are the show’s two leads, Jonah and Offerman, and unfortunately, only one of them works. Despite being the de facto protagonist, Jonah doesn’t offer much to latch on to as a character. We get brief glimpses of his personal life — his friends, his crush, the anti-Semitic bully who tries to cheat Jonah out of the drugs he has to sell in order to help his grandmother pay the rent — but it’s all in the service of the plot. If we meet a person in his life, it’s because they’re going to ferry him to wherever he needs to be for the next scene to happen. ,This makes all of his big moments feel like they occur in a vacuum — especially when he’s paired up with the other Hunters, all of whom have a disappointingly small amount of screentime. Pacino is great. Everyone else makes you wonder what their deal is. (Also, Josh Radnor is on this show... why?),The five episodes that were made available in advance to critics leave things at a critical juncture halfway through the 10-episode season. Some of ,’ biggest thematic questions revolve around whether ends justify means or if the pursuit of vengeance risks corrupting those who seek it. These are familiar questions, perhaps even tired ones, but it’s possible that , comes up with an interesting answer. ,This is the upshot of a show as tonally uneven as ,: there’s no telling how it’s going to end. It’s hard to be optimistic. While the show does a lot of different things, one thing it doesn’t do is spend its time well. The first episode is nearly an hour and a half long; each of the four that follow clock in at about an hour. An inordinate amount of that time is spent mulling over a missed opportunity, longing for moments with the barely expressed rage of Pacino’s Offerman, or following any of the other Hunters instead of Jonah. It’s telling that, for all its stylistic quirks, the show is at its best when it’s playing it straight: the fourth episode, which tells twin stories of a bank heist and a couple’s desperate escape from a concentration camp, is among the best of the bunch and is delivered in a simple fashion. ,Like the eponymous team it follows, ,has a list of goals, and some of those goals are in conflict with one another. It wants to be a harrowing remembrance of the suffering of the Holocaust, a satisfying revenge fantasy, a sensational period piece, and a dark comedy. These can all be achieved together with skill, but only if the tension between them is acknowledged and addressed. Instead, the show shifts from tone to tone, more temperamental than genre-bending thrill ride.,It’s frustrating because even the ridiculous, preening Nazis of , share a trait that real-life fascists have: they know what they want.

71,Dish Network floats merger with DirecTV over pace of cord-cutting,2020-02-19,Chaim Gartenberg,"The two biggest satellite TV providers — Dish Network and DirecTV — may be looking to merge, according to Dish chairman Charlie Ergen, who called a potential merger with its biggest satellite rival “inevitable” on the company’s Q4 earnings call, according to ,. ,The news comes as Dish reports that in Q4 2019 it lost 100,000 satellite TV subscribers, along with roughly 94,000 Sling TV subscribers — the first time Sling TV’s subscribers have ever gone down. The drop in satellite customers isn’t nearly as bad as Dish reported a year ago, when it lost 386,000 subscribers, but it’s certainly not a good trend to see. All told, Dish lost a net total of 511,000 subscribers in 2019, compared to a loss of about 1.13 million in 2018. ,It’s that ongoing downward trend that led Ergen to comment that Dish and DirecTV “should get together,” noting that “the growth in TV is not coming from linear TV providers, but from huge programmers.” It’s not entirely clear what a merger would look like, given that DirecTV is currently owned by AT&T, but a sale of the satellite portion of AT&T’s TV business to Dish seems like a distinct possibility, especially given AT&T’s focus on new ,. ,Ergen went on to note that there would likely be regulatory issues to work out — after all, Dish and DirecTV already make up a considerable portion of the satellite market, and had already been barred from merging back in 2002 over concerns of eliminating competition. But the increased pressure from nontraditional internet TV services and streaming is taking a toll. “You just can’t swim upstream against a real tide of big players,” Ergen said.

72,How The Mandalorian teamed up with Fortnite creator Epic Games to create its digital sets,2020-02-20,Chaim Gartenberg,"One of the most impressive parts of , (other than ,) was the production design, with the varied locations, sets, and effects despite the comparatively lower budget for television as opposed to a blockbuster film. ,As it turns out, that’s because most of it wasn’t real. Rather, more than half of the season was shot using Industrial Light & Magic’s new StageCraft technology, which uses giant 20-foot-tall LED video screens to create fully digital environments as in-camera sets and backdrops, ,. ,Those environments are purely digital creations, which ILM ,, and then projected around the actors and physical set elements (like spaceship parts or speeder bikes) to create the finished project. As part of that effect, those LED screens are actually then shot on camera for a seamless effect that replicates location shooting without the costs. (The 3D environments are specifically lit and rendered from the perspective of the camera to accomplish that.),There are also real benefits to the virtual sets compared to a traditional green screen setup. Since the actors are actually on the set with the displays, they can see and react to things in the background while they’re actually shooting, instead of imagining effects that will be added later.,It also means that the lightning from those digital sets is present on set and interacting with the physical elements, like the actors and props. So shots where Mando and Baby Yoda sit around a fire, with the sunset shining off Mando’s armor still look right because that light is actually there on set. It’s just coming from an LED screen instead of an actual sun. ,Additionally, because the “sets” are just digitally projected 3D environments, they can be moved around and edited on the fly. Don’t like where a mountain is in the background for a particular shot? Simply move it around, or just delete it entirely. ,ILM had already been using effects like this on existing films, ,, where the “windows” of the Millennium Falcon were digital screens, allowing for the lighting effect of the hyperspace jumps to be projected on the actors’ faces in camera. But , took the technology to a much bigger scale, with a 270-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling that created a 75-foot-wide set.,Again, check out ILM’s video to get the full look at StageCraft. But best of all, ,’s first season is just the start for this new tech. The company announced today that it’ll be making StageCraft available for use by filmmakers and showrunners worldwide as an end-to-end solution, meaning that the digital set technology could be showing up in a lot more TV shows and movies in the future.",one of the most impressive parts of other than was the production design with the varied locations sets and effects despite the comparatively lower budget for television as opposed to a blockbuster film as it turns out that s because most of it wasn t real rather more than half of the season was shot using industrial light magic s new stagecraft technology which uses giant foot tall led video screens to create fully digital environments as in camera sets and backdrops those environments are purely digital creations which ilm and then projected around the actors and physical set elements like spaceship parts or speeder bikes to create the finished project as part of that effect those led screens are actually then shot on camera for a seamless effect that replicates location shooting without the costs the d environments are specifically lit and rendered from the perspective of the camera to accomplish that there are also real benefits to the virtual sets compared to a traditional green screen setup since the actors are actually on the set with the displays they can see and react to things in the background while they re actually shooting instead of imagining effects that will be added later it also means that the lightning from those digital sets is present on set and interacting with the physical elements like the actors and props so shots where mando and baby yoda sit around a fire with the sunset shining off mando s armor still look right because that light is actually there on set it s just coming from an led screen instead of an actual sun additionally because the sets are just digitally projected d environments they can be moved around and edited on the fly don t like where a mountain is in the background for a particular shot simply move it around or just delete it entirely ilm had already been using effects like this on existing films where the windows of the millennium falcon were digital screens allowing for the lighting effect of the hyperspace jumps to be projected on the actors faces in camera but took the technology to a much bigger scale with a degree semicircular led video wall and ceiling that created a foot wide set again check out ilm s video to get the full look at stagecraft but best of all s first season is just the start for this new tech the company announced today that it ll be making stagecraft available for use by filmmakers and showrunners worldwide as an end to end solution meaning that the digital set technology could be showing up in a lot more tv shows and movies in the future ,one impressive part production design varied location set effect despite comparatively lower budget television opposed blockbuster film turn real rather half season shot using industrial light magic new stagecraft technology us giant foot tall led video screen create fully digital environment camera set backdrop environment purely digital creation ilm projected around actor physical set element like spaceship part speeder bike create finished project part effect led screen actually shot camera seamless effect replicates location shooting without cost environment specifically lit rendered perspective camera accomplish also real benefit virtual set compared traditional green screen setup since actor actually set display see react thing background actually shooting instead imagining effect added later also mean lightning digital set present set interacting physical element like actor prop shot mando baby yoda sit around fire sunset shining mando armor still look right light actually set coming led screen instead actual sun additionally set digitally projected environment moved around edited fly like mountain background particular shot simply move around delete entirely ilm already using effect like existing film window millennium falcon digital screen allowing lighting effect hyperspace jump projected actor face camera took technology much bigger scale degree semicircular led video wall ceiling created foot wide set check ilm video get full look stagecraft best first season start new tech company announced today making stagecraft available use filmmaker showrunners worldwide end end solution meaning digital set technology could showing lot show movie future
73,This disturbingly realistic deepfake puts Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in a Star Trek episode,2020-02-20,Jay Peters,"A new deepfake puts Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pilot episode of the original ,, “The Cage” — and I kind of love it. In this particular AI-powered face swap, Bezos plays a Talosian alien with a huge bald head, while Musk plays Captain Christopher Pike (who is the captain of the USS Enterprise before James T. Kirk). 	,Here’s a very short version of what’s going on in this scene, if you’re wondering: in this episode, the Talosian aliens capture Pike to enslave him and use him to breed humans that will be used to rebuild a destroyed society. Pike tries to escape throughout the episode, and eventually, the Talosians decide that humans’ resistance to captivity won’t make them a good fit for that plan.,The conversation is kind of hard to follow, and that’s probably because the clips from the episode are stitched together to make it seem like it’s only the Talosian alien and Captain Pike having a conversation.

At the start of the series, Saul Goodman — best known as Walter White’s huckster lawyer in , — goes by another name, the one given to him at birth. Jimmy McGill is a different, more earnest person than Saul Goodman, someone who does not exist in ,. Unlike Walter White, we know exactly what’s going to happen to Jimmy, and ,is a better show for it. ,In the show’s fifth season, Jimmy’s transformation into Saul is nearly complete. McGill is getting his feet under him after the death of his brother and the end of a yearlong suspension from practicing law. Now, he’s back in the saddle and trying to build his practice as fast as possible under his Saul Goodman alias, which he used for much of the last season to build connections with petty criminals he sold burner phones to for fast cash. ,It’s all so very sad, even if Bob Odenkirk’s carnival barker performance as Jimmy / Saul is as entertaining and funny as it’s always been. As a man who lost his brother, Jimmy never gives himself the opportunity to mourn, instead throwing himself back into the world of two-bit hustles that he knows best, working over suckers and building his reputation in the untapped market of low-level criminals in the habit of committing misdemeanors. Bit by bit, Jimmy McGill is being buried alive, and Saul Goodman is holding the shovel. ,Like the show from which it spun off, ,’s dramatic arc is an inevitable one. We know that things aren’t going to end well from the start — to a degree that , might sound repetitive to people who have seen ,. On a superficial level, this is true: both are shows about a man going sour. But the hows and whys of ,’s downward slide feel more vital and relevant, perhaps because they are more tragic. ,If ,showed us what entitled toxic masculinity looked like when it ran rampant in the life of the most milquetoast protagonist imaginable, , is about a slower, sadder thing: a man who learns that having feelings is for suckers. It’s a show for the irony-poisoned and extremely online where nothing is assumed to be genuine, and everything is probably a scam. , is concerned with what happens when people decide that scamming is the only way to win, and the immense harm inflicted by people who have convinced themselves that anyone behaving earnestly is just playing the game wrong. In ,, this is illustrated by Kim Wexler, Jimmy’s longtime friend and girlfriend / partner, a damn good lawyer in her own right with a bit of a grifter’s streak in her. ,Kim, however, is a character of integrity with a sense of justice and lines that she only crosses when that notion of justice is violated. She’s a vigilante scammer where McGill is an equal-opportunity swindler. At the end of the day, she believes in the system and in Jimmy’s capacity to be an honest man. This means, in ,’s universe, she’s doomed. ,In this penultimate season — the show will only return for one more — Kim is learning a truth that Jimmy’s in denial of: no matter how much you tell someone that they are capable of being honest or good, once they have decided that truth does not pay, it’s only a matter of time before they stop maintaining the charade altogether. And once someone has lost every reason to believe in earnest feeling or honesty or justice, they slowly start believing everyone else has, too. ,This is what , has been building toward: a fifth season premiere where Jimmy, as Saul Goodman, erects a carnival tent in an empty lot, surrounded by people who he believes are lost causes who will eventually need a lost cause like himself. The descent is more or less complete. As Jimmy builds the Goodman name, the cartel power players from , begin asserting themselves, and the gilded cage Saul Goodman will ultimately try to flee at the end of that series is nearing completion. He’s going to have it good for a while, though. Grifters always do. That’s part of the problem: we love a good scam. Feelings are for suckers.

78,"New trailers: Westworld, Amazing Stories, and more",2020-02-22,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I recently watched ,, Joanna Hogg’s partly autobiographical film about a young filmmaker who gets wrapped up in a toxic and emotionally abusive relationship with an older man.

The entire beginning of the central romantic relationship is left offscreen, as is all but the ending of a very significant argument between the couple.

81,"In I Am Not Okay With This, being a teen girl does not get easier with superpowers",2020-02-28,Joshua Rivera," begins with Sydney Novak, covered in blood, running down the middle of the street at night. There are probably other ways she’d rather be spending her time. That would seem to make sense with the series’s narrative: her life is pretty normal — up until the part where you find out she has superpowers that allow her to blow things up with her mind. ,Netflix’s new comedy is a work of low-key dread that recalls a lot of other stories about young women coming of age. It has ,’s supernatural angst, ,’s oddball quirk, and the smart-twee edge of ,. Syd is a gross weirdo — she’s equally fascinated and frustrated by her leg acne, pretty fine with being ostracized by her classmates, and perplexed by the people she is attracted to. The difference here is that Syd is also very, very angry.,Sydney’s powers are a manifestation of her rage, and she has plenty to be mad about. Her best friend has fallen for a crude jock, her single mom is overworked and demanding, and, as the show slowly reveals, there’s a deep family trauma that has haunted her since before the series began. ,But even with this in mind, , spends most of its time being more charming than angry. Much of it focuses on Syd’s budding relationship with fellow weirdo Stanley Barber. Stanley is played by Wyatt Oleff — best known as one of the kids in , — who reads here as Timothee Chalamet, but a little bit wrong. This plays incredibly well opposite Sophia Lillis’ Syd, another , star and a tremendously talented young actor. ,Lillis juggles all of Sydney’s wildly conflicting emotions with ease, able to simultaneously portray the anxieties expressed in the running narration from Syd’s diary that’s read throughout the show and the quirky facade she presents to the world. With only seven short episodes, there’s not a whole lot of plot to burn through, but Lillis’ performance never lets you forget the multitude of emotions burning beneath Syd’s disaffected exterior. , doesn’t really end as much as it stops in its tracks. The season finishes with an abrupt conclusion that is clearly meant to set up a second season, but it also brings little in the way of resolution — something that feels a bit unfair given how lean and sharp the show is, each episode taking only just the time it needs to make its point and leave. (Usually, this doesn’t take much more than 20 minutes.),It doesn’t help that its cliffhanger ending tugs at the one plot thread that would make the show stand out beyond its new-school take on ,. Since its first image immediately conjures ,’s climax, the comparison is unavoidable and will immediately cause you to guess where,is going. (You probably won’t be that far off from the truth.) There’s more to this story, and readers of the Charles Forsman graphic novel it’s based on might be frustrated at some of its most fascinating and darkest plot beats are being reserved for another set of episodes. ,Despite this, ,works really well because of all the things it conveys without speaking a word, all of them difficult: being a young woman who doesn’t adhere to a narrow definition of femininity, who is figuring out her sexuality, who is handling grief, disillusionment, poverty, , superpowers.

It was great! , made me worried that the film would be too stylized and stark, but I was actually really impressed at how it balanced those elements were while still telling the straight story.,The film uses a lot of the stylized humor to set up its characters and world, then slowly fades it out as the drama ratchets up. Emma’s father is constantly ridiculous, a key love interest is dressed down before he’s built back up, and a secondary character is annoying to exaggerated lengths, nicely setting up how she later impacts the plot.,Finding that balance between stylized humor and natural storytelling always seems challenging, and I love how much it happens in setups and payoffs here. It all tends to work together, with the funnier moments (like the introduction of an elaborate picture frame) cooling down and setting up important moments down the road where those ridiculous elements are now just part of the scenery.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Last week, HBO put out the first trailer for , season 3 — but naturally, because this is ,, there was also a series of hidden trailers for fans to uncover... which they quickly did.

It comes out on April 3rd.",as the leader of fan group i obviously went to go see last weekend it was great made me worried that the film would be too stylized and stark but i was actually really impressed at how it balanced those elements were while still telling the straight story the film uses a lot of the stylized humor to set up its characters and world then slowly fades it out as the drama ratchets up emma s father is constantly ridiculous a key love interest is dressed down before he s built back up and a secondary character is annoying to exaggerated lengths nicely setting up how she later impacts the plot finding that balance between stylized humor and natural storytelling always seems challenging and i love how much it happens in setups and payoffs here it all tends to work together with the funnier moments like the introduction of an elaborate picture frame cooling down and setting up important moments down the road where those ridiculous elements are now just part of the scenery check out nine trailers from this week below last week hbo put out the first trailer for season but naturally because this is there was also a series of hidden trailers for fans to

83,"McMillions review: finally, the burger-related true crime series we’ve been waiting for",2020-03-02,Joshua Rivera,"It’s a good idea to have a few questions in mind whenever you order a burger. Nothing too wild. Simple stuff, like: Does this burger have cheese? (It should.) Other toppings? (Knock yourself out.) How about fries on the side? (Anything worth doing is worth doing right.) And then the most important question: Is this burger involved in a massive, years-long fraud scheme? Because, as HBO’s , would like to remind us, if you got a McDonald’s burger in the ’90s in the hopes of winning the chain’s annual Monopoly game, there was a huge criminal conspiracy devoted to robbing you of your chance to strike it rich. ,The documentary miniseries — which has aired four of six episodes — brings viewers back to the heyday of McDonald’s most successful promotion, which encouraged customers nationwide to buy fast food in order to score more Monopoly-themed game pieces. Prizes for collecting these pieces ranged from inconsequential (free fries) to massive ($1 million). And for twelve years, the game was completely rigged by a slowly expanding group of criminals who figured out how to crack the system. , devotes its hour-long episodes into slowly unspooling how this crime unfolded over its decade-plus reign, starting from the FBI agents who first started to pursue a tip they nearly dismissed outright, to the associates of the suspects they identify as the case gains traction. It’s a great story in and of itself, one ,in the summer of 2018. For the first few minutes of , however, you wonder if it’s being oversold — there’s some truly cheesy re-enactments, and the show’s initial focus makes it feel terribly narrow, like there isn’t much to hold your attention for five more hours of this. ,But there is much more, and the reasons to keep watching start piling up fast. First, there’s Agent Doug Matthews, the most prominent source early on. A junior agent in the FBI at the time the investigation into the Monopoly fraud scheme began, Matthews is such a good TV character it’s hard to believe he is, in fact, a real person. Loquacious and vain, Matthews talks with a soft drawl and heavy bravado, happy to recount his early days helping to construct an elaborate and reckless sting to draw out the fraudsters. He’s almost , eager, to the point where it starts to feel strange to essentially start rooting for the feds at a point where it’s not clear what the ,crime is. Then the bigger picture starts to come into focus, and the cast of characters expands. , quickly becomes a whirlwind tour of an unlikely underworld, full of wannabe gangsters, Southern real estate impresarios, and friendly drug dealers who look like Jerry from ,. Like a lot of the most satisfying mysteries, the who of this story is apparent early on, and the hows and whys are what keeps you watching.,Mostly, it’s extremely satisfying to get lost in a true crime tale that doesn’t revolve around a grisly murder or the grifting of everyday people — the biggest victims here are almost always McDonald’s, and the people who get too greedy as the Monopoly fraud scheme grows. ,The biggest note of discomfort in , doesn’t necessarily relate to the fraud scheme at hand, but the idea of McDonald’s. Early on in the show, the corporation is described as being eager to cooperate with the FBI because of its brand image, a talking head noting that if McDonald’s cannot be trusted thanks to some fraudsters, it would cause irreparable damage to the brand. It’s an aside that kept coming to mind as footage lifted from news reports over the last decade or so played throughout the miniseries, video that showed all manner of everyday people flocking to their local franchise to eat. ,It’s striking how ordinary they are in comparison to the louder cast of characters that , follows. They’re an unassuming bunch of people, presumably doing what they need to do to get through an already-too-stressful day. They remind me of the times I ate McDonald’s as a kid, one of too many mouths to feed on not enough money, and then again as an adult, stretched thin and aware that it was sold to me by people paid too little, stretched as thin as I was, for the benefit of suits who, frankly, did not care.

85,"The Magicians is ending after season 5, but it’s raised the bar for fantasy shows",2020-03-04,Megan Farokhmanesh,"SyFy , weird, wild fantasy show , for a sixth season. Yesterday, the network announced that the current season will be its last. ,’ story will wrap up in the finale, slated for April 1st, and with it goes one of TV’s most underrated shows airing today.,At its outset, “what if Harry Potter, but with college orgies” was a fair shorthand explanation for exactly what the show was. Best friends Quentin Coldwater and Julia Wicker learn they have magical potential and are tested to enter a highly selective college. Quentin gets in; Julia gets booted. As their paths diverge in major ways, both begin to learn that magic has a cost, even when it’s dressed up with party tricks and cute co-eds.,It would have been easy for , to continue on as the wildly cliched story of one loner white guy, forever believing he’s special, learning that actually he is. And for a little bit, the show does. Much like the books the show is based on, Quentin is depressed, insufferable, and could probably use a shower. Lev Grossman’s trilogy is almost entirely preoccupied with Quentin’s experiences, Quentin’s point of view, Quentin’s fantastical journey. In contrast, the show’s writers have deftly adapted the best source material, while also crafting a diverse ensemble cast that takes focus off Quentin, ironically its weakest link. They’ve expanded its world in far more interesting, boundary-pushing ways. ,They allowed characters like Eliot and Margo, played by Hale Appleman and Summer Bishil, respectively, to evolve into the true beating heart of the show. That’s in large part due to the stellar acting of Appleman and Bishil, natural scene-stealers who make for an electric pair. But few characters like Eliot and Margo even , on TV. Eliot is an exceptionally charming disaster, haunted by his own vices, saved by his dedication to his friends and good heart. Margo, who could have easily been written off as the tired trope of a mean girl with anger issues, was given space and nuance to exist as a powerful woman fighting to endure in worlds that did not want her. Her path has been one of the show’s best as we’ve come to understand the layers of pain and anger that exist alongside her confidence, tenderness, and moments of royal fuck-ups. Together, the two are a perfect foil for each other, a pair whose platonic love for one another acts as a throughline for everything they do. That’s also to say nothing of their on-screen representation as a queer man and a woman of color.,Over the course of its run, , tackled topics like depression, sexual assault, death, drug addiction, burgeoning queer sexuality, and gender politics. Magic is not the focus of the show, but rather a complement to the lives of characters who still inhabit a very modern world. In season 5, a big emphasis has been placed on characters dealing with loss, PTSD, and learning how to find purpose again as they move into new stages of their lives. It’s delivered many of these poignant, rich storylines while also setting itself against backdrops that involve drug trips, time loops, and breaking the moon.,That was the beauty of ,: its world could still feel surprising and fun, even in the face of utter devastation. Its writers are clearly genre nerds who loved to pay homage to and play with storylines involving time travel, epic fetch quests, and bank heists, and the show is better for it. I never thought I’d earnestly try to convince any of my friends that its best moments include an impromptu musical number in which the cast has to sing Queen’s “Under Pressure,” a disco ball bomb that forces people to dance, or even that my favorite joke is a 10-second gag involving a talking rabbit that only says “eat my ass.”  ,That a show could do all of that and still have something to say about the human condition is what made it special. Not even magic can solve the pain of being alive. But for five years, , helped just a little.

86,Warren Ellis wrote Castlevania season 3 in a ‘rapture of mad power’,2020-03-06,Adi Robertson,"Netflix’s , is the rare video game adaptation that’s actually worth watching. Executive produced by Adi Shankar and written by prolific comics author Warren Ellis, it remixes the classic gothic series into a bloody anime-influenced adventure featuring some of the games’ biggest characters. Yesterday, Netflix released a third season that’s longer, weirder, and more ambitious than its predecessors.,I spoke to Ellis and , executive producer Kevin Kolde about how the show has evolved while still drawing inspiration from Konami’s games. I also got to ask about some of my favorite pieces of season 3. So while there aren’t major plot points revealed in the interview, it references specific characters and events — and anything ahead could be considered a spoiler.,In some senses, I think you’re probably not wrong. Due to the events of season 2, we now have a power vacuum in that region of the world — and also a degree of chaos. A lot of people are not very organized. And if you don’t have a plan, you become part of someone else’s plan, and it’s never comfortable for you. So in a sense, while I’m not sure I would go with the word “cruel,” I think possibly the situation is a lot scarier and less stable than maybe people would have expected after the end of season 2., Famously, I never played the games, so I have no real knowledge of the series except what’s on Wikipedia or a fan page. But as I had the opportunity to broaden the cast and introduce new characters, Saint Germain leapt out to me because I’ve always been fascinated by that period of itinerant magicians and astrologists touring the great courts of Europe and doing people’s charts for coins.,And the Infinite Corridor was just such a weird thing to find in the material. “Oh by the way, there’s a channel to alternate worlds in the games somewhere!” That was just so random that I couldn’t leave it alone.,I’ve got nothing I can play the games on! I’m sitting here in front of an old ThinkPad. I’ve never actually owned a games console apart from the Atari my granddad gave us for Christmas in like 1982 or something. So I wouldn’t even know how., There’s also a bunch of people on the team that have played the games and played them sort of voraciously. Our director Sam Deats and assistant director and brother Adam Deats are huge , game nerds, and you’ll find a lot of elements from the game that they bring in.,Dracula was the oldest and had been through many many life changes, and you have to work really hard , to develop a degree of self-reflection if you’re going to live that long and go through that many experiences. So some of his responses played as more human than the human characters.,In season 3, all of the characters are a lot younger, and they’re a lot more turned inward. Dracula was not necessarily about thirst as a vampire. Most of the other characters are all about their thirst. So that kind of gives them a sharper edge as antagonists. They are more human in that they’re a lot more focused on what they want, which, in a lot of ways, makes them more immediately dangerous., Well, as I enter close to my second half-century of life, I’m possibly flattering myself. But you know, I’ve read interviews with people who are a hundred years old, and they do have a level of self-awareness and self-reflection that I find fascinating. So I kind of moved that over into Dracula a bit.,The squad from Styria! No, I think I made them all up. It just made sense to me that she would have a crew. She would be co-ruling with other people because she’s been spending time away from Styria and she wouldn’t just leave that to anybody. So as soon as I landed on the idea that she would be ruling with other people, it was clear that it would be with other women. So then I started inventing all the other three characters.,It almost mirrors season 2 where Dracula fades into the background a little bit. He’s away with his plans and his misery and the other characters kind of come to the fore. So it’s kind of mirroring that and suggesting she’s entering a Dracula-like role. Also, I had the space! I could introduce new characters I found interesting see how they strike off each other., Oh, you caught that! Oh, god. Okay. Thank you., Not on my watch! Sorry, I didn’t say that. It’s terrible, because [voice actor] Theo James, he’s got that big resonant heroic voice that immediately makes me hate him. But also, he does this thing where he can let little cracks of insecurity and vulnerability into his voice, which fascinated me. The confluence of these two things meant that I had immense fun just torturing the poor guy., It’s interesting because some of this is cyclical. The situation in Wallachia, you could relate to relatively current events. But you know, 50 percent of the time, a dictator is removed from any region, there’s a power vacuum and a civil war. This is just how these things happen, sadly. So some of it could come from my reading of history, some could come from my responses to current events. I try not to interrogate it too closely when I’m doing it, not least because nobody needs an opportunity for me to get up on my soapbox and start waving my arms. I try to do less of that these days., I try to stay out of it, not least because you only have to have one bad day and then you’re that writer who shows up to tell everyone they’re watching it or reading it wrong. Once a year, I kind of wave to the kids on Tumblr and say thank you very much. Once the show’s done and streaming, it’s theirs to do whatever they want with., I have, by and large, retired from the internet. I just have to wake all the channels up in order to do the show launch. But yeah, I like to stay the hell away from it. People are going to say and do whatever they’re going to say and do, and they should be left alone by the writer., That’s largely a change in my relationship with it., Are we talking about the , and so on?,There are two ways in which I write the big action scenes in the show. Sometimes they’re scripted right down to the beat. And then sometimes, I’ll lead up to a scene, describe what the scene needs to be and how it’ll end and any dialog and beats I need, and then I’ll just say “Sam, I figure you’ve got about two minutes for this. Go nuts.” The tower scene is one of those scenes., The Legion character, the giant ball of bodies, was actually something Sam and Adam came back to us with once they had received the script and started working sort of a classic, scenario into the scene, and it just kind of made sense. They’re probably super happy with it, but they probably regretted it at the time because I think, technically, from an animation standpoint, it was a pretty monumental task., I think I got blamed for their misery, even though I just let them do it, and it was all their fault.,The general rapture of mad power of having 10 episodes. So sure, let’s have little philosophical conversations in the bowels of sailing ships! Let’s do a full psychedelic , Infinite Corridor! If I wanted to stop the show dead so Isaac could talk to a mad magician woman in the desert foothills of Italy, I could do it. I wanted to try to change the way the show was paced, to change the nature of some of the things we’ve talked about. They’d already ordered the season. What were they going to do? Fire me?,I killed any chance of season 4 right there. Sorry, everybody.",netflix s is the rare video game adaptation that s actually worth watching executive produced by adi shankar and written by prolific comics author warren ellis it remixes the classic gothic series into a bloody anime influenced adventure featuring some of the games biggest characters yesterday netflix released a third season that s longer weirder and more ambitious than its predecessors i spoke to ellis and executive producer kevin kolde about how the show has evolved while still drawing inspiration from konami s games i also got to ask about some of my favorite pieces of season so while there aren t major plot points revealed in the interview it references specific characters and events and anything ahead could be considered a spoiler in some senses i think you re probably not wrong due to the events of season we now have a power vacuum in that region of the world and also a degree of chaos a lot of people are not very organized and if you don t have a plan you become part of someone else s plan and it s never comfortable for you so in a sense while i m not sure i would go with the word cruel i think possibly the situation is a lot scarier and less stable than maybe people would have expected after the end of season famously i never played the games so i have no real knowledge of the series except what s on wikipedia or a fan page but as i had the opportunity to broaden the cast and introduce new characters saint germain leapt out to me because i ve always been fascinated by that period of itinerant magicians and astrologists touring the great courts of europe and doing people s charts for coins and the infinite corridor was just such a weird thing to find in the material oh by the way there s a channel to alternate worlds in the games somewhere that was just so random that i couldn t leave it alone i ve got nothing i can play the games on i m sitting here in front of an old thinkpad i ve never actually owned a games console apart from the atari my granddad gave us for christmas in like or something so i wouldn t even know how there s also a bunch of people on the team that have played the games and played them sort of voraciously our director sam deats and assistant director and brother adam deats are huge game nerds and you ll find a lot of elements from the game that they bring in dracula was the oldest and had been through many many life changes and you have to work really hard to develop a degree of self reflection if you re going to live that long and go through that many experiences so some of his responses played as more human than the human characters in season all of the characters are a lot younger and they re a lot more turned inward dracula was not necessarily about thirst as a vampire most of the other characters are all about their thirst so that kind of gives them a sharper edge as antagonists they are more human in that they re a lot more focused on what they want which in a lot of ways makes them more immediately dangerous well as i enter close to my second half century of life i m possibly flattering myself but you know i ve read interviews with people who are a hundred years old and they do have a level of self awareness and self reflection that i find fascinating so i kind of moved that over into dracula a bit the squad from styria no i think i made them all up it just made sense to me that she would have a crew she would be co ruling with other people because she s been spending time away from styria and she wouldn t just leave that to anybody so as soon as i landed on the idea that she would be ruling with other people it was clear that it would be with other women so then i started inventing all the other three characters it almost mirrors season where dracula fades into the background a little bit he s away with his plans and his misery and the other characters kind of come to the fore so it s kind of mirroring that and suggesting she s entering a dracula like role also i had the space i could introduce new characters i found interesting see how they strike off each other oh you caught that oh god okay thank you not on my watch sorry i didn t say that it s terrible because voice actor theo james he s got that big resonant heroic voice that immediately makes me hate him but also he does this thing where he can let little cracks of insecurity and vulnerability into his voice which fascinated me the confluence of these two things meant that i had immense fun just torturing the poor guy it s interesting because some of this is cyclical the situation in wallachia you could relate to relatively current events but you know percent of the time a dictator is removed from any region there s a power vacuum and a civil war this is just how these things happen sadly so some of it could come from my reading of history some could come from my responses to current events i try not to interrogate it too closely when i m doing it not least because nobody needs an opportunity for me to get up on my soapbox and start waving my arms i try to do less of that these days i try to stay out of it not least because you only have to have one bad day and then you re that writer who shows up to tell everyone they re watching it or reading it wrong once a year i kind of wave to the kids on tumblr and say thank you very much once the show s done and streaming it s theirs to do whatever they want with i have by and large retired from the internet i just have to wake all the channels up in order to do the show launch but yeah i like to stay the hell away from it people are going to say and do whatever they re going to say and do and they should be left alone by the writer that s largely a change in my relationship with it are we talking about the and so on there are two ways in which i write the big action scenes in the show sometimes they re scripted right down to the beat and then sometimes i ll lead up to a scene describe what the scene needs to be and how it ll end and any dialog and beats i need and then i ll just say sam i figure you ve got about two minutes for this go nuts the tower scene is one of those scenes the legion character the giant ball of bodies was actually something sam and adam came back to us with once they had received the script and started working sort of a classic scenario into the scene and it just kind of made sense they re probably super happy with it but they probably regretted it at the time because i think technically from an animation standpoint it was a pretty monumental task i think i got blamed for their misery even though i just let them do it and it was all their fault the general rapture of mad power of having episodes so sure let s have little philosophical conversations in the bowels of sailing ships let s do a full psychedelic infinite corridor if i wanted to stop the show dead so isaac could talk to a mad magician woman in the desert foothills of italy i could do it i wanted to try to change the way the show was paced to change the nature of some of the things we ve talked about they d already ordered the season what were they going to do fire

87,Dispatches From Elsewhere wants you to play more weird games with strangers,2020-03-04,Joshua Rivera," doesn’t feel like a show so much as it does a wish. A man named Peter stumbles across an elaborate game, one that instructs him to go to unusual places and do outlandish things. Answer a pay phone and dance in public until Bigfoot appears. Attend a shareholder’s meeting for a company that doesn’t exist. Unveil a conspiracy or spearhead a revolution. Despite all the strangeness, the show is very clear about what it wants to do: help you to feel connected to other people. It wants to foster empathy. Maybe, in the end, it might pull it off. ,But first, the series puts you off-balance with 10 seconds of silence from Richard E. Grant, seated in an orange room, staring at the camera for that entire time. Grant plays Octavio Coleman, esq., a mysterious figure who narrates the show and seems to orchestrate the game that , chronicles, and as an actor capable of a frightening and disconcerting sincerity, it’s an effective way to begin. ,In his opening monologue, Coleman tells the viewer to imagine themselves as Peter, briefly summing up the circumstances of his life, which aren’t terribly important. What is important is that he is the protagonist, and a story is about to happen to him. Coleman is effectively telling us to watch a TV show, and it would all be too cute of a device to bear if , didn’t come from a place of overwhelming sincerity.,Jason Segel, who created and stars in ,, finally returns to TV after a decade in film, writing and appearing in movies like ,and ,. As Peter, he is disaffected and disillusioned to the point where he can’t really register how unhappy he is. Then he finds a series of strange flyers, offering to teach him things like dolphin telepathy, and they function as his gateway to the Jejune Institute, Coleman’s secretive organization dedicated to the unlocking of humanity’s strangest potential (hence the dolphin telepathy). ,Upon discovering Jejune, Peter also learns that there is another secret faction, the Elsewhere Society, that believes Jejune to be evil and is dedicated to freeing Clara — an unseen woman who is directly responsible for Jejune’s innovations. Longing for some kind of meaning in his life, Peter throws himself into the Elsewhere Society’s elaborate scheme, meeting other people who, like him, have stumbled upon this strange live-action role-play shadow war, scouring the city of Philadelphia for arcane and wonderful clues that will hopefully lead to Clara. ,is eager to surprise viewers, eager to dive into the surreal and whimsical at a moment’s notice, but not particularly interested in stumping you. It’s the anti-,, a story where mystery is certainly part of the equation, but not the point. None of the characters seem to truly believe that Jejune and Elsewhere are ,, just that this game has pulled them into a world more wonderful than their own, and they’d love to live in it a little while longer. ,Instead, , wants you to sink into the lives of those who find themselves enthralled by this game. Each of the first four episodes is named after a different member of the cast, most begin with Octavio admonishing the audience to imagine themselves as one of them: first Peter; then Simone (Eve Lindley), a trans woman in love with the theater of the game but not necessarily her life; then Janice (Sally Field), an older woman wondering what comes next after you’ve passed all the milestones people prepare you for your entire life; and finally Wynnfred (Andre Benjamin), a man who understands systems more than people and desperately wants to solve the game before anyone else. ,There isn’t a thing that , does that isn’t clearly signaled from the start. The show wears its heart on its sleeve, and there’s danger in that — earnestness can be cloying, and sincerity without clarity is a one-way ticket to corniness. It helps that , is framed around an elaborate larp game — games ask you to suspend your disbelief and social conventions to submit to rules and do strange things. In giving yourself over to a game, you join other people who have made the same concessions you have, and for a little while, you have something in common. The real hope of finishing a game isn’t winning, but that everyone you played with will continue to have things in common. , is a work fully given over to this desire, one that feels particularly potent at a moment when tabletop games seem to be at a previously unseen cultural peak.

91,Devs spins a Silicon Valley murder mystery into something unsettling and strange,2020-03-09,Joshua Rivera," is not a show that’s out to confuse you. The miniseries — which is billed as an FX show but airs exclusively on , — bears a lot of the hallmarks of extremely cerebral, puzzle-box television. There is strange imagery: a massive, towering statue of a young girl delighted at the forests around her. Redwoods surrounded by LED halos. Rooms full of pulsing, warm orange lights, as if they were alive. Characters who talk around things and are forthright about little. But as heavy as the atmosphere is, the show isn’t out to lose you. Instead, it wants you on its side. It’s dispassionate but angry. Maybe you should be, too. ,Despite its preference for aesthetics over clarity, the plot of , is a simple one: Lily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno) is a computer engineer who works for Amaya, a tech company that works, vaguely, in “quantum computing.” She, like most Amaya employees, works in the public-facing side of the company, which seems successful and highly regarded, even if it’s unclear what it actually does. The real action at Amaya is in Devs, a top-secret division of the company in a building few have even seen. ,The show begins when Lily’s boyfriend, Sergei, is selected to join Devs. When Sergei is suspected of trying to steal company secrets, he is killed. Amaya says it’s suicide, and Lily suspects foul play. , is about the cat-and-mouse game that follows, as Lily tries to pin down what Fores (Nick Offerman), Amaya’s mysterious CEO, is actually up to. ,This throughline gives , a nice momentum, making it the kind of understated sci-fi thriller that creator Alex Garland has become known for. Of course, there’s more going on — what the Devs unit actually , is a big part of the story — but answers come early, and , spends most of its time contemplating what the answers it gives you might mean. ,As a result of all this, , clearly favors plot over character, making it an easy show to bounce off of if you aren’t willing to buy in completely. That’s perhaps the biggest hurdle to clear. , is a show you need to be all-in on. It’s worth it, mostly. It’s made to contemplate the new world order where the government is held in sway by tech companies that are allowed to operate inscrutably and without oversight, using their immense power to pursue whatever they want. It’s sharply critical but not openly. Depending on how you like your science fiction, you may want the show to have more teeth than it ultimately does. ,Even if it doesn’t go as far as it could, ,has a tight focus that makes it hypnotic, engrossing television, easy to slip into for an hour at a time or binge all at once if you wait. This is fitting. Much like the real-life tech companies it critiques, the show is about building a reality alongside but apart from the world most people live in, one that it shuttles people in and out of on private chartered buses where rules don’t matter and everyone is encouraged to think of themselves as god-king of a digital universe. For the few scenes set in San Francisco proper, the “real world” appears alien and wrong. ,This is the lure of Silicon Valley: like Rapture, the objectivist paradise of the , video games, it’s a place sheltered from consequence by wealth and power where the privileged wield their newfound power without restraint. , is most effective when it makes the scope of that power clear, in scenes where developers admire their handiwork, sequestered deep within their own private utopia.

93,The best movies and TV shows to stream when you’re working remotely,2020-03-13,Verge Staff,"In the era of social distancing that many of us now live in as part of a worldwide effort to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic, tons of people are now stuck at home for days or even weeks, discouraged from meeting in public places or hanging out in large groups. ,That means that it’s the perfect time to kick back, relax, and catch up on all of those great TV shows and movies you’ve been meaning to catch up on. But if you need some suggestions (or have already managed to burn through your backlog), we’ve put together our best recommendations for films you can watch to distract yourself instead of staying glued to Twitter watching terrible news stream in. ,Look, sometimes my brain isn’t dumb. It knows when I’m trying to distract it from a primal fear with shiny, happy things. But what about something , scary? That’s the appeal of horror anthology series ,, which favors a character-driven small-scale surrealism that’s completely unlike our grim planet-wide pandemic. The series starts reasonably well in season 1 (the reality-breaking TV show season), hits its stride in season 2 (the reality-breaking haunted house season), gets pulpy in season 3 (the reality-breaking cannibal family season), and wraps up in season 4 (the reality-breaking manifestation of childhood fantasies season). Just don’t look up the , , , ,, unless you’ve got enough time for an hours-long creepypasta binge, too. , ,Doctors are facing huge challenges as they try to understand and fight COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. But they can be glad they’re not Dr. Rick Dagless, MD, star of a ludicrously awful TV series from (fictional) horror author Garth Marenghi. , is ostensibly a rerelease of this series-within-a-series, framed by commentary from Marenghi and his co-star Dean Learner (actually ,Matthew Holness and Richard Ayoade). It’s also a hilarious metafictional spoof of ‘80s horror and a portrait of a small, deluded, narcissistic man who’s convinced he’s a genius. Now, is explicitly laying out some shallow thematic tie with the novel coronavirus sort of contrived here? Yes. But I know writers who use subtext, ,. , Unofficially, , is ostensibly a show about death — and one mad piemaker named Ned (played by the impossibly charming Lee Pace) who can reverse it with a touch. While the premise may sound morbid, , is a delightful, earnest, and wildly optimistic show about love, life, and using your magical powers to reverse death to right wrongs and solve crimes. It’s the perfect pick-me-up for anyone who is feeling down. ,: , (CW’s weird free streaming site),This is where I’m supposed to write a blurb about why , (2019) is a good and reassuring thing to watch. , (2019) is not a good or reassuring thing to watch. It is a nightmare, filled with writhing shapes and monstrous fur-and-flesh abominations that should never have been conceived, let alone rendered into horrifyingly realistic forms that cost hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of CGI.,What I’m saying is, if you are feeling bummed out about the pandemic, , (2019) will help alleviate those concerns by giving you something far worse to think about. , It’ll be available digitally on March 17th on online stores like ,, ,, and , is my go-to show when I just need something chill to watch. The show is about a group of high school girls in rural Japan who enjoy camping, and that’s basically it. There aren’t any real conflicts or drama; you just watch them go to these amazing actual campsites around Mt. Fuji. It also teaches you a lot about how to actually camp, and it makes the idea of camping in cold weather seem appealing. , ,When you’re in need of something to watch, you can always find a Rob Lowe classic to keep you from going bonkers while you’re under quarantine. If you need something to soothe your political anxiety, watch Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn in ,. If you just need pure happiness, watch him as the eternally optimistic Chris Traeger in ,. Need some non-coronavirus melodrama? Watch him opposite Calista Flockhart as the dreamy Robert McCallister in ,. The possibilities are endless; there are OG ‘80s movies like , and ,and there’s,even a Rob Lowe show on network TV right now called , , Depends on your Rob Lowe movie or TV show of choice,For the past week, I’ve been curling up with a glass of wine (and sometimes Chinese takeout) and hanging with some new friends of mine: Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda. Yes, I’m a little late to the game, but honestly, this is the perfect time to watch a show portraying a warm NYC in the late ‘90s. Central Park in bloom, not a subway to be seen — or even mentioned — the women attend great clubs and fancy meals: all things that are far from the current state of NYC (let alone my experience of NYC for the six years I’ve lived here). And if that wasn’t dreamy enough, there are landline phones! They weren’t constantly getting news updates on a 1998 ,, the dream. , ,The days of extreme vampire hype are over, but this has long remained one of my guilty pleasures. The acting is cheesy, the style is very dated (the show’s first episode aired in 2009), and the fashion is a not-so-welcome blast from the past, but all of this only adds to the charm. With a whopping 171 episodes over eight seasons, this show is certainly a time commitment and very suited for working from home. It doesn’t matter how many times I’ve seen it, the storyline sucks me in every time. Elena Gilbert is a character I love to hate, but she really encapsulates what it’s like to grow up in the face of tragedy (after tragedy, after tragedy, after tragedy). , is truly a story of grief, friendship, love, and monsters. , ,Sometimes, you just need more cat content. Well, the truth is, you , need more cat content. , is one of my favorite films to watch. It’s about seven street cats who live in Istanbul and wander freely around the city, making connections with the people and communities around them. Meet Duman, or “The Gentleman,” who made friends with the owners of a fancy deli. Then there’s Aslan Parcasi, or “The Hunter,” who lives at a famous fish restaurant. Every cat has a different personality, and it’s lovely to watch. But even better is seeing the compassion people have for them. I highly recommend watching this with a package of Oreos and a kitty by your side. , ,, ,, ,Pandemics are scary. Murder is, arguably, less scary — especially when murder comes in the form of witches, haunted carnivals, ‘80s camp slashers, and an actual murder house. ,used to stream on Netflix, but then FX’s deal with Netflix seemed to come to an end, and it disappeared. Now, thanks to FX’s new “FX on Hulu” hub, every season is available to watch. If a good portion of us are going to be working from home for the foreseeable future, we need shows that we can binge throughout the day. ,is campy and perfect. Plus, Evan Peters... need I say more? I’d recommend starting with Murder House (the first season) and then jumping around the seasons to meet your fancies. My personal favorite is still ,’s second season, but the third season has Stevie Nicks. Again, I ask: need I say more? , , ,I grew up watching procedurals on sick days. Bad cold? ,. Flu got you down? ,. Have to stay home for an uncertain but lengthy amount of time? ,. The nice thing about procedurals is they don’t take much brainpower. You can probably guess who did it about 20 minutes into the episode! And since they all tend to blend together at some point, it’s the perfect background show to have on throughout the day when you’re working from home and pretending to pay attention in video meetings. There are a number of ,series to choose from, but ,is my favorite. —Julia, ,Whether people want to accept it, ,is the pinnacle of American pop culture. This is a family that went from being B-list celebrities, thanks to their father who helped another lawyer in OJ Simpson’s trial, to arguably the face of new American celebrity in the mid-aughts. Early seasons of ,are a bizarre time capsule. Like procedurals, reality TV requires no thinking, and it’s impossible not to get caught up in. If you ever thought, “I should see what the hype is all about,” now’s the time. ,is ridiculously addicting, and, at the heart of it, the show is a story about sisterhood that really comes through as they become the influencers we know them as today. ,A quick little fact about me: I love teen dramas. Anything that’s clearly inspired by John Hughes movies immediately has me invested. Teen dramas are hit or miss. They start off great but go off the rails (,), they’re classic WB or CW shows (,), or they just miss the mark (,). Lately, Netflix has ushered in a new era of great teen storytelling. There’s the Spanish show about wealthy teens hooking up and killing each other (,, which I would also recommend if you need a new show), post-apocalyptic comedies (,, also worth your time), or bizarre series based on a warped sense of dark humor I devour every time (,, easily another top recommendation). ,is my favorite show in recent memory. The soundtrack slaps, the cast is charming, the storyline is sensational, and, perhaps best of all, it takes three hours to watch it in its entirety. The show is about an angsty teen with superpowers that all ties back to a possible government cover-up that her late father was involved in, and it’s better than it has any right to be. Seriously, make time for this one — it’s so worth it. ,Sometimes, you just need to tune out all of the chaos in the world and watch an animated Disney movie. When people think of animated Disney films, they most likely think of classics like ,, ,, and ,. But there’s one animated Disney film that was released in the mid-’90s that I feel is the most underrated film of that decade: ,. ,It’s a heartwarming story that focuses on the importance of family, unconditional love, and seizing your moment. Also, did I mention how amazing its soundtrack is? ,You may not be able to live your normal life, but that doesn’t mean you can’t live vicariously through others. , is just about the most laid-back reality show there is. It’s about six young Japanese people who are put together in a house, and they mostly just live their life. There are no challenges, and no one forms alliances. Yes, there’s romance and the occasional drama, but there’s also genuine friendship and people trying to help each other out. In one early episode, the house has a meeting because they’re worried that a budding baseball player is slacking off too much. The biggest , drama to date involves someone eating a steak that wasn’t theirs. Mostly, though, you’re watching awkward first dates and young people struggling to find their true passion. When someone feels their time on the show has come to an end, they simply leave, and another 20-something takes their place. The show is slow-paced yet strangely engrossing, and it’s anchored by a group of hilarious hosts who dissect each episode at various points. The best part: if you haven’t watched it yet, there’s a lot to dig into, with four seasons set everywhere from Tokyo to Hawaii. , ,There’s something extremely comforting to me about a British mystery series. The best ones feature a quirky detective / police officer / lawyer in an interesting, often scenic setting solving mysteries by interrogating lots of suspicious people with interesting accents. Even those series that try to be more gritty are usually reassuring, as the protagonist does their best to act ethically while bringing justice to the world. My personal favorites are ,, which features a middle-aged, grumpy, brilliant police detective in rural northeast England, and ,, in which a smart, pushy private detective solves mysteries in 1920s Australia (okay, Australia’s not Britain, but what the hell) while dressing fabulously and inviting good-looking witnesses into her bed. One hint: if you want to understand what everyone is saying, keep the closed captions on. , ,“Take car. Go to mum’s. Kill Phil, grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over. How’s that for a slice of fried gold?”,(Note: probably don’t go to The Winchester, given that large public gatherings at places like bars may not be the best idea right now.) , ",in the era of social

95,"New trailers: Artemis Fowl, Connected, Antebellum, and more",2020-03-07,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I spent last week watching through the new ,, Hulu’s adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel (and, more importantly, an update to the much-loved John Cusack film). The show was largely shot around where I live, so it was kind of just cool looking out for places I know. Shout out to my local pizza shop for the brief cameo.,Something that I kept thinking about while watching the new series is how much has changed since the movie came out. Where knowing endless music trivia was once the realm of passionate nerds, it’s now weirdly commonplace thanks to the internet. You can’t really write a cool conversation about some niche genre because chances are a wide swath of people already know everything about it. That makes the whole conceit a little harder to pull off.,It’s also possible that there’s just a specific audience for this story, and that’s an audience of people coming up alongside the artists being referenced and still learning everything about music themselves. Looking back at some clips of the 2000 film, nearly all of the musical references I caught were fairly mainstream — stuff I easily recognize now, but would have been clueless to as a teenager. I still love the vibe of ,, I just don’t know that it can be recreated once you’ve already been there.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,After an extended delay (the first trailer for this movie came out in 2018), Disney is finally putting out its adaptation of the 2000s book series ,. This trailer flashes through tons of shiny-looking sequences that suggest there’ll be plenty to gawk at, even if some core elements of the story look a little goofy (apparently a lot has been changed from the books, and ,).

The Sharon Van Etten song that scores the trailer certainly helps you feel something fast, but I think this movie would look like a super emotional coming of age story even without it. The film comes out March 13th.,A new documentary is coming up about jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald, featuring interviews with Smokey Robinson, Norma Miller, and Fitzgerald’s son, among others. It comes to theaters starting April 3rd.,This starts out looking like a tired rom-com, but it quickly turns into something a lot more interesting: a story about two teenage girls becoming friends in spite of the guy who comes between them. It comes out March 27th.,Mark Ruffalo stars in HBO’s adaptation of the Wally Lamb novel,. I hadn’t heard of the book before now, and all I can say is that it sounds exceptionally dramatic and seems to have way too much going on. The limited-series adaptation starts April 27th.,Warner Bros. has a new take on Scooby-Doo on the way that looks pretty... fine. It’s a kids movie through and through, but I’ll give it that the Netflix jokes in the middle are pretty good.

96,Ashly Burch saves video games by making fun of them,2020-03-13,Joshua Rivera,"isn’t just ,, but , connecting an older, weirder era of its culture to the more mainstream world of workplace comedies. Few people on the show exemplify this more than Ashly Burch, a writer on , who also plays Rachel, a wide-eyed game tester for the studio that makes the show’s eponymous game. ,Anyone watching , with more than a passing interest in games will recognize Burch’s name immediately — she’s spent the last decade as one of the industry’s most prominent voice actors, starring as Aloy in , and Chloe Price in ,. Older heads know her from ,, the long-running (and still funny) web series she made with her brother, writer Anthony Burch. As a writer for , — where she’s currently in the writer’s room for the second season — Burch is one of the show’s most experienced voices when it comes to the world of video games. ,This puts her in a uniquely insightful position when it comes to the ways the show skewers the games industry’s problems with diversity, sexism, and how quickly video game players will take anything you give them and use it to make a penis. ,: It feels kind of surreal to me because I’m a lifelong gamer and I always wanted to be a voice actor and I never, ever would have guessed that there would be a sitcom on a major streaming service about a game company. The business has been seen as so niche for so long. So it’s something that really legitimizes the games industry — not that it really needed that, it’s a multibillion-dollar industry — but it’s still been seen as niche for a long time. We were the kids playing ,and ,and no one knew what the hell we were talking about, and now there’s this show on Apple with an Oscar winner about a games studio!,I just found it exciting to have an outlet to talk about the industry. Because we have those conversations within the industry itself, with devs or with other voice actors. But it’s really cool and sort of fascinating to be something of an ambassador for the industry within the context of the writer’s room, and then also getting sort of the feedback and perspectives of some of the writers who maybe weren’t as familiar. ,I started doing web series with my brother over a decade ago, and that’s kind of how I first started getting into video games [for work], through video game sketch comedy. After that I did voice acting, and then I’ve given talks at different conventions and stuff about the industry, or the culture — so I’ve thought a lot about the industry from different angles for a long time. So it was just interesting and a lot of fun to funnel that knowledge into the context of the show. And to depict games in all of its flaws and all of its grandeur. To show the ugly side but also the beautiful side of games.,Because both exist. It’s a massive industry and it’s an amalgamation of a lot of different types of people, so you’re going to get people that are very toxic and very destructive, and then you’re going to get people that are lovely and love games and put good into the world through that love. I feel like we were able to give a complete picture of the industry, which I’m very grateful for and excited by. ,What I mostly find, honestly, is that people mostly don’t know a ton about the industry. I’ve been a voice actor for a long time, and over that time period, you know, you go to parties, people ask you what you do, I’ll say I’m a voice actor for games, mostly, and their response has more or less remained consistent, which is just confusion. Because, you know, like, Mario! “,They don’t realize that there are so many games with these sweeping epic stories that are just as compelling as any movie or TV show that you’ve seen. So mostly I think it’s been a lack of understanding, which isn’t malicious. It’s just, if you don’t play games, you don’t know! So what I think is awesome about , is that we’re getting the opportunity to present a holistic narrative of the industry and showcase that games are more than just Mario or more than just ,. And that they have a life or community all their own. To me that’s exciting. ,I think it’s probably changing, but I also think that a lot of people just know the broad highlights, they know about games their kids play, or they know about,. And so I think having a show like this just demonstrates a side to this world that people don’t often get to see, and you get to show that these folks are not tremendously that different. It’s not substantially different from a normal workplace, it’s got the same sort of problems. ,There’s a normalization that happens there, which is cool — and then getting to showcase the ways that it , different. Like, in the show when we talk about TTP*, that’s a real thing! [laughs] It’s a real thing that someone from Ubisoft told us about, and that is a complication that is , to games! You know, I don’t think accountants are having to worry about TTP. [laughs],*,Mythic Quest, ,I actually had not heard about it before the show! I hadn’t heard about it until Jason Altman, who works for Ubisoft, he was in the room a lot, and he told us about TTP. I think I, you know, assumed that I have enough of a knowledge of the gamer base to know that yes, they’re going to find a way to teabag someone, they’re going to find a way to make a penis — these things are known. But I did not realize there was an acronym that people used in gaming [laughs].,[Laughs] But sometimes in a good way! Sometimes in a great way. ,I think it would’ve been a huge omission to not talk about that on the show. It has been a problem, it continues to be a problem. We’ve gotten better, I think, but we still have a long way to go. I spoke to a friend recently who is a female programmer, and she said she literally had what happened to Michelle in that episode happen to her, which is that her company brought in a Girls Who Code group as a PR move to talk to her, and she didn’t sugarcoat it. She said, “This is a difficult place to work, and I feel undervalued.” She just kinda went , and it came out!,I am so glad and excited and grateful that Rob McElhenney and Megan Ganz and David Hornsby — that was their M.O. from the beginning: let’s showcase this world, let’s show all of it. You know? The good, the bad. And obviously we don’t want to make the whole show about Gamergate because the whole industry isn’t about Gamergate, but to not have acknowledged this disparity and the problems that women face in games, it would have been a huge omission. ,And I feel like we were able to tackle it in a way that was still funny and thought-provoking. I’m horrified that my friend went through this, but it was affirming that it resonated so much. That she saw that scene and was like, “That was me,” you know? Because it means we’re touching on things really true. ,I think I’ve seen a shift. Obviously the big event was Gamergate, and even though it was such a nightmare, and so harrowing for so many women and people of color during that time, the one silver lining I think was that the majority of developers came down on the side of “this sort of toxicity is unacceptable.” And rather than seeing a bunch of companies kowtowing to the whims of this very vocal minority, you saw, I think, an influx of characters that represented a larger player base. You saw female leads in major franchises and options for people of color in multiplayer games. I think you just saw a shift, and I think there’s no question after that — this is an environment that has a lot of toxicity in it, but also an acknowledgment that we don’t want that to be who we are. ,So the fallout from that — people were made aware how deep the problem went, and a shift happened after that. It’s the beginning of a good idea. We need to keep moving in that direction. ,Representation in games has improved over the years, I think that’s indisputable. I remember playing ,when I was younger, and the representation of women in that game is awful! Now you have Ellie in , or Aloy in ,. It’s different now. But I think the thing we need to keep pushing for is representation on the other side, in game dev. More game devs of color, LGBTQ game devs, female game devs. And continuing to push forward and make space for more diverse voices. ,But I do think that when the industry was confronted with that choice — do you want to continue on the path you always have, or are we going to address this toxicity? — this problem that has been bubbling under the surface of our industry, I do think that they chose the latter, for the most part. Obviously, things are not fixed fully. But what you see is an increase in those types of conversations. There are several prominent companies that have had sexual harassment issues that are being worked through now, and not all the solutions are perfect. But, at least in my view, we are making progress. That doesn’t mean we should rest on our laurels, but at least there seems to be a trajectory in the right direction. ,Oh yeah! They’re still , fun. I haven’t ever been a type of person who is like, “Because I’m writing on a comedy, I can’t watch comedy.” I don’t really have that experience. What’s so cool to me about games is how they still surprise me. I played ,over the holiday break, and that game blew my mind! It was so well-designed... I loved it. And I never would have imagined a game like that would exist — I mean, the short pitch is that you’re an insurance adjuster in the 1800s trying to figure out what happened to a ship! [laughs] Not the most exciting log line, but it’s such a compelling game. So to me it’s really cool to have been in the industry for this long, and to see where games started when I was a kid and before that, and now where we are. ,I do sometimes think that because we perpetually feel like the underdog, that there’s the feeling that , — that dampens people’s desires to take risks. I do wonder what our industry would look like if we just sort of felt like we had arrived, and we didn’t have to keep vying for cultural acceptance or cultural relevance. I feel like we would get to see different games. And I’m excited for that, I want that day to come.

minority you saw i think an influx of characters that represented a larger player base you saw female leads in major franchises and options for people of color in multiplayer games i think you just saw a shift and i think there s no question after that this is an environment that has a lot of toxicity in it but also an acknowledgment that we don t want that to be who we are so the fallout from that people were made aware how deep the problem went and a shift happened after that it s the beginning of a good idea we need to keep moving in that direction representation in games has improved over the years i think that s indisputable i remember playing when i was younger and the representation of women in that game is awful now you have ellie in or aloy in it s different now but i think the thing we need to keep pushing for is representation on the other side in game dev more game devs of color lgbtq game devs female game devs and continuing to push forward and make space for more diverse voices but i do think that when the industry was confronted with that choice do you want to continue on the path you always have or are we going to address this toxicity this problem that has been bubbling under the surface of our industry i do think that they chose the latter for the most part obviously things are not fixed fully but what you see is an increase in those types of conversations there are several prominent companies that have had sexual harassment issues that are being worked through now and not all the solutions are perfect but at least in my view we are making progress that doesn t mean we should rest on our laurels but at least there seems to be a trajectory in the right direction oh yeah they re still fun i haven t ever been a type of person who is like because i m writing on a comedy i can t watch comedy i don t really have that experience what s so cool to me about games is how they still surprise me i played over the holiday break and that game blew my mind it was so well designed i loved it and i never would have imagined a game like that would exist i mean the short pitch is that you re an insurance adjuster in the s trying to figure out what happened to a ship laughs not the most exciting log line but it s such a compelling game so to me it s really cool to have been in the industry for this long and to see where games started when i was a kid and before that and now where we are i do sometimes think that because we perpetually feel like the underdog that there s the feeling that that dampens people s desires to take risks i do wonder what our industry would look like if we just sort of felt like we had arrived and we didn t have to keep vying for cultural acceptance or cultural relevance i feel like we would get to see

97,Here’s what NBC’s Peacock streaming service will look like when it launches this July ,2020-01-16,Julia Alexander,"Much like competitors , and , Comcast’s streaming service, Peacock, is going to be entirely reliant on hubs. ,Comcast and NBCUniversal gave an in-depth look at Peacock, which ,, during a special investors event this afternoon at 30 Rock in New York City. There are more than 600 engineers working on the platform, according to Matt Strauss, head of Peacock. The streaming platform is based on the infrastructure that Sky in the UK has used for its own streaming options. ,During the presentation, Strauss walked investors and viewers through the Peacock interface. There are three different areas that subscribers can use when they open the app: channels, trending, and browse. While people are thinking of which option they want to click on, a video will play automatically. It may be the news, or part of a game, or a show, but the idea is that “when you launch it immediately starts playing video, just like TV,” Strauss said. The first image in the gallery below shows an example from a story about , from NBC News Now. ,Once people open up browse, they’ll be able to cycle through the ,. These are broken down into a series of rows similar to Netflix and Disney+. The first two rows are based on shows that people are already watching (“Continue Watching”) and new additions to the Peacock app. ,As viewing habit data is collected, machine learning algorithms will help to make titles that appear on the homepage more personalized. This is how Netflix operates and how the upcoming HBO Max app will operate as well. Emphasis will then be placed on Peacock Originals in subsequent rows, followed with recommendations for existing titles that might be of interest. Peacock will also come with a kids section, like every other streaming app, that is entering the streaming space this year. ,Then there’s the trending section. Peacock will also offer short-form content on a daily basis, including sports highlights, pop culture updates, and shorter news segments. Late-night clips, for example, ,. This includes ,clips that people may have missed — Strauss referred to it as the ability to get rid of the “FOMO” (fear of missing out) you might experience by missing a late-night episode right when it airs. This can help NBCUniversal pull subscribers away from YouTube, where many of these highlights already live after the live airing, and over to Peacock — if everything goes according to plan. ,The third section is channels. NBC is a linear network that wants to remind people how important television is, so Peacock is designed to try to replicate the look of traditional television, Strauss says. Subscribers can pull up a channel guide to scroll through, much like we already do with cable packages now, and see what’s on. They can select from TV shows, news, sports, and movies, as well as look into specific types of content hubs. A ,hub, for example, will also get a “channel” look for people to browse through if they like. ,These are Peacock’s three sections, but there are more product features like curation around specific shows. For instance, fans of NBC’s ,will be able to , and then select from a character like Michael or Jim and watch episodes that are centric to those characters, or are seen as some of the best. There are “beginner” options that give new viewers a chance to figure out the best episodes to watch, too. This is a type of human curation WarnerMedia is using to try to market its upcoming competitor HBO Max. ,More of the Peacock interface, including a look at some of the profile avatar options that will be available, can be seen in the gallery above.

98,Netflix will nearly double the number of French language originals,2020-01-17,Nick Statt,"Netflix today signaled a significant new investment in France with the , and a content roadmap that will see the streaming service nearly double the number of French language originals it has produced so far. Since 2014, Netflix has produced 24 productions in French, including six films and nine television series. But the new plan is to add 20 new productions, and to grow its new corporate presence in Paris consisting of 40 employees to one nearly three times the size. ,Netflix is doing similar expansions across the globe, including elsewhere in Europe and in South America. The company has plans to ,, and last year it ,. It also has offices in England, the Netherlands, and Spain. ,The goal is to diversify its lineup of shows and movies to attract more international customers, especially as growth in its US subscriber base has hit its upper limit and competition from domestic giants like Disney and HBO heats up. Last July, the number of Netflix customers in the US ,. That’s made Netflix’s focus on international expansion more crucial than ever before. ,Netflix has had successful run with foreign language shows, including Spanish language crime thriller hits like ,and , and German language sci-fi show ,. It’s also struck gold with some of its foreign language films, including Oscar nominated ,from Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón. And Netflix is investing heavily in Japanese language content, including securing the ,, as another segment of the streaming wars now includes an , both new and old. ,Yet while expanding its presence in a country like France is arguably good for business, there’s also a legal reason at play. The European Parliament , new regulation regarding Netflix and other streaming services’ presence in the EU that mandates that at least 30 percent of all content carried on the platform be originally produced in the region. Amazon, Netflix, and other companies have until September 2020 to hit that quota. So it’s likely Netflix’s new investments in Germany, Italy, and France will help it do so. ,There’s also Netflix’s somewhat contentious relationship with the French cinema community, after the company’s high-profile showdown with the Cannes Film Festival over contest eligibility requirements. Netflix was , due to its limited theatrical runs, which ran afoul of France’s new rules around local releases and, more broadly, the country’s cultural commitment to cinema as an institution. ,Netflix then pulled out of the festival officially, and it ,. So a new, dedicated presence in Paris and a substantial increase in its investment in local productions may help smooth over that once-soured relationship.

99,Netflix reveals that 76 million people watched at least two minutes of The Witcher,2020-01-21,Chaim Gartenberg,", and so are the first official numbers for Netflix’s latest streaming hit ,. The company says the series was watched by 76 million households, making it the most-watched first season of television ever for Netflix. That’s according to Netflix’s newly unveiled definition of “watched,” which it changed from “watched 70 percent of a single episode of a series” to anyone who “chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes.” ,In explaining the new metric, Netflix notes that the two-minute time period is meant to be “long enough to indicate the choice was intentional,” and it says that it follows similar metrics used by BBC’s iPlayer, YouTube, and ,’ measurements of page views. But the reasoning behind the change is obvious: to juice viewer numbers, with Netflix acknowledging that the new two-minute metric is “about 35% higher on average than the prior metric.” ,To put that number in perspective, two minutes of , is less time than it takes to reach the opening credits of the first episode; the action-packed cold opening is coincidentally two minutes and 16 seconds long. By Netflix’s new metric, anyone who watched just the opening scene of the episode (or 3.2 percent of the total runtime of the episode, which is itself one of eight episodes) is now counted as a view for the entire season. That is also shorter than the amount of time it would take to listen to the hit song “,,” which is also featured in the series.,Still, no matter how you slice it, 76 million households in the first four weeks is a lot of eyes on ,, which Netflix says is “tracking to be our biggest season one TV series ever.” And apparently that’s enough for Netflix to invest in the show for the long haul, as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said , is a “massive new franchise that we’ll develop season after season” in a ,. It was , before season one aired, but Hastings’ comments seem to indicate that it will be a multi-season show.,The company also announced that , from director Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds was viewed by 83 million households in its first four weeks (using the company’s new metric). By comparison, ,, although that doesn’t factor in the 35 percent boost ,’s numbers get from the new two-minute metric.", and so are the first official numbers for netflix s latest streaming hit the company says the series was watched by million households making it the most watched first season of television ever for netflix that s according to netflix s newly unveiled definition of watched which it changed from watched percent of a single episode of a series to anyone who chose to watch and did watch for at least minutes in explaining the new metric netflix notes that the two minute time period is meant to be long enough to indicate the choice was intentional and it says that it follows similar metrics used by bbc s iplayer youtube and measurements of page views but the reasoning behind the change is obvious to juice viewer numbers with netflix acknowledging that the new two minute metric is about higher on average than the prior metric to put that number in perspective two minutes of is less time than it takes to reach the opening credits of the first episode the action packed cold opening is coincidentally two minutes and seconds long by netflix s new metric anyone who watched just the opening scene of the episode or percent of the total runtime of the episode which is itself one of eight episodes is now counted as a view for the entire season that is also shorter than the amount of time it would take to listen to the hit song which is also featured in the series still no matter how you slice it million households in the first four weeks is a lot of eyes on which netflix says is tracking to be our biggest season one tv series ever and apparently that s enough for netflix to invest in the show for the long haul as netflix ceo reed hastings said is a massive new franchise that we ll develop season after season in a it was before season one aired but hastings comments seem to indicate that it will be a multi season show the company also announced that from director michael bay and starring ryan reynolds was viewed by million households in its first four weeks using the company s new metric by comparison although that doesn t factor in the percent boost s numbers get from the new two minute metric ,first official number netflix latest streaming hit company say series watched million household making watched first season television ever netflix according netflix newly unveiled definition watched changed watched percent single episode series anyone chose watch watch least minute explaining new metric netflix note two minute time period meant long enough indicate choice intentional say follows similar metric used bbc iplayer youtube measurement page view reasoning behind change obvious juice viewer number netflix acknowledging new two minute metric higher average prior metric put number perspective two minute le time take reach opening credit first episode action packed cold opening coincidentally two minute second long netflix new metric anyone watched opening scene episode percent total runtime episode one eight episode counted view entire season also shorter amount time would take listen hit song also featured series still matter slice million household first four week lot eye netflix say tracking biggest season one series ever apparently enough netflix invest show long haul netflix ceo reed hastings said massive new franchise develop season season season one aired hastings comment seem indicate multi season show company also announced director michael bay starring ryan reynolds viewed million household first four week using company new metric comparison although factor percent boost number get new two minute metric

The Hooded Justice episode, in particular, was worth watching the entire season for. That hour is perhaps a better encapsulation of the show than the entirety of the show, and it feels so true to the book that it hardly seems like it wasn’t in there in the first place.,I did find the series’ structure a little frustrating, though. Very little actually happens during the timeline of the show — there’s a murder, some flashbacks, and then the ending arrives. Nearly everything important occurred before the show started, and we just have to wait for characters to reveal to us what they’ve already done.

108,"New trailers: Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Netflix’s Taylor Swift documentary, and more",2020-01-25,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I feel like war movies all too often take the form of action films focused on big, broad, and misguided emotions like glory. So it was a wonderful surprise watching ,, one of the first World War II movies I’ve seen in some time that actually has something meaningful to say.,The film does a brilliant job of satirizing the harmful ways people are divided by language and fear. It focuses on a young boy in 1940s Germany who subscribes to Nazi ideology to fit in. It mostly leads to sadness and embarrassment as he begins to realize that everything he’s been told is wrong.,Some of the most revealing moments are big and obvious, like another child being surprised to see that everything he’d learned about Jews was a lie. But the best moments are the quiet ones, when the adults nod along, knowing the lies retold by children are outlandish, but declining to say so. Now as much as ever, it feels like an important issue to explore.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Disney+’s next big , release is a new season of ,, a much-loved animated series that hasn’t had new episodes since 2014. Disney is billing this as the show’s final season, so this isn’t exactly a way to keep Disney+ filled with new , content. But the rest of the show is available to stream, too, which should mean there’s plenty for people who haven’t seen the series yet. The new season debuts February 21st.,It doesn’t really matter whether , is a very good documentary or not — it has intimate access to Taylor Swift, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of her latest album, and promises to explore much of the drama that surrounds her: people are going to watch it one way or another. Netflix picked up the film before it could hit Sundance, and it’ll head to the streaming service January 31st.,Jon Stewart is back with his second film since leaving ,. , looks like a fictionalized spin on the exact type of political nonsense he used to skewer: Democrats desperate to connect, Republicans constantly lying, and pundits going overboard on all of it. The film stars Steve Carell, so it should be fun to see what the two of them make together. It comes out May 29th.,Let’s just start by acknowledging that , is a good title, and that having Alison Brie star is a good decision. From there, I have no idea, and I’ll just say this truly feels like a Netflix movie — not exactly a must see, but very much an O,. It has Brie starring as a lonely woman who seemingly starts to lose it, or be abducted, or probably turn into a horse or something. The film comes out February 7th.,From the name of this movie and still on this trailer, you could easily assume that this is a rom-com about some dapper musician in London. It’s actually a revenge thriller that has Blake Lively stepping into a Bond-like role after being swept up into some conspiracy. It comes out January 31st.,After the international success of ,, one of director Jia Zhangke’s earlier films is getting a US release. His 2010 film ,is a gorgeously shot documentary about China’s modern history, as seen through the last century in Shanghai. It starts to hit US theaters this weekend, starting in New York.,Apple TV Plus has a documentary coming up looking at LGBTQ representation on TV. The eight-hour series includes interviews with Ellen DeGeneres, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow, and quite a few other famous faces, as well as narration by Margaret Cho, Neil Patrick Harris, Lena Waithe, and more. It comes out February 14th., director Dee Rees returns with a film about a journalist who somehow gets tied up in an illegal arms trading scheme. The movie stars Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck and looks like it twists into a socio-political thriller. It comes out February 21st.,Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots star in this strange sci-fi movie about a couple who become trapped in a neighborhood of identical homes and are forced to raise some kind of freaky clone baby. It seems fun, and I’m assuming there’ll be some cutting criticism of suburbia in here. There doesn’t appear to be a release date just yet. (As a side note: At one point, this trailer flashes a huge Rotten Tomatoes logo advertising an 89 percent rating, and while that’s a great score, I still find loudly advertising a B+ to be kind of hilarious. The rating is now at 87 percent.)",i feel like war movies all too often take the form of action films focused on big broad and misguided emotions like glory so it was a wonderful surprise watching one of the first world war ii movies i ve seen in some time that actually has something meaningful to say the film does a brilliant job of satirizing the harmful ways people are divided by language and fear it focuses on a young boy in s germany who subscribes to nazi ideology to fit in it mostly leads to sadness and embarrassment as he begins to realize that everything he s been told is wrong some of the most revealing moments are big and obvious like another child being surprised to see that everything he d learned about jews was a lie but the best moments are the quiet ones when the adults nod along knowing the lies retold by children are outlandish but declining to say so now as much as ever it feels like an important issue to explore check out nine trailers from this week below disney s next big release is a new season of a much loved animated series that hasn t had new episodes since disney is billing this as the show s final season so this isn t exactly a way to keep disney

It’s a collectible figurine that mostly just stands around on your desk or counter, with what looks like few points of articulation to actually pose or play with the figure. ,But much like other Sideshow Collectible products, the life-size Baby Yoda here wins out from other toys with its sheer accuracy to the original, on-screen character. Basically every aspect of the Baby Yoda figure looks nearly perfect compared to the show, right down to the huge eyes and adorable peach fuzz on top of his cute lil’ head. He even has his little toy ball, stolen from one of the control sticks on the Mandalorian’s ship in the show. ,The figure itself measures 16 and a half inches tall, made out of fabric, plastic, and resin.

110,The best anime of 2019,2020-01-31,D. M. Moore,"Hundreds of new anime series come out every year, so it can be difficult to pick out which ones are actually worth watching. With each new anime season, , tries to point fans to interesting new shows via , ,. But it can be hard to judge a series by its cover — or at least by the first few episodes. Some of the best shows each year don’t always make it into those previews. To highlight all of the shows that stood out after a complete watch, we’ve assembled this list of the best new anime of 2019. While it won’t be entirely comprehensive — it only includes series we’ve watched and finished — everything on the list is something we can unequivocally recommend.,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind,A few years back, I wrote a list of recent shows that would be , to anime. The recommendations in it were divided by genre to point people toward avenues they already liked. , has become the show I flatly recommend when asked for suggestions — a series so good it would get the same attention prestige dramas do, if only it were live-action. ,For the animation studio behind the series, WIT, it feels like their capstone work for the decade. It demonstrates everything they learned from making action shows like , and ,, to character dramas such as , and ,. , captures all of that experience and focuses it into a story full of memorable characters, amazingly animated action scenes, and great character drama in the midst of much bigger historical moments. If I had to pick a single best show of the decade, let alone the year, it would be hard not to choose ,.,In , science is a superpower, but it is never used as magic to handwave away something complicated. Instead it relishes in the details, and in the trial-and-error and hypothesizing. At its core, the show is actually about being a scientist: the importance of knowledge, of being inquisitive about the world, and of being ethical in what you use technology to do. It makes science fun by demonstrating how magical it can be, and then shows you how anybody can become a wizard.,is a charming show that forgoes the idea of wish fulfillment. Most shows that feature characters reincarnated in fantasy worlds give them amazing, unique powers. ,instead focuses on an adult librarian taking over the body of Myne, the sickly five-year-old daughter of a poor city guard. It becomes more about the everyday struggles of Myne and her family as she uses her knowledge from our world to try and make books, but also improve the lives of her family and friends without arousing suspicion that she isn’t the real Myne. It’s a show that is ideal for the whole family, or as a way to relax. Even in its most stressful moments, , just feels nice to watch.,It isn’t rare for the anime version of a manga to elevate the source material, as adaptations often rewrite characters or moments of the story with better foresight about later developments. And the addition of sound and animation can expand on and enhance moments in ways just not possible in the comic form. What’s rare about ,’s adaptation is the consistency with which the animation and voice acting enhances the work, not just for specific important scenes, but every episode.,The spectacular action scenes are most noticeable — they’re stylish and easy to follow, even when seemingly impossible things are occurring. In smaller, subtler moments, the animation and voice acting breathe life into the characters and make them more endearing. The best example of this is the way protagonist and titular demon slayer Tanjiro looks genuinely sad when killing a demon. He has genuine pity for them, even though they’re terrible, irredeemable monsters. He has to continue to humanize them, so he can justify continuing to travel with his now-demon sister, looking to cure her. Small characterizations like this speak volumes by making the spectacular climactic moments more emotionally meaningful.,The concept of , a girl starts living with two cousins who both turn into different animals from the Chinese zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex — makes it sound like a comedy romance series in the vein of ,. But , isn’t so lighthearted. It’s more of an emotional gut-punch, episode after episode, as it reveals the terrible things that have happened to each of the characters. They’re never quite what you expect them to be.,But the show isn’t all sadness. It’s an amazingly hopeful story about finding acceptance, finding a family, and working through issues — not with quick solutions, but through sustained care. It finds a great balance between drama, romance, and comedy, which makes those devastating moments land particularly hard., is stressful, hilarious, awkward, heartwarming, melodramatic, cringeworthy, and absolutely brilliant. The show follows the five girls of a high school literature club as they collectively start thinking about sex and adult relationships for the first time. They’re all individually attempting to figure out their feelings and sexuality, and their stories interconnect as they collectively support (and sometimes impede) each other., in some ways is similar to a show like ,, except without the focus on nostalgia and cringe humor. Instead, the show goes for drama with dashes of comedy. It ranges from more lighthearted, cute romantic fare to frank discussions and storylines about queer romance, teen pregnancy, and possibly inappropriate (and sometimes , inappropriate) relationships with adults. It’s a testament to the writing that it manages to deftly navigate tricky subject matter without being problematic or preachy., is a show about Karou, a young single office worker, and the strange lazy bear Rilakkuma who comes to live in her apartment. While Rilakkuma is something of a freeloader, he effectively earns his place in the apartment by teaching Kaoru how to relax from the stresses of her work and relative lack of social life, by finding enjoyment in everyday things. That makes it an incredibly relaxing show. And the amazing stop-motion animation work adds a charming tactility. ,, which makes it marvelously smooth and lively.,The second season of , feels as though there wasn’t a three-year break after the first season. The show continues to be an amazing animation showcase, and watching it often feels like the animators at Bones, the studio that animated both seasons, are showing off and having ,. But what makes both seasons great is the sense of humor and heart on display.,This new season goes to some darker places than the first season. It’s less focused on testing the incredible psychic powers of middle-schooler Mob and more focused on testing his empathy and maturity as he grows up and becomes a person rather than an ultra-powerful psychic force of nature. Even with the darker tone and themes, a wonderful sense of absurdity and humor still grounds the whole series and keeps it from losing its relatability.,Some anime series start off with such strange conceits that they either completely put the audience off or become utterly captivating to understand. , is that sort of show. It follows three middle school boys who get turned into mythical creatures called kappas. They’ll only become human again if they steal a fictional desire-organ from inside the butt of a spirit monster that’s magically stealing items from the city to serve an evil empire of otters.,The real crux of the show, which is hidden beneath all the strange kappa and otter mythological imagery, is personal and human. It’s about exploring the ways we connect with those around us and what those connections mean. It’s a great follow-up for fans who watched , when it hit Netflix and are ,. But despite how weird it can get with all the kappa butt stuff, anyone could enjoy this show. It’ll likely be talked about for years to come, not just for the writing, but for the animation as well.,Early on, , feels like it’s writing a check it has no chance of being able to cash. It seems unlikely we’ll get any significant character development for the 10 different main characters, and their transition from not even amateur runners to one of the top college-marathon teams in Japan seems like it would be fantastical at worst and dubious at best.,Yet, over the course of its 23 episodes, the series presents a convincing story by being less about the sport than about these college students figuring out their lives in the present and future. The running acts as a constant that forces them all to interact, confronting issues in their lives while coming together as a group. This all climaxes in the show’s final episodes: as they run their section of a competitive two-day relay, they reflect on everything that’s happened. The ending only works because of how much the audience knows and cares about the characters, having seen so much of what they’ve gone through.,’s anime adaption is incredibly faithful, but it’s also a fascinating interpretation of the source material about the oldest kids at a secluded orphanage learning that they are actually being raised as food for demons. The manga is fundamentally more of a thriller, while the anime takes on a more horror-like quality. It’s not because they changed anything in the text of the work; it’s because of the way , Mamoru Kanbe visually approached it. Conversations as the kids secretly plan or try to work out what new information they have, are shot in an almost voyeuristic fashion, like the camera is spying on them from around a dark corner. The style adds to the creeping dread of these scenes in a way that isn’t found in the manga.,Even with all that, Emma, who is effectively the lead protagonist, is a breath of fresh air. She exudes a caring and optimism that serve as the driving force for keeping the characters moving forward, while affecting the way they think about approaching problems. She’s never presented as too naïve or not smart enough to understand her dire situation, though, which keeps the show from getting too dark or despairing to enjoy.,initially looks like it’s going to be a wish-fulfillment power fantasy. It’s about a middle-aged Tokyo man who dies while protecting his co-worker from being stabbed. But before completely dying, he awakens in a fantasy world as a low-level slime monster in a cave. Thanks to some strange abilities given to him as part of his transference to this fantasy world, he’s able to absorb items and creatures, allowing him to use and combine their abilities. After befriending a powerful dragon and receiving its blessing, he sets out to learn more about the new world he’s a part of.,The subsequent story could just be about him using his cool new powers in a fantasy world to get everything he ever wanted. Instead, the show is full of empathy. Rimuru is incredibly overpowered, but they understand that while they are possibly indestructible, others aren’t. So they end up using that power like a well-meaning middle manager, knowing how to delegate, and when and how to correctly protect and support others. This all adds a charm to the show, as the drama and story becomes less about Rimuru and more about those around them., has the intensity and mind games of ,, except it’s a bizarre rom-com about two people who like each other and are trying to get the other one to admit it first. Kaguya is vice president of the student council at a prestigious private school and heiress of a rich and powerful family. Student council president Miyuki is from a less auspicious family but is one of the most popular students at school. ,The concept is an interesting twist on a high school rom-com, but that alone isn’t enough to put it on this list. The show’s animation adds so much to the tension and emotional stakes of each scene, with incredibly stylized shots and exceptionally well-animated moments. These shots often elevate the absurdity of the dramatic confrontations, which are comedically great when you remember how trivially stupid the stakes are here, with both characters scheming to get the other person to ask them out. This isn’t a will they / won’t they show. It seems obvious that they’ll eventually come together. It’s just about watching the bizarre antics as these two would-be lovers stumble over their pride.,From the previews, , gives every indication that it’s going to be a cute show about a guy who adopts a cat. Instead, it’s a humorous, heartfelt show about social anxiety, trauma, and depression. It doesn’t just explore this through the secluded author Subaru, who’s dealing with the sudden death of his parents; it explores the same things with Haru the cat, who has her own issues from trying to take care of her siblings when they were abandoned.,The series shows almost everything from both Subaru and Haru’s perspectives, which helps contextualize Haru’s reactions to what Sabaru sees her do. Mainly, it shows how the growing connection between the two helps them find a better balance in their lives where their issues aren’t a constant impediment. It’s not a flashy show with amazing animation, but it tells a poignant story about mental health with the right amount of humor.,Where to start in talking about , It’s such an odd combination of action, body horror, fashion, and meta-referential musician references. For fans who’ve watched the series since part 1, it might all seem pretty normal now. But coming into this latest series fresh could be jarring. Still, this season, the fifth part of the series, works as a standalone piece since it’s narratively separate from the previous chapters. , turns the show into a story about internal strife in an Italian mafia full of people with ridiculous psychic abilities.,The series is ostensibly built on putting its characters in incredibly melodramatic and increasingly ridiculous situations. For instance, the main crew gets stuck on a train with someone who is trying to kill them with his ability to make people age quickly in enclosed spaces. So they hide in a living room created by a psychic turtle inside its shell. , makes the characters so appealing that wondering how they’ll get out of these situations matters more than the completely incomprehensible nature of their problems., manages to really distill this aspect of the series by offering up a small crew of people the viewers really want to root for. They’re gangsters, but their camaraderie and backstories, which reveal how they came to be so close, make them engaging. So does the constant danger they experience, especially since they usually don’t make it out unscathed. The audience’s constant concern for their safety feels justified. It isn’t just manipulative melodrama without consequences.",hundreds of new anime series come out every year so it can be difficult to pick out which ones are actually worth watching with each new

crew gets stuck on a train with someone who is trying to kill them with his ability to make people age quickly in enclosed spaces so they hide in a living room created by a psychic turtle inside its shell makes the characters so appealing that wondering how they ll get out of these situations matters more than the completely incomprehensible nature of their problems manages to really distill this aspect of the series by offering up a small crew of people the viewers really want to root for they re gangsters but their camaraderie and backstories which reveal how they came to be so close make them engaging so does the constant danger they experience especially since they usually don t make it out unscathed the audience s constant concern for their safety feels justified it isn t just

111,Little America has small ideas about the immigrant experience,2020-01-28,Joshua Rivera,"According to its ,, , is “an anthology of funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring, and surprising stories about the lives of immigrants in the United States.” Its first season, released this month on the streaming service, is a collection of eight half-hour stories about immigrants who are trying to make it in the US. It’s the best show Apple has produced so far, but it’s also the most misguided. ,It almost hurts, considering the talent behind ,. Created by Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Lee Eisenberg, just about every episode is an excellent half-hour of television. Each actor on-screen is wonderful to watch, warm and likable at all times. The array of brown faces in front of and behind the camera is dazzling: Uchenna “Conphidance” Echeazu, Eshan Inamdar, Kemiyondo Coutinho, and Tze Chun are actors and filmmakers from a wide variety of backgrounds. The stories they tell (all based on real life) stop just shy of being saccharine.,The trouble is the framing. Like many immigrant stories, they are about overcoming or confronting nigh-insurmountable hardships. In “The Manager,” protagonist Kabir is 12 years old when his parents are deported, and he must take over the family motel, raising himself and running a business while writing obsessively to the government about his parents being readmitted into the country. He will not see them in person again until he is an adult.  In “The Son,” a gay Syrian man flees his family who reacted violently to discovering his orientation, crossing the border into Jordan in the hopes that he can one day claim asylum in the United States. “The Rock” is about an Iranian father who wants to purchase a home in the US but cannot afford it. Instead, he buys a plot of land with a massive, unremovable rock on it and commits to removing it, one chunk at a time. The house is never built.,Because , positions these stories as “inspiring,” it’s worth thinking about why. ,The idea is that we do not see these people represented very often — people who, in the real world, suffer all manner of prejudice and setbacks because they have dared to live a life in a country that is not made for them, even as it postures as the land of opportunity. ,, and works like it, exist as an act of empathy: look at these people. They just want the same simple things you do. A home, a business, a job, love. There are so many shades to the same story. ,But the exceptional nature of ,’s subjects plays into the idea that immigrants must earn our empathy, earn the right to be in the US, earn the mere chance to find happiness. In the US, stories like these are treated like a guidebook for citizenship if you’re a person of color and “inspiring” fodder for white people who want to believe themselves tolerant.,In another, more equitable pop culture landscape, maybe ,would land better. There is room for stories like these, and it bears repeating: it’s pretty good television! What hurts the series most is its frequent refusal to acknowledge that there are , its characters struggle with such hardship. In ,, coming to the United States to make a life is just ,, and the reasons are irrelevant — when, in fact, they are vital. ,The episodes that rise above this are the ones that show , each character faces the plight they do. “The Son” makes it immediately clear why a gay man must flee his Syrian family. In “The Grand Prize Expo Winners,” a Chinese woman wins a cruise for herself and her children. During their time at sea, her dreams of the American life she has obtained and the dreams her children have after being raised in the US come into quiet conflict. The bittersweet nature of the immigrant experience is made tangible for half an hour. ,These episodes are the exceptions. A good second season of , (which is already on the way) would follow their lead. A better one would ditch our cultural fixation on immigrant struggle porn entirely. ,There is dignity in being unremarkable. A noble life can be lived by those who are not paragons, by people getting by on wages too small in homes that do not fit their families in less-than-desirable neighborhoods. , wants its audience to regard immigrants as fully realized people.

113,"Roku is losing Fox apps just in time for you to miss the Super Bowl, maybe",2020-01-30,Sean Hollister,"If you were hoping to watch the Super Bowl on your Roku TV or set-top box, I hope you weren’t counting on streaming it through Fox’s apps — Roku is pulling all its Fox apps off of the platform, effective Friday, two days before the Big Game.,That might strike you as sudden, considering , that Fox Sports was working hard to bring a 4K HDR stream of the Super Bowl to Roku’s streaming sticks, pucks, and TVs. But minutes ago, Fox Sports removed references to Roku from multiple spots on its Super Bowl website, and we’ve now confirmed with Roku that seven channels in total are leaving... unless Fox and Roku strike a deal.,You see, this isn’t an arbitrary move, or even a technical issue — it’s a carriage dispute between the two companies, Roku tells ,Roku and Fox have a distribution agreement set to expire tomorrow. “We offered Fox an extension... if an agreement is not reached, we’ll be forced to remove the channels,” a company representative says. ,Here’s Fox’s statement, which clearly shows how heated this situation is:,Roku told us that it would be “forced to remove the channels” if an agreement is not reached, but Fox says that’s false; it’s entirely Roku’s decision. Roku declined to answer whether there’s actual contractual language that forces them to remove the channels.,Either way, these are the seven Fox channels that are disappearing, according to Roku:,Note that even if you still have these Fox apps on your Roku, the company says they won’t work anymore starting Friday. ,But there are other ways to stream. “The game will stream free on the NFL app on Roku unless Fox blocks your ability to stream it,” reads ,. And if you’ve got Comcast Xfinity or Spectrum, those Roku apps should also offer a Fox stream. Alternatively, you can sign up for FuboTV, YouTube TV, Sling TV, or Hulu with Live TV, a number of which have free trials if you haven’t previously been a subscriber. A rep says FuboTV may even offer a 4K stream.,But there’s a very good chance you can’t count on Fox’s own Roku apps to bring you the Super Bowl on Sunday, since Fox and Roku are playing hardball.,That may be a surprise to some Roku owners, since this is all that Roku is currently telling them via email — no mention of the game:,We’ll have to wait and see.

114,Google Fiber is dropping its TV package to focus solely on high-speed internet service,2020-02-04,Nick Statt,"Google Fiber announced today that it , to focus solely on providing high-speed internet service. It will still provide the service to existing customers who pay for it, but the company says “customers today just don’t need traditional TV” anymore when so many options are available online through over-the-top TV services and streaming platforms. ,“As of today, Google Fiber will no longer offer a linear TV product to new customers. For our current TV customers, we know you have come to rely on Google Fiber TV and we will continue to provide you with traditional TV service,” the company said in a blog post. “And we’ll be happy to help everyone explore other options to get their favorite programming the way TV is watched now — over the Internet, with the virtually unlimited choice and control online viewing provides.” ,Google says it is partnering with FuboTV, an over-the-top provider that specializes in sports programming. That way, new Fiber customers can sign up for Fubo alongside an internet subscription. Google says this is in addition to YouTube TV, its own pay-TV service that has some similar benefits to Fubo. ,Google Fiber, which exists under the Access division of Google parent company Alphabet, is positioning this as a liberating choice for consumers to take control of their media-viewing destinies. But it’s not quite that simple. The truth is that Google Fiber was forking over huge licensing fees to carry traditional TV channels, including big-name cable and sports networks. ,In many cases, what Google Fiber was paying was not the same as what competitors like Comcast and others pay to bundle traditional cable with internet service, due to legacy deals and vertical integration between internet service providers and cable companies. (For example, Comcast operates both its Xfinity cable and internet service while also owning NBCUniversal.) ,, “the cost of acquiring video content was ‘the single biggest impediment’ to Google Fiber’s wider rollout, a top Google Fiber executive, Milo Medin, told an audience in 2014. Compared with more established service providers, Medin said, Google was paying twice as much for video rights.” ,There are other issues, too. Google Fiber was offering a TV option — specifically an IPTV option and not cable or satellite — particularly so it could entice more traditional double- and triple-play customers in the Midwest and other midsize American cities, where Google Fiber was focusing its efforts early on. But the company has struggled over the past five years to make inroads in those markets as the cost of deploying fiber internet was astronomical and the challenge of beating out incumbents like Comcast became increasingly costly. ,In 2016, Google Fiber , amid a restructuring and a round of layoffs, after the company became a separate business unit under Alphabet proper and no longer existed under the core Google umbrella. (Moving Fiber outside Google meant it had more stringent financial obligations to turn a profit and not excessively waste money.) ,Google Fiber has since experimented with its Webpass subsidiary to try to deliver high-speed internet not through fiber optic cables, but with over-the-air transmission technologies. (In one market Webpass was deployed, Boston, Google eventually ,, too.) The company has also slowed its overall expansion considerably. As it stands today, Google Fiber is only available in 18 markets throughout the US. ,Last year, Google Fiber suffered yet another public defeat after it had to , after attempting a method of fiber installation called “shallow trenching” that would have sped up its deployment time, but that failed to hold up over time due to how close to the surface the cables were lying. Instead of starting over from scratch, Google Fiber decided to end service on April 15th of last year. Google Fiber is now , for botching the whole project. ,So it makes sense that, in 2020, Google Fiber doesn’t quite need a TV service that it pays a fortune for, especially as it’s still working to make its internet service an attractive option for consumers and a financially sound one for its parent company. ",google fiber announced today that it to focus solely on providing high speed internet service it will still provide the service to existing customers who pay for it but the company says customers

115,The Good Place finale is a gentle end to a challenging show,2020-02-03,Joshua Rivera,"For four years, , felt like one of the most radical shows on television. A series that was initially about what happens when the wrong person goes to heaven transformed into a meditation on what it means to be a good person, and how no one is beyond redemption. That it aired during a time where cruelty led to a parade of demoralizing victories in politics and culture made it feel even more miraculous, a kind show for mean times. With its series finale, ,chose not to overstay its welcome, ending gently with a 90-minute conclusion that held no surprises — except, maybe, how disappointing fulfillment can be. ,“Whenever You’re Ready” begins its long goodbye with every conflict in the series resolved in the previous episode. Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, Tahani, Michael, and Janet have arrived in heaven and devised a perfect, equitable afterlife for all humans to go through. Upon death, everyone enters a time of testing and reflection, which they must pass in order to enter The Good Place. Once a person is in, they stay until they’re ready to walk through a door and fade into nothingness.,As the episode unfolds, each character eventually finds fulfillment and decides to leave, one at a time. First are Jason and Tahani, characters who have been underserved by the show for some time now, mostly reduced to one-note jokes. The show makes up for that a little: Jason’s departure is a small fake out; he ends up being stranded outside of the final door for eons because he forgot to give something to Janet. In doing this, he learns the inner peace and patience that makes him attain, inadvertently, the kind of spirituality he pretended to have at the start of the show as a silent monk. ,Tahani decides to not go through the door, instead choosing to try her hand at becoming an afterlife architect — a move that signals a shift in her ambitions, applying them to the service of others instead of herself. It’s a nice ending, but one that underlines a solid two seasons of missed opportunities for the character. ,The finale’s heart, however, is with the character , started with: Eleanor Shellstrop, who still has a few lessons to learn. The first involves letting go and accepting Chidi’s decision to go through the last door. The second is in helping someone else learn to let go, convincing the Middle Place’s sole inhabitant, Mindy St. Claire, to finally give up her post and enter the rebuilt afterlife. Finally, Eleanor guides Michael to the one ending that would make him truly happy: a mortal life.,There are beautiful moments in this. Despite the long-standing criticism of Chidi and Eleanor’s relationship remaining valid — the two have never worked as much as the show believed they did — actors William Jackson Harper and Kristen Bell pour their hearts into their final scene together, with a conversation about oblivion that is life-affirming and not an existential terror. The brief few moments we see of Michael’s human life are wonderfully endearing. It’s all a very nice ending for a very nice show. ,It all feels a little hollow, though. , at its best was often about how being good was ,. It is difficult and prone to going awry; your ideas of what constitutes “good” might not ultimately translate to a net positive in the cosmic balance. This is why, , argued, we need friends — other people who wanted to be good to others as much as you did, and who had different ideas about how to do that. ,Attempting to live a good life often feels like it isn’t rewarding or ultimately worth it, but ,’s best moments showed that you could build a community where it , worth it, an internal dynamic built around justice and fulfillment that, with time and good fortune, might radiate outward and change someone’s life. ,There is uncertainty in this. We don’t really get to know the kind of impact we have, if we make one at all. At the apex of ,’s storytelling prowess — the season 2 finale, “Somewhere Else” — ,the show,dug into this idea, with each character having a second chance at a mortal life. With no memory of her previous life or afterlife, Eleanor tries to live ethically, and it goes poorly. The episode ends with Eleanor nudged in the direction of finding Chidi and her former friends, and fades to black before she gets there. , I loved wasn’t one that trafficked in certainty about anything. It was a show about ,, about a secular faith in living a noble life without the guarantee of a material reward. It showed a cast of chronically selfish people learning to mitigate their selfishness by caring more for each other, even in the face of a cartoonishly elaborate demon bureaucracy that wanted them to believe none of that mattered. It was nice to see them be rewarded in the end. I want to believe they would’ve done it all the same, even if they weren’t.

118,Faze Clan is launching a Quibi reality show to sign its next gaming star,2020-02-04,Nick Statt,"Gaming entertainment and e-sports organization Faze Clan is taking a unique approach to signing who it hopes will become the next big gaming star: a reality show. The Los Angeles-based company has partnered with yet-to-be-released streaming service Quibi to produce ,, a contest that will see six users of the Quibi app compete to be the next signed Faze member. To participate, contestants will need to ,. ,“Utilizing its interactive mobile technology, Quibi — along with key members of the Faze Clan — will open up one potential spot on the Faze Clan team. Then, Quibi subscribers will uniquely be able to submit a video pleading their case for a chance to join the team,” reads the show’s description. “Quibi subscribers will then vote through the Quibi app for the six lucky people that deserve a shot at gamer glory. From there, contestants will travel to the Faze Clan mansion to go through a series of real-life and gaming challenges, until one gamer — selected by Faze — is left standing.”,It’s an interesting concept that hasn’t really been seen in the e-sports industry. Most professional video game players today are scouted either through the top leaderboards and tournaments of popular titles like ,and , or they’re already well-known social media personalities with big followings on Twitch and YouTube. From there, an organization like Faze would sign a contract with the player to bring them onto its roster of talent, which can involve being a content creator or competing as part of an established e-sports team dedicated to a distinct title (in some cases, both).,A reality show approach, however, brings a much more dramatic and Hollywood-esque flair to the process that might appeal to a different type of gaming competitor or online creator. The description for , doesn’t say that potential contestants have to be top-tier in any one game or that they even need to have a substantial social media presence. ,So while it’s safe to say potential contestants will likely need to be avid gamers and probably talented in at least one or more titles, being virtuosic at gaming — like current Faze e-sports players — does not seem like a strict requirement. The selection process also appears to depend heavily on the user-submitted videos and the viewer-centric voting, meaning it could be more about having a dynamic personality than exhibiting impressive gaming skills. ,“Over the past 10 years, Faze Clan has not only contributed to the growth of the gaming lifestyle and the e-sports community, but we have broken barriers and are not afraid to disrupt the status quo,” said Oluwafemi Okusanya, Faze’s head of content, in a statement.  “In 2020, we plan to do the same with content creation and media distribution. The,show represents our next chapter in content creation with our first premium production effort.” ,Like its ,, Faze is as much an entertainment and lifestyle brand as it is a serious e-sports competitor. It maintains six well-funded and talented pro teams across a variety of the industry’s biggest games. That includes a newly minted, Atlanta-based ,League team that just ,. ,But Faze also maintains a growing apparel business and has a massive focus on brand deals, sponsorships, talent management, and professional video creation. A majority of the 85 or so official Faze members are not, in fact, e-sports athletes; instead, they’re content creators and influencers. Even ,. As , in a recent Faze profile last November, the company is “the Dallas Cowboys meets Supreme meets MTV.”  ,In that context, a reality show on a buzzed-about new streaming service like Quibi makes perfect sense for Faze. The company is working with media platform Whistle, which produces sports-related video and other content for various online platforms, to get the show up and running, and the plan is to start the contest with Quibi’s launch on April 6th.

119,Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet is a comedy surprise you can’t miss ,2020-02-07,Joshua Rivera,"Video games are a hard thing to love. The medium rarely translates well outside of its own little island — think of all the bad video game adaptations we’ve seen, or how “video game” is usually used as a shorthand for “shallow” when used to describe stories in other media. Games culture does not advocate for itself terribly well. So it’s natural, then, to cringe when you hear of a show like ,, an Apple TV comedy about a fictional video game studio that produces a ,-esque online game. Will it work out? Will people who know about games like it? Will people who don’t? Is it even funny? You get jaded. But instead of another painful serving of,-style nonsense, , is legitimately good on its own merits, and one of the first big TV surprises of the year.,The nine-episode first season, now streaming on Apple TV Plus, follows Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney), creative director of the wildly popular online role-playing game ,, and his fellow developers as they prepare to release their first big expansion, , There’s Poppi (Charlotte Nicdao), the lead developer; Brad (Danny Pudi), the sociopathic money guy; C.W. Longbottom (F. Murray Abraham), the washed-up fantasy writer; and David (David Hornsby), the co-founder who tries to corral them all — which can be difficult because they all hate each other.,This is why , works, even if you don’t know the first thing about video games. It’s about a bunch of misanthropes working together, with comedy derived from the dark ways their toxic relationships push and pull each other around. You don’t need to know how a studio works to recognize an office hierarchy when you see one, or an egomaniac boss, or a shitty coworker that skates on your hard work. ,But it’s also very interested in video games, and it’s not overly concerned with making them look good or demanding anyone take them seriously. In fact, the show is pretty unsparing. The game studio is beholden to the opinions of a dirtbag teen streamer who rates video games on a five-butthole scale, labor is casually exploited, players are gleefully taken advantage of, and in one of the best episodes, it turns out Nazis really love the game they make. ,What makes , so satisfying is how all of its comedy is steeped in character, not in how video games are inherently goofy or ridiculous (though they often are). Watching it, you can trace lines to the sort of comedies from which it’s descended. , is the easiest connection, as co-creators Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Megan Ganz all come from that show. But there’s also a little bit of , in how the small decisions characters make — adding a shovel to their game, opening up an in-game casino, introducing a big mystery to fans without having any idea what the answer is — spiral out into small hurricanes that can result in a farce on corporate sensitivity panels or the formation of a labor union. ,A video game studio makes for a good workplace comedy in 2020, and not because of the widespread industry sentiment about how it deserves its cultural due after years of economic dominance (Don Draper ,). Instead, it’s the perfect place to get a clear look at what work is increasingly starting to look like now that the robber barons of tech have built their empires: largely behind screens, mostly for the filthy rich, all feeding a digital beast that only exists to further its own existence. ,Video game employees are the lucky ones.

123,BoJack Horseman was a powerful show about addiction and a messy one about celebrity,2020-02-05,Joshua Rivera,"As, progressed through its six seasons, the show’s most obvious punchline didn’t get funnier; it got scarier.,Yes, the cartoon horse was depressed. And an alcoholic. And he hurt the man with cancer. And gave the teens booze. And nearly slept with one. And tanked careers in order to save his own. And left someone to die. But when ,concluded with its final eight episodes, it wasn’t interested in a laugh so much as a reckoning.,BoJack Horseman,Everything finally catches up to BoJack, in a way. A Netflix original about a former sitcom star attempting a comeback while also dealing with addiction and depression, , followed an anthropomorphic horse who continually tried to dull the pain of his previous bad behavior with something worse. As the show grew in scope and fleshed out a large cast of characters, it explored all kinds of ideas and stories, but the two most persistent ones were directly tied to its main character: addiction and the way celebrity fosters and protects toxicity. With its finale, the show finally locks BoJack up (for breaking and entering after a near-fatal bender), following him on a break from his 14-month sentence, which was granted so he can attend his friend and former agent Princess Carolyn’s wedding.,Maybe it seems disingenuous to suggest a show that put its main character in prison for bad behavior is somehow letting him off the hook, but ,’s bittersweet farewell to its protagonist is a goodbye that chooses the parts of the show about addiction and recovery at the expense of those about abuse and power. It’s a decision that comes across as odd when the entire final season was built around taking stock of BoJack’s awful actions throughout the whole series and bringing them to light in a way that mirrors the way real-world bad men have been exposed in recent years.,When reporters piece together BoJack’s complicity in the death of his former child co-star Sarah-Lynn, along with many of his other misdeeds, the quieter life he’s come to find and love — sober, teaching college theater — comes crashing down. He gives a nationally televised interview that initially goes well for him, given our culture’s tendency to favor repentant men over their victims. Goaded by this success, BoJack does a follow-up interview, and this one reveals his pattern of abusive and predatory behavior for all the world to see. , is often overwhelmingly focused on its characters’ interiority — to the point that it had to remind the audience in stark, horrific terms that its protagonist’s selfish actions had real and devastating effects on the people around him. (One of the main ideas behind , was a cautionary tale about identifying with characters like BoJack too much.) In reminding viewers of its very large cast of characters and the ways almost all of them have been hurt or used up by BoJack,— a few to their last breath — season 6 of the show is about as damning as you can get.,Yet, Princess Carolyn’s wedding is a bittersweet finale that reads as strangely fond of BoJack. , isn’t unsympathetic to his victims. By the time the series ends, his former friends have drawn new boundaries around their lives, and it’s not particularly clear if there will be room for BoJack in them when he gets his freedom back. They all are friendly with him, sure, but he’s also presumably haunted by the ghosts of the people who won’t even see him or can’t. ,That guilt is only alluded to in the finale proper, but it’s explicitly given its due in the penultimate episode, “The View From Halfway Down,” a near-death vision of hell or purgatory that traps BoJack in a dinner party with everyone he’s ever hurt. ,’s finale, “Nice While It Lasted,” is mostly preoccupied with how a man who’s made all of these mistakes might go on with his life. ,In the end, it was always a messy idea to marry a story about mental health and addiction to a story about a powerful, abusive celebrity. Power muddies the waters, demanding a specific response when , ultimately wants to contemplate more universal ones. What do you do when you let your demons get the best of you, when you’ve done things that are unforgivable? Can you find redemption? What do you do when you’ve done awful things, and the only answer you know for sure is that life’s a bitch, and you keep living? ,A television show doesn’t owe anyone a moral roadmap for living our lives, or even a particularly moral fictional universe. BoJack can keep getting away with things, and , could probably make compelling TV out of it. (Showrunner Raphael Bob-Waksberg had , on having at least one more season.) The trouble is when , collapses two of its running themes — one of mental health and addiction and the other of power and abuse — into a single conclusion, suggesting that they complement each other when they do not. In the end, , loved BoJack Horseman too much. ,This result — a finale that asks “How does BoJack go on with his life now?”,without really giving a solid answer — is a fitting one for a show that wanted to explore the life of an awful person with unexamined mental health issues and addiction. But for the other ,, the show about a powerful celebrity who was once washed up and finds his way to relevance again through the discarded lives of the people around him, that ambiguity feels too kind. It’s dishonest about the nature of power, which lets people behave with impunity because the rules are different for them. This does not mean redemption and rehabilitation are impossible, but the rules for them, by necessity, are different, too. , never really makes that distinction, and it’s arguably poorer for it.,In this way, , recalls the finale of ,, another show that went long and hard in its final episodes to damn its protagonist, only to bid farewell wistfully as the music played and its hero, while superficially punished, enjoyed one last moment with the life they stole. Perhaps there is honesty in this — life isn’t so neat, and attempts at being good don’t always work out — but I could find a way to wish BoJack, the horse-man all-time screw-up, all the best in his life, even if I didn’t want him in mine any longer. BoJack the TV and movie star? He can rot.

124,Netflix’s Locke and Key mashes up Riverdale and The Haunting of Hill House,2020-02-06,Andrew Webster," is what would happen if you took the brooding teen drama of , and combined it with the all-too-real family tragedy and otherworldly scares of , , ,. That might make Netflix’s latest series sound derivative. But while it shares a similar tone as other shows on the service — , fans will find a lot to enjoy here — ,’s wildly creative premise gives it its own unique flavor. Yes, it’s dark, magical, and dramatic but in a way you’ve never seen before.,The show is based on the decade-old comic series of the same name by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez, and the premise is largely the same. Following the death of her husband, Rendell (Bill Heck), Nina Locke (Darby Stanchfield) packs up her three kids and moves them to an old family home in small-town Massachusetts. That home, called Keyhouse (please don’t dwell too long on the on-the-nose naming conventions) is a sprawling New England estate that also happens to be home to a number of magical keys. Things really pick up when Bode (Jackson Robert Scott), the youngest kid, finds a woman named Dodge trapped in a well on the property who turns out to be some kind of evil demon.,The keys are really — and I’m sorry to say it like this — the key to the whole show. Each has a distinct ability. One can unlock a person’s mind so they can step through a door into a world made up of their thoughts and memories. Another lets people travel anywhere just by unlocking the closest door. One fixes things, one turns people into ghosts, and others control people or trap them in a terrifying mirror world. They have satisfying names like the Anywhere Key and the Head Key. Bode accidentally stumbles onto the keys because they whisper to him; as he explores the house, he can hear them, and once found, he tries to figure out what they do. Eventually, his older siblings join in, and the trio takes control of the keys., is a mystery — actually, it’s a few mysteries, and each intertwines with another. There are the keys themselves, of course: where they came from, why they’re here, what they do. There’s also the murder of the Locke patriarch and, oh yeah, that demon lady living in the well. All of these mysteries are connected in ways I won’t spoil, and they’re layered into a story that’s, at its heart, about family. There’s Nina struggling with alcoholism after the death of her husband, teenagers Tyler (Connor Jessup) and Kinsey (Emilia Jones) trying to fit in at a new high school, and Bode being a small, curious kid surrounded by problems way beyond his age. Throw in the keys, and the result is dark, messy, and intricate.,While all of these elements are prominent, the show has a particularly tight focus on Tyler and Kinsey and the ensuing high school drama that entails. There are subplots about dating and dances, but they don’t feel forced or out of place. Instead, the writing does a great job of connecting everything, whether it’s a new key with horrifying potential or Kinsey figuring out who she wants to go out with. (At one point, she finally starts dating after using the Head Key to remove her fear, so she’s no longer scared to make a move.) The drawback of this focus is that the show doesn’t fully explore the intriguing, deep mythology that’s in the comics. Essentially, the show expands the focus on characters and the expense of lore. For the most part, the trade-off works. It also provides more fruitful ground for future seasons, which will likely depart even further from the source material.,On the surface, , looks like plenty of shows that are already out there. It’s dark and moody, mixing teen angst with lots of magic. But within that familiar framework, it does just enough to stand out. The inventive premise creates the kind of mystery that makes you hit “next episode,” while each new key reveal further expands the magical possibilities. For a show that can feel so familiar, it does a remarkable job of keeping you guessing. The fact that it’s a largely faithful adaptation of an iconic comic series is just a bonus.", is what would happen if you took the brooding teen drama of and combined it with the all too real family

126,"New trailers: Mulan, Spiral, The Jesus Rolls, and more",2020-02-08,Jacob Kastrenakes," wrapped up last week — I won’t get into much detail here (I feel like a ton of people are waiting to watch it when the whole season’s available on Netflix) — but I did want to write briefly about just what a great series it’s been.,One of the things that made ,so great was just how much of a plot it infused into the traditional sitcom formula. Yes, a typical episode involved a core cast of characters dealing with a somewhat predictable set of hijinks, but there was almost always constant forward movement. That pressure made every episode feel fresh and important, and the added tension made the comedy play that much stronger.,One thing I found fascinating about the final episode (again, no spoilers) was how the show almost stepped outside of that structure. It felt more like a coda than a true conclusion (which, arguably, came earlier). That made for a lovely, if also surprisingly relaxed, sendoff and some really sweet moments with its core cast. More than anything else, I really appreciated the show’s dedication to giving Ted Danson truly perfect human lines right until the end.,Check out nine trailers from this week below.,Disney put out a final trailer for , this week, showing off more of its colorful, cleanly shot, and epic battle sequences.

Kevin Hart withdrew after , on his personal Twitter account and related anti-gay stand-up material resurfaced.

129,Runaways finally figures out the show it wants to be — right before it ends ,2019-12-13,Joshua Rivera," could’ve been great. The show’s basic premise, about a group of teens who discover that their parents are all supervillains and run away to fight them, is beautifully on the nose. Teenagers rebelling against parents who are actually evil! Also, there are superpowers and a pet dinosaur? If no one else tries it, ,will. ,Unfortunately, ,, Hulu’s TV series based on the Marvel comic created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, stumbled with the execution almost immediately. Its first two seasons were oddly paced and imbalanced, sapping all momentum from the show by decisions that didn’t end up working out so well — first in choosing to slow down the story so that the eponymous Runaways don’t actually, well, run away until the first season finale, and then in choosing to focus on their parents just as much. (Parents are boring, everyone knows that.),In its third and final 10-episode season, out today, ,goes for broke and resets everything — but slowly. The first half of the season is dedicated to tying up the majority of plot threads introduced over the last two years. The second half barrels headfirst into something new: the show it always should have been. ,It’s a lot like watching the show clean up its own act before it goes off to a bright future in college, one episode at a time. The last season left the cast — teen polymath Alex Wilder, power-goth Nico Minoru, reformed jock Chase Stein, dinosaur owner / intersectional feminist Gertrude Yorkes, super-strong kid sister Molly Hayes, and secret alien Karolina Dean — split up and pretty much beat. Their parents, formerly members of an evil cult of alien worshippers, now possessed by the even-more-evil aliens they worshipped, have captured half the team and imprisoned them in a low-budget version of the Matrix. It’s all part of a scheme to open up a portal to another world and, well, you know what? The show doesn’t really care. ,I can’t stress enough how strange and funny it is to watch ,completely change its mind about its direction mid-season, as its cast gets whisked away to another dimension in order to give the show a hard reset. In a way, it’s remarkable. It’s incredibly rare to see a show address and internalize a critical dressing-down and make a hard pivot for the better, but that’s what ,does. ,The parents and their cult-related schemes are almost entirely dispensed with, only brought back when it makes sense. With their reduced presence, the teens actually get to indulge in some teen drama and weird comic-book-y shenanigans involving alternate dimensions, teen covens, and double-crossing. One of the most frustrating character changes, rewriting Nico Minoru’s character from the teen witch of the comics to someone who just owns an alien staff, is completely retconned. She’s a witch now. Magic is now a confirmed thing on the show. ,It’s so much of a thing, in fact, that the final villain of the season is Morgan le Fay, the sorceress of Arthurian legend (and also a Marvel comics character). Also making appearances are Ty Johnson and Tandy Bowen, the light- and darkness-powered heroes of Marvel’s other doomed-too-soon teen show on Freeform, ,. , final season is a bittersweet watch. For years, the comic it was based on was one of the best points of entry for comic books, more interested in believable characters and fun pacing than any of the normal trappings of superheroics. Its TV adaptation could have been just as refreshing, but too often, it looked like a pale, confused imitation. ,At the very least, it gets to go out with a bang.", could ve been great the show s

131,The Lost finale was the decade’s most underrated ending,2019-12-17,Jay Peters," series finale, “The End,” is my favorite finale of any TV show — but not because it solved all of the show’s many mysteries. It didn’t., was ABC’s smash hit about the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 and the island where they crashed. The show was great at character-driven stories and showing how the island (generally) turned them all into better people, but it did so in an exciting way by making those stories play out among the many mysteries, questions, and curiosities of the island.,Throughout six seasons of these dangling questions, I — like many other fans — was ready for answers. But by the time of the finale, it was becoming clear that we weren’t going to get the mind-melting revelations we were hoping for. , represented, among other things, candidates to replace an immortal being that ruled the island? Hmm. The smoke monster was made when that being threw his brother into a magical cave of light? Uh, okay.,And in the finale, we finally learned that the island kept its mystical energy because... a plug in a pool kept the island’s magical water from draining away. Following season after season of increasingly clever answers to increasingly clever mysteries, seeing the banal reality of a giant drain stopper was something of a letdown.,But I loved the finale anyway. Instead of checking off every box, executive producers Carlton Cuse (who has since created , and Amazon’s , series) and Damon Lindelof (, and HBO’s ,) instead packed the finale with as many unforgettable character-driven moments as they could. And that, in retrospect, is what the show was , the best at the whole time, anyway. Who can forget iconic moments like “,,” the reveal of the show’s ,, and ,?,Ironically enough, the finale made its character moments really shine by paying off , mystery in a huge way. Season 6 played with , trope of flashbacks or flash-forwards by instead presenting flash-,a weird alternate reality where Oceanic Flight 815 didn’t crash. In the flash-sideways, the characters apparently have no knowledge of their connections on the island. The audience doesn’t know what the point of the flash-sideways was — until they reach the series finale. By that time, the audience knows that the show’s characters can “wake up” from the flash-sideways and suddenly recollect their lives on the island.,These sepia-toned recollections are powerful flashes of each character’s most memorable plots throughout the entire show, usually with their one true love, and each is backed by the very best of Michael Giacchino’s amazing soundtrack. The finale gives us ,: , how they rekindled their relationship and eventually died together. , how they fell in love. , their amazing, wonderful, best-ever relationship. ,These moments of recollection in the finale were beautiful when I first watched the final episode live in May 2010. But when I recently rewatched the episode, sitting next to the person I would marry six days later, these scenes , me. I cried at every single one.,I’ve come to realize that the point of the finale, and perhaps all of ,, wasn’t to get answers to the plot questions that got many of us to care about the show in the first place. (That is something I also think is true about most of the recent enduring prestige TV dramas, including ,, ,, and, yes, even ,.) The point was to deliberately show that the real journey, and I mean this with no irony, was the friends the characters made along the way — and maybe that’s what the journeys of our real lives are,

132,"No matter how Watchmen ends, it’s already done more than enough",2019-12-14,Joshua Rivera,"It was the Rorschach mask in the glove box that sold me. ,, HBO’s sequel / reinvention of the comic of the same name by Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore, came out the gate swinging with a prologue set during the 1921 Tulsa race riot. But it was the next scene that got me fully on board, one that showed that Rorschach, the original comic’s most popular character, was a hero to white supremacists. It felt transgressive but also right — and then I flipped back to the comic and you know what? It ,right.

There’s time travel, killer action, a deep conspiracy, and a great love story. There’s a lot there — maybe too much to end well. And you know what? If it doesn’t, that’s fine.,In 2019, , (the comic) was arguably more trouble than it’s worth. As a work of comics, it’s as good as everyone says, a rich reading experience that’s held up for decades. As a cultural touchstone, however, it’s been a disaster, inspiring a whole generation of creators and fans who were more fascinated in its “realistic” take on superheroes than its pervasive ideas about a world marching toward its own annihilation, and the cultural attitudes that brought it to the brink of doomsday. ,One way to measure the success of HBO’s , has been how satisfying it is to watch the show completely rewrite its source material, trading its anxieties for current ones, taking its criticisms of superhero fiction and extending it further to make it a criticism of power and the whiteness of that power. In this new ,, superheroes aren’t just the purview of thrill-seekers and proto-fascists. They’re how white supremacy digs its roots deeper into the culture: not just by seizing power, but also by seizing our fantasies.

Doctor Manhattan, the godlike superhuman, is reinvented under the guise of Cal Abar, a black man living in Oklahoma. The villain of the show is a folksy white senator, friendly and seemingly well-intentioned, secretly leading a cabal of racists who want to help him steal the powers of a god, simply because he feels entitled to take them. ,The ,comics are celebrated because they challenged popular notions about superheroes and comics, changing our perceptions of what they could be.

133,"New trailers: Wonder Woman 1984, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, In the Heights, and more",2019-12-14,Jacob Kastrenakes,"I recently saw ,, Edward Norton’s adaptation of the two-decade-old Jonathan Lethem novel about a private investigator with Tourette syndrome. I’ve never read the book, but from what I gather, the movie is an almost complete departure from the text outside of its core conceit.,Departing from the book isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Norton’s instinct to play up the noir elements makes for a fun, slapstick twist on the genre at points, and 1950s New York is a lot of fun to explore.,But the movie also feels a little hollowed out. Norton basically jams a tour through , (the famously thorough 1975 biography of Robert Moses, which has nothing to do with ,) into the core of his adaptation, without much to say about it.

I really think only one of these, the latter, makes for good seasons of the show — and there have been some excellent seasons. But I thought season 9 went too far in the “obnoxious Larry” direction, and it seems like season 10 is headed that way, too. I hope not, because , can be such a fun show to watch when it’s at its best. The new season starts January 19th.,I didn’t include an earlier trailer for , because the movie seems to be hitting a lot of very familiar horror beats. But you know, it seems to be doing a good job of it, too. The movie looks quiet and creepy, and who doesn’t love seeing a pained Jesse Plemons say something that he obviously knows more about than he’s letting on. The movie comes out April 17th.,I didn’t think this was a real movie when I first started seeing trailers floating around for it, because it just seems so much like a weird little joke Ryan Reynolds would make. But no... this is a movie. A real, complete movie about, basically, an NPC in a video game who becomes a real player, or something like that. The premise is strange and a little nonsensical. The entire thing is weird, really. I’m mostly sharing this out of morbid fascination. It’s coming to theaters? I don’t believe it.

the obnoxious larry direction and it seems like season is headed that way too i hope not because can be such a fun show to watch when it s at its best the new season starts january th i didn t include an earlier trailer for because the movie seems to be hitting a lot of very familiar horror beats but you know it seems to be doing a good job of it too the movie looks quiet and creepy and who doesn t love seeing a pained jesse plemons say something that he obviously knows more about than he s letting on the movie comes out april th i didn t think this was a real movie when i first started seeing trailers floating around for it because it just seems so much like a weird little joke ryan reynolds would make but no this is a movie a real complete movie about basically an npc in a video game who becomes a real player or something like that the premise is strange and a little nonsensical the entire thing is weird really i m mostly sharing this out of morbid fascination it s coming to theaters

135,"Netflix’s stalker thriller You returns for a second season, and it kills",2019-12-23,Joshua Rivera,"Perhaps the most deliciously satisfying thing about ,is that it began as a Lifetime show. It seemed to fit right in, too — based on the novel of the same name by Caroline Kepnes, the show followed bookseller Joe Goldberg as he began to stalk a woman named Beck, gradually inserting himself more and more into her life as he attempted to woo her and isolate her from all her friends. You know. Lifetime stuff. ,After a killer-but-little-watched first season, the show migrated to Netflix, where it will maybe find the audience it deserves — and yes, it does deserve it. Because ,masquerades as trashy thriller in order to get you to underestimate it — dismiss it, even — while it goes to work subverting every assumption you had about it. It’s a trick that doesn’t seem repeatable, but in ,’s second season, out December 26th, the show somehow pulls it off.,The second season of , is a bit of a reset. ,’s first season was fairly conclusive (I’ll be vague to preserve the fun for those who haven’t seen it), so in its second season, Joe — trying to start over after the first season’s events in New York — moves to LA, a place he hates, but also a place no one knows him. ,After briefly entertaining the notion of being a changed man who has left his stalking ways behind, Joe quickly falls into his old patterns. This time, his obsession is a woman named Love, his coworker at the hybrid wellness store / bookshop Anavrin. (Spell it backward and groan with me.),At first, it seems like , is simply repeating itself, playing the same beats with a different woman in Joe’s sights. To a certain extent, that’s true — there’s even a running subplot about a troubled woman who lives next door with a plucky kid Joe becomes protective of, a mirror image of season 1 — but as the twists pile up, the reflection comes across as intentional and effective. And it’s not like there aren’t new things happening here. Love’s codependent relationship with her brother takes , into some unexpected places, and the show’s new setting gives it new arenas for exploring toxic masculinity. There’s also some leftover threads from last season that turn the pressure up. And finally, harkening back to a similar moment in season 1, when the show finally breaks free of Joe’s perspective to let the audience in on Love’s side of the story, things , take a turn. ,What makes , subversive, brilliant television is delightfully simple: Joe is an idiot. Sure, he reads a lot of books and, as an observer of people, is pretty deft at manipulating the fundamental selfishness of others. But as a criminal? He’s hilariously incompetent. This is where , twists the knife you never knew it slipped in, because the point of the show is that he doesn’t , to be good at any of this. , makes it easy to condemn Joe because we are privy to his private moments and thoughts, the ways he justifies every overreach and horrible action. But to everyone else? He’s just a man, standing in front of a girl, patiently waiting for her to love him. He benefits from decades of cultural attitudes that have worn away at the agency of women, of romance tropes that valorize the persistence of men in pursuit of a woman, and the gendered head games that give men the upper hand in most every interaction they have. ,It does all this while also being extremely fun pulp nonsense, which somehow makes it feel ,dangerous. Throughout it all, Joe Goldberg is… funny? Sharp? And, thanks to Penn Badgley, perhaps the best voiceover narrator you’ve ever heard? You , Joe, and, because of a combination of Badgley’s performance and the incredible savvy of every member of the crew that points a camera or light at him, you frequently suffer whiplash for liking him, as he goes from charming book nerd to sardonic lead to super creep in the same shot. ,What we call prestige television is often a function of marketing.

136,"Netflix’s The Witcher is a dark, funny, and faithful adaptation of the fantasy series",2019-12-20,Andrew Webster,"You learn nearly everything you need to know about , hero Geralt (Henry Cavill) a few minutes into the first episode. The titular witcher — a work-for-hire monster hunter with some helpful superpowers — is first seen in a swamp, nearly killed by a giant spider monster, beaten and almost drowned. In the next scene, Geralt heads to a local pub for information on his next quest, only to be subjected to ridicule and scorn from villagers who are scared of his supernatural nature. Ultimately, he’s saved from a barroom brawl thanks to a helpful young woman, who very quickly becomes a romantic partner.,The Netflix adaptation captures the enigmatic hero perfectly. He’s struggling to survive in a world that hates him, stubbornly sticking to a moral code that forces him into dangerous  situations. He’s gruff and sarcastic, always down for a fight, impossibly charming, and frequently irresistible. It’s a premise that worked well in book and video game form — and now it’s one of the best series on Netflix., is based on a series of fantasy novels from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which reached a new level of global popularity thanks to a series of video games. ,, in particular, propelled the franchise to blockbuster status. Every iteration follows Geralt, part of an ancient and dwindling line of monster hunters known as witchers. They’re mutated from a young age to be stronger and faster, and the process also gives them limited magical abilities and prolonged life spans. Geralt is a gunslinger type, moseying into a town in trouble, slaying the inevitable magical beast, collecting his pay, and moving on.,In this way, , is different than most fantasy stories, including obvious contemporaries like ,. It does have the elements of a vast epic tale — including plenty of political machinations and lots of warring kingdoms — but at its best, , is like a fantastical detective series, with Geralt investigating dangerous magical creatures and inevitably being pulled into much bigger conspiracies.,What makes the new show work so well is the way it seamlessly blends together these two types of storytelling. There , an interesting overarching story. In addition to Geralt, the show also follows Ciri, a young princess with mysterious powers who is on the run from a rival kingdom, and Yennefer, a fiercely independent sorceress with grand ambitions. Viewers follow along as their three paths inevitably intertwine. But instead of the serialized approach favored by prestige television, for much of its runtime , has more of a “creature of the week” structure. (This changes in the final two episodes as the season rushes towards a conclusion that very clearly sets up the second season.),Each episode — many of which are based explicitly on short stories from the books — tasks Geralt with solving a different monster-related problem, whether that’s a princess turned into a beast, or a vengeful djinn who has cursed his best friend, the bard Dandelion (who primarily goes by Jaskier in the show). The structure feels true to the spirit of the series, while also making it work well for television.,It also means that the show demands a bit more from viewers. Events in , don’t always unfold in chronological order, and there’s no explicit indication of whether you’re watching a scene in the past or present. Instead, you have to sort out the timing based on contextual clues: a line about an event you’ve already seen, or how close two characters have become. (Figuring out the timing isn’t helped by the fact that witchers and sorcerers barely age.) It took me a few episodes to get a solid sense of things. This also means , benefits from repeat viewings, where you can pick up on small details you may have missed the first time.,The most important part of ,, though, is Geralt himself. I’ll admit: I was nervous after seeing the initial photos of Henry Cavill in a Party City-esque white wig, but he absolutely nails the role. His Geralt is the exact right blend of scary, sexy, and sarcastic. Even his gravelly voice is perfect. The wig may look strange at times, but ultimately it doesn’t distract from what makes Geralt interesting. You even get to see him in multiple ,.,As a TV show, , is particularly refreshing in an era full of nihilistic fantasy stories inspired by ,. Yes, the show gets brutal at times. The wonderfully choreographed fight scenes are extremely violent, as is one very particular and hard-to-watch magical transformation. It’s a show where — shock! — the bad guys are usually humans, not monsters. What makes , feel different, though, is in the details. These stories aren’t full of people being awful for the sake of it; they’re making choices based on love or survival, and then things go wrong. What makes , so compelling is how it delves into these gray areas, exploring why people do what they do. By the end, you’ll have some measure of sympathy for almost everyone, no matter how irredeemable they might seem at first.,Crucially, , has a sense of humor. It’s not all dark and dire. Jaskier (Joey Batey) frequently plays the comedy relief, following Geralt around despite not being welcome, in order to turn Geralt’s exploits into song, sometimes breaking the fourth wall in the process. “There I go again,” he says at one point, “just delivering exposition.” When he meets the witcher for the first time, the bard tells him “I love the way you just sit in a corner and brood.” Meanwhile, Geralt’s quietly sarcastic nature is on full display. He can cut through any situation, no matter how awkward or horrible, with a frustrated “fuck.” And one of the show’s most dramatic sex scenes is accompanied by a playful jig and gawking onlookers making jokes.,could’ve very easily turned out wrong. It’s not hard to misinterpret what it is that actually makes the series interesting, but the TV adaptation gets it. ,is funny, intense, and uncomfortable, and it balances out those disparate emotions almost perfectly.

138,"New trailers: Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, Top Gun: Maverick, and more",2019-12-21,Jacob Kastrenakes,"Alright everyone, it’s time for ,. I’m writing this before I’ve seen the new movie, so instead I’m going to write about ,, which I think did some very smart things to set up this film, even if it may have also made life a little trickier for J.J. in other ways, too.,The smartest thing , did for the trilogy was kill off Snoke — an empty plot device — and set up Kylo Ren as the ultimate villain. The absolutely palpable tension between Rey and Kylo (and more broadly, their shared battle between light and dark) gives the story a core worth caring about. The trilogy is all about these two people, even if, you know, the entire galaxy is at stake too. (Trailers suggest , brings in a new ultimate villain, and I question whether that’s the right decision.),What I think makes things trickier is how , ends. It’s fully open for Abrams to take where he’d like. That may be quite freeing, but it also means that — despite being eight films into a nine film saga — there’s no obvious next step, let alone an end point beyond the good guys winning this round. Abrams keeps talking about tying up eight films’ worth of plot, but the problem is, that’s not really true. It’s mostly just been film after film, without a clear trajectory. I think that’s part of the fun of these movies, but it also makes for difficult endings when so much of the framework has to be established within the final movie.,Check out 11 trailers from this week below.,(P.S. I’m off for the holidays next week, but I’ll see you all again in 2020!),Here’s the latest from Christopher Nolan. ,, which he wrote and directed, appears to be  a time-bending action thriller that has its heroes trying to stop a bad guy or something (IDK they mention World War III and nukes) while other characters are going backward in time in front of them. The visual effect is very trippy and a little weird to watch, but I imagine it’ll make for a cool premise. The film comes out July 17th. (I must note, I’m not sure I’ve seen a trailer before that ends with the message: “SEE THE TRAILER IN THEATERS FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT.” What effect? What? Vision? It’s just bigger!),I didn’t realize this when the first trailer for , came out: the entire film is presented as if it were a single unbroken shot. Long takes are an effect that can easily be misused, but I get the impression that it makes a lot of sense here — the film is about two soldiers racing across France to deliver an urgent message about an impending ambush, and the unbroken shot should play up the impact of that ticking clock. It comes out January 10th.,I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a trailer quite like this. The new trailer for , is basically just a triumphant dose of nostalgia — two minutes of ,Top Gun,? — without actually getting into the substance of the movie at all.

It comes out May 15th.,Here’s the latest trailer for ,, Pixar’s fantasy twist on a road movie. Despite the cute mashup, the premise and world somehow still feel familiar, and it’s kind of tempering my interest.

The film comes out March 6th. ,Written and directed by Eliza Hittman, , is about a teenage girl who travels from rural Pennsylvania to New York City to get an abortion, where consent of a parent isn’t required.

139,Galavant was the decade’s most underrated show that no one watched,2019-12-18,Chaim Gartenberg,"“,” ,So begins the tale of ,, , that ran in 2015 and (somehow) returned for an even longer second season the following year.,On the surface, it’s a generic send-off of the fantasy genre that plays like a watered down version of , (with a little less heart and a little more snark). But , has a trick up its sleeve — it’s also a musical, a song-and-dance affair like a live-action Disney movie of old. , like a Disney movie, in fact, given that the songs were all written by the legendary Alan Menken (,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,) and co-collaborator Glenn Slater. ,The show starts by setting up a classic fairy-tale story in its , — Galavant is a gallant knight, riding to save his beloved Madalena from the clutches wicked King Richard — and then promptly blows the entire premise to bits. ,What follows are a few hours of fantasy-fueled musical comedy. There are jousts. There are sword fights. There are a variety of guest cameos. And of course, there are lot of enjoyable tunes, which range from clever to impossible to get out of your head. ,The cast is great, too: Joshua Sasse plays the titular hero, given equal opportunities to flex his golden pipes and biceps; Karen David is the iron-willed Princess Isabella, and Mallory Jansen is Galavant’s trope-dodging lost love Madalena. But the standout is Timothy Omundson’s King Richard, the initial antagonist who steals the show as a blustering, bumbling dictator with a heart of gold (and a truly magnificent beard). It helps that nearly all of the main cast can actually sing well, which means that there’s less of the awkwardness and auto-tuning typical of a Very Special Musical Episode from most shows. ,It’s not deep, but it’s deeply fun, especially if you (like me) particularly enjoy Disney renaissance movies and stage musicals. Thanks to its very unpopular nature, , is also extremely short, the kind of thing you can easily binge on a weekend when it’s too cold to go outside. To say that almost no one watched the first season of the show is an understatement — it was one of ABC’s worst shows that year — and despite a cliffhanger ending, it seemed like , was doomed to be nothing more than an easily missed blip on ABC’s schedule. ,Except, for some reason, it wasn’t. ABC gave the show a “miracle” renewal for a second season, and , delivered one of the most satisfying sequels of the decade. Season 2 takes everything further: more songs, more episodes, more off-kilter fairy-tale wackiness. The first episode, titled “A New Season ... aka Suck It Cancellation Bear” (a reference to ,) starts with a song that sees the , and features a shameless appeal to viewers to watch , instead of football, the Golden Globes, or , ,. The second season also adds more fantasy elements and specific parodies of stage musicals (including , and ,), as icing on the cake. ,ABC also took a page out the book of the far more popular ,, releasing songs individually on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube in the hopes that social media buzz might help lead to more success for the series. It also means that all the music is available to listen to, which you will mostly likely want to do after watching ,.  ,That the show even got renewed at all is a wild story. , was announced as part of ABC’s lineup in 2014, before being consigned to the mid-season break as filler for , Sunday night slot. (ABC had so little faith in the series that the eight-episode season was actually condensed into four weeks, with two episodes airing each Sunday).

140,What to read and play after watching The Witcher on Netflix,2019-12-20,Andrew Webster,"So you’ve just finished watching Geralt grimace his way through eight episodes of ,. There’s a good chance you want more. Maybe it was the deep world-building that enticed you or all of the monster-hunting. Maybe it was Henry Cavill’s piercing yellow eyes. Either way, you’re in luck: you don’t have to wait for the second season to get more of Geralt. ,is based on a series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, which also spawned a series of video games from CD Projekt Red so there is already a lot of , in the world to dive into. If you’re brand-new to the series, here are the best places to start.,The obvious place to start would be the very first , novel, ,, which,kicks off a lengthy storyline that spans six books. But if you’re coming to the books from the TV show, I’d recommend first delving into the short story collections, which predate the novels. There are two of them — , and ,— and both feature tales that form the basis for many of the show’s best episodes. The episode “Rare Species,” for instance, is based on the story “The Bounds of Reason” from ,, while the disturbing story “The Witcher” in , is the core of the episode “The Betrayer Moon.”,There are differences between the books and the show, of course. The Netflix series also weaves in an overarching story about warring kingdoms and the importance of destiny, which is largely absent from the short stories. But the two complement each other well, and they follow a similar structure, jumping back and forth in time with reckless abandon. In my opinion at least, , is at its best in this more standalone format, with Geralt investigating a new monster-related tragedy in each story. These two books will give you plenty of that.,You might be tempted to start from the beginning when it comes to the games. But I’d recommend sticking with the most recent entry in the series. Unlike books, games tend to age poorly, and this is particularly true for RPGs where quality-of-life updates can make older titles a chore to play through. But 2015’s , still feels fantastic today, and it’s the best — and most ambitious — entry in the series. It shifts things toward an open-world structure, and it’s filled with the same morally complex storytelling that makes the TV show so compelling. The two don’t cross over much, though; Netflix’s , is explicitly based on the books. And despite the three in the title, you don’t need to play the previous games to understand what’s going on.,Now is also the best time to play ,. For one thing, the game received two massive expansions, so if you’re just starting, you have , of video game in front of you. (The main story lasts dozens of hours on its own.) But it’s also very accessible. It’s available on a huge range of platforms, and it’s frequently on sale. Just yesterday, ,launched on Xbox Game Pass, making it free for subscribers to play. It’s even on the Nintendo Switch. While the Switch version suffers from a technical standpoint — the graphics and performance both take a hit on the smaller screen — much like , and other open-world games, , benefits greatly from being playable on the go where you can sneak in a quest or two in otherwise idle periods of time.",so you ve just finished watching geralt grimace his way through eight episodes of there s a good

Fresh off the second season of her acclaimed show ,, the writer / actor / producer inked a blockbuster , in September. She’s emerged at the end of 2019 as one of the biggest names in TV, having worked on the script for the upcoming James Bond film, started on a brand-new HBO show, hosted Saturday Night Live, and won big at the Emmys for ,, in which Waller-Bridge plays the title character, is based on a play she wrote and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2013. Season 1 premiered in 2016, but the show practically went viral when the second season came out this summer. It was praised from start to finish for its brilliance and charm.

It can be painfully embarrassing at times, yet still irresistible to watch. And even at its most hyperbolic and cringeworthy moments, it still manages to feel real. It’s unflinching and fearless in its honesty and willingness to show Fleabag’s vulnerability. It’s funny, it’s heartbreaking, it’s layered, it’s raw, it’s genuine. ,One of Waller-Bridge’s big moments came during , where ,won for Outstanding Comedy Series, and Waller-Bridge won for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

144,The Mandalorian shows why Star Wars should be smaller ,2019-12-28,Joshua Rivera,"Two months ago, just before , was about to premiere on Disney+, I made a joke to some friends: wouldn’t it be funny if this show was better than ,? I thought it was unlikely, but possible: ending a trilogy well is hard, and , didn’t have nearly as many expectations riding on it. Eight weeks later and , is out, a very profitable ,, and , concludes its first season with a finale that doesn’t try for much, but also rocks. It is, surprisingly, the better Star War.,(Very mild spoilers to follow.),Most of the reasons why I like , boil down to restraint: It’s full of things most Star Wars movies , do. It doesn’t have a Jedi, or anyone who’s even , of the Force. It’s not about a Chosen One. It’s not even particularly concerned with its place in any grand narrative — sure, the show makes it easy to figure out that it’s set after , and there are a number of familiar , accoutrements. But its overall story? Very much doing its own thing. ,Let’s recap: The eponymous Mandalorian is a bounty hunter who takes a high-paying job for a former Imperial officer. That job turns out to be a child with special powers. He decides not to hand the child over to the definitely evil Imperial holdouts, and goes on the run. The stoic Mandalorian and the adorable baby have adventures, most of them aiming for you to say, “Hey, that’s cool” about two or three times per episode. ,I love how inconsequential , feels, especially since the , films have been about people doing Big Important Things involving the fate of the galaxy or whatever. It even ends with a reassertion of the status quo: Mando and The Child, out and about. What will they find next?,A big part of the , charm is the way that it feels like a world you can live in. And ,? It shows people just trying to get by, out in the galactic equivalent of a small midwestern farm town. Sure, the Empire has fallen and the New Republic is starting to get its feet (only to fall again by the time , rolls around) but none of that matters. Out here, they’re just trying to raise ugly lizards and gas up their spaceships so they can make it to the next job. ,Now that I’ve seen it, this is the , I want more of. Smaller stories, about smaller people, being noble or selfish in ways that ripple through their own communities, not the whole damn galaxy. It’s this implication at the heart of , that made that movie so compelling, and the diversions , made into the lives of Clone Troopers fascinating to watch.
